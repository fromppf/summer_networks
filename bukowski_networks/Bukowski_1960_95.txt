        Bukowski, Charles :  the lady in red [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   people went into vacant lots and pulled up greens to cook and the
2   men rolled Bull Durham or smoked Wings (10¢ a pack) and the
3   dogs were thin and the cats were thin and the cats learned how to
4   catch mice and rats and the dogs caught and killed the cats (some
5   of the cats), and gophers tore up the earth and people killed them
6   by attaching garden hoses to the exhaust pipes of their cars and
7   sticking the hoses into the gopher holes and when the gophers
8   came out the cats and the dogs and the people were afraid of
9   them, they circled and showed their long thin teeth, then they
10   stopped and shivered and as they did the cats rushed in followed
11   by the dogs. people raised chickens in their back yards and the
12   roosters were weak and the hens were thin and the people ate
13   them if they didn't lay eggs fast enough, and the best time of all
14   was when John Dillinger escaped from jail, and one of the
15   saddest times of all was when the Lady in Red fingered him and
16   he was gunned down coming out of that movie.
17   Pretty Boy Floyd, Baby Face Nelson, Machine Gun Kelly, Ma
18   Barker, Alvin Karpis, we loved them all. and there were always
19   wars starting in China and they never lasted long but the
20   newspapers had big black headlines: WAR IN CHINA!
21   the '30s were a time when people had very little and there was
22   nothing to hide behind, and that Bull Durham tag dangling from
23   the string coming out of your pocket---that showed you had it,
24   you could roll with one hand---plenty of time to practice and if
25   somebody looked at you wrong or said something you didn't
26   like you cracked him one right in the mouth. it was a glorious
27   non-bullshit time, especially after we got rid of Herbert Hoover.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the stink [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   when I was eleven or twelve one summer I used to hitchhike 20
2   miles to the beach and look at the water and the sand, it was
3   all much cleaner then and every day this fat woman would
4   drag her dog by on a leash pulling him through the water as
5   she walked along
6   the dog was big and wet and beaten and cowed and the fat
7   woman smelled of whiskey
8   the wind brought it to me
9   and I don't think the sea gulls liked it
10   and I hated that woman and her whiskey smell
11   and what she did to that dog
12   I would have killed her if I could
13   she was so terribly fat
14   she was bunches of fat hanging out of her
15   bathing suit
16   and the whiskey smell
17   and the terrified dog.
18   I couldn't understand what was wrong with her or why she
19   did it
20   why she needed whiskey.
21   there was nothing in my life as ugly as she was.


22   now I have been drunk for 40 years and I hear all the
23   voices of those I have known as one voice:
24   "you just aren't yourself when you get drunk, you are
25   one of the meanest drunks I have ever seen, you are
26   disgusting ..."


27   well, I don't ask them to hang around and they don't.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the lisp [from Dangling in the Tournefortia
        (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I had her for 3 units
2   and at mid-term
3   she'd read off how many assignments
4   stories
5   had been turned in:
6   "Gilbert: 2 ...
7   Ginsing: 5 ...
8   McNulty: 4 ...
9   Frijoles: none ...
10   Lansford: 2 ...
11   Bukowski: 38 ..."


12   the class laughed
13   and she lisped
14   that not only did Bukowski
15   write many stories
16   but that they were all of
17   high quality.


18   she flashed her golden legs
19   in 1940 and there was something
20   sexy about her lisp
21   sexy as a hornet
22   as a rattler
23   that lisp.


24   and she lisped to me
25   after class
26   that I should go to
27   war,
28   that I would make a

[Page 16 ]


29   very good sailor,
30   and she told me about how
31   she took my stories home
32   and read them to her husband
33   and how they both laughed,
34   and I told her, "o.k., Mrs. Anderson."
35   and I'd walk out on the campus
36   where almost every guy had a
37   girl.


38   I didn't become a sailor,
39   Mrs. Anderson, I'm not crazy
40   about the ocean
41   and I didn't like war
42   even when it was the popular
43   thing to
44   do.


45   but here's another completed assignment
46   for you
47   those golden legs
48   that lisp
49   still has me typing
50   love songs.


[Page 17 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  silk [from Dangling in the Tournefortia
        (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   silken kneecaps
2   blue garters
3   pink garters
4   all through the depression
5   better than the
6   N.R.A.
7   the W.P.A.
8   silken legs for
9   Cagney and Gable and
10   all the boys in the neighborhood.


11   now that pantyhose is worn
12   a man no longer gets to watch
13   a strange woman on the streets
14   with her fine legs
15   pulling her stockings up
16   stretching that silk over the
17   kneecaps
18   with just a glimpse of white flesh
19   and pink petticoat ...
20   I suppose it's best, though, that
21   women be comfortable.
22   I wouldn't like to go around pulling
23   /my/ stockings up
24   continually, yet
25   some of us who remember
26   are still wistful about that era
27   dreaming of those legs of the
28   1930s


29   legs no longer beautiful now

[Page 18 ]


30   or legs that are dead
31   simply bone
32   but legs we remember the other
33   way
34   those legs that kept the silkworms
35   busy
36   legs that were for our fathers
37   our uncles
38   legs for Cagney and Gable and
39   all the boys in the neighborhood.

        Bukowski, Charles :  on shooting [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I think I'd like to put one
2   bullet
3   just in front of one of the rear legs
4   of one of those big grey wrinkled
5   elephants


6   and I'd like to be on the roof
7   and put one shot into the Goodyear
8   blimp


9   as a boy I never got to do
10   the things I wanted to do
11   like peek under the dress of
12   the lady next door
13   without her knowing I was
14   doing it


15   I'd get to see all the way up her
16   legs
17   to the panties
18   and they'd be
19   /pink/ .


20   I'd like to shoot an
21   alligator
22   right below the eye
23   and see him whirl the
24   waters muddy.


25   I'd like to put a bullet into
26   a church steeple

[Page 20 ]


27   even though I'm neither a believer nor
28   a disbeliever


29   I'd like to stand on a high ledge
30   and rip 8 or ten shots into the
31   Pacific Ocean.


32   if the lady next door had only
33   let me look up her legs /without/
34   her knowing it


35   I remember her name:
36   Mabel
37   and she'd talk to me
38   and her face was full of sexy
39   wrinkles and sadness
40   her eyes were tiny shots of
41   blue water
42   deathly and bland
43   but her legs were magic and
44   teasing
45   double pillars of maddening
46   thou-shalt-not-have
47   in high black pumps and nylon
48   with her cost accountant husband
49   getting it
50   all.


51   she knew what I
52   wanted
53   her tiny smile
54   told me.


55   Mabel, you
56   whore.

        Bukowski, Charles :  blue collar solitude [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   picking up two six-packs
2   after work
3   to hell with dinner
4   going to the apartment
5   and stripping down
6   to your shorts
7   throwing your clothes
8   on the floor
9   climbing onto the bed
10   no shower
11   no bath
12   sitting up against
13   the pillow
14   and cracking open
15   the first tall beer can
16   lighting a cigarette
17   nothing to do
18   nobody to talk to
19   looking at the wallpaper
20   yesterday's dishes
21   stacked in the sink
22   look out the window
23   the room getting darker
24   open the second can
25   of beer
26   no wife
27   no tv
28   no children


29   sitting in your
30   underwear

[Page 22 ]


31   drinking beer
32   alone


33   everything's gone
34   the foreman
35   the time clock
36   the grocery store clerks
37   the newspaper
38   the coffee shops


39   the phone rings
40   you listen
41   and listen and
42   listen


43   until it stops


44   another beer


45   hearing the breath
46   whistle up your
47   nostrils


48   wiggling the right
49   toe


50   watching
51   it.

        Bukowski, Charles :  sick [from Dangling in the Tournefortia
        (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I had this night job and I'd sit in bed
2   looking out the window in the late afternoon
3   the last of the sun filtering into the room
4   through the leaves and branches of a large green bush
5   and when I thought about what was out there
6   waiting, I'd reach for the telephone.
7   the office clerk knew my voice:
8   "yes, Bukowski, what is it this time?"
9   "just write something down," I'd tell him,
10   "common cold, flu, the clap ..."
11   I'd hang up.
12   it was good watching it slowly get dark
13   listening to people coming home
14   parking their cars, turning on their tv's
15   making kitchen sounds, talking.


16   then I'd get up and drink for three or four hours
17   alone,
18   then go back to bed and sleep.


19   and the next night at the factory everybody
20   would seem very small and wrinkled
21   and I'd walk in tall and shining
22   eyes calm and cool
23   secretly assured;
24   the men didn't understand and the girls
25   all loved me, and the foreman would come forward
26   to speak to me of absenteeism
27   as I took out a cigarette, lit it and
28   listened.

        Bukowski, Charles :  immortals [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   the old jazz place
2   in the French Quarter
3   New Orleans
4   those great names
5   they went back decades
6   but they were tired
7   those old blacks
8   they were tired and old
9   but they still had style
10   they pumped it out
11   it was authentic
12   they pumped it out
13   and they
14   were drinking too like
15   the rest of us
16   and in between sets
17   we all used the same broken toilet to
18   piss in
19   and they stood there
20   hitting on joints
21   getting ready to
22   do it again
23   for 25 or 30 more tourists
24   the all-white audience.
25   they were great and they were tired
26   and they were
27   overweight
28   most of them
29   bald
30   now almost all of them are dead

[Page 25 ]


31   and I don't recall the jazz
32   so much
33   anymore
34   only that we all pissed
35   in the same broken toilet
36   between sets
37   their sets.

        Bukowski, Charles :  Independence Day [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   it was the 4th of July and I was
2   living with an Alvarado Street whore,
3   I was on my last unemployment check
4   and we had a room on the first floor
5   of a Beacon Street hotel next to a
6   housing development.
7   it was 11 a.m. and I was puking,
8   trying to get a can of ale down,
9   the whore in bed next to me
10   in her torn slip
11   mumbling about her children in
12   Atlanta
13   then sleeping, snoring
14   her belly like a watermelon
15   fattening with green beer and red
16   wine,
17   she was the best I could do,
18   on and off with her
19   for two years---
20   then two kids came up and
21   threw a firecracker
22   FLANNNNGGGG!
23   against the screen of our
24   window.
25   "oooh shit," said the whore.
26   I got up out of bed
27   in my torn shorts: "hey, you
28   fuckers! don't do that again!"
29   they laughed and ran off.
30   "I miss my children," said the
31   whore, "I wonder if I'll ever

[Page 27 ]


32   see Ronnie and Lila again?"
33   "will you stop that shit?"
34   I asked. "I heard that shit
35   all last night long!"
36   the whore began crying.
37   I went to the bathroom and
38   puked again,
39   cracked a new can of ale and
40   sat next to the whore
41   in my bed.
42   "don't mourn, Lilly," I said,
43   "you give a great blowjob and
44   that counts for something."
45   FLANNNNGGGG!
46   it was another firecracker.
47   "ooh shit," said the whore.
48   I leaped up and ran to the
49   window.
50   I was 25 years old and a mean
51   s.o.b.
52   I had nothing to lose and was
53   willing to
54   lay it down anywhere.
55   "I /told/ you fuckers!
56   that's /all/ !
57   that's the end of it!
58   the next time will be the
59   /last/ time!"
60   they just stood there and
61   laughed at me, two little kids
62   maybe ten or eleven years old,
63   they laughed at me,
64   me who duked it out
65   once or twice a week
66   with the most violent characters

[Page 28 ]


67   in the neighborhood,
68   maybe not always winning
69   but hardly ever shamed.
70   one of the kids lit another cracker
71   and tossed it,
72   FLANNNNGGGG!
73   I opened the screen and leaped
74   through the window
75   into the yard.
76   the kids backed off.
77   "go get your father," I said,
78   and I'll kick his ass good!"
79   they stood looking at me.
80   "fucking drunk," said the
81   tallest kid and he pulled out
82   a switchblade, hit the button,
83   the knife flicked out and he
84   jammed it into a tree, then
85   pulled it out.
86   I moved toward him and
87   he stood there
88   making movements with the
89   blade.
90   I closed in on him,
91   he flicked out, ran a gash
92   along my right arm
93   above the wrist
94   and then I had the knife
95   twisted it away from him
96   and kicked him in the ass.
97   "now get your father,"
98   I said.
99   they both left
100   and I stood there waiting
101   in my torn shorts ...

[Page 29 ]


102   a minute, two minutes,
103   three minutes,
104   then I got afraid the heat
105   might arrive
106   so I went back and
107   crawled into the window,
108   got back in the bed
109   and played with the knife,
110   flicking the blade
111   in and out.
112   I took a hit of ale
113   and didn't puke.
114   I felt masterful---nobody
115   could have handled it better---
116   I was one 25-year-old
117   mean rattlesnake bastard,
118   it didn't pay to fuck with
119   me.
120   "ooh, you're bleeding,"
121   noticed the whore.
122   "I'm having my period,"
123   I told her.
124   "I always thought you were
125   a queer," she said.
126   "I never knew queers had
127   periods."


128   it was a beautiful knife,
129   I sat there flicking it in
130   and out.
131   I opened a new ale.
132   I never liked holidays.
133   this one was no
134   exception.

[Page 30 ]


135   "I miss my kids,"
136   said the whore,
137   "you don't know how much
138   I miss my kids ..."
139   her watermelon gut
140   moved up and down
141   under her torn and dirty slip.


142   I had about half a can
143   of ale left
144   and I lifted it
145   and I poured it
146   over the top of her
147   head
148   and it ran
149   down over her hair
150   and down her face
151   and into her nostrils
152   and over her lips
153   and she sat up
154   angrily:
155   "why, you /cheap/ queer
156   bastard!"


157   "baby," I smiled at her,
158   "go easy, I am one tough
159   son of a bitch ..."

        Bukowski, Charles :  one for Sherwood Anderson [from Dangling in
        the Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   sometimes I forget about him and his peculiar
2   innocence, almost idiotic, awkward and mawkish,
3   he liked walking over bridges and through cornfields.
4   tonight I think about him, the way the lines were,
5   one felt space between his lines, air
6   and he told it so the lines remained
7   carved there
8   something like Van Gogh.
9   he took his time
10   looking about
11   sometimes running to save something
12   leaving everything to save something,
13   then at other times giving it all away.
14   he didn't understand Hemingway's neon tattoo,
15   found Faulkner much too clever.
16   he was a midwestern hick
17   he took his time.
18   he was as far away from Fitzgerald as he was
19   from Paris.
20   he told stories and left the meaning open
21   and sometimes he told meaningless stories
22   because that was the way it was.
23   he told the same story again and again
24   and he never wrote a story that was unreadable.
25   and nobody ever talks about his life or
26   his death.

        Bukowski, Charles :  fight on [from Dangling in the Tournefortia
        (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   pretty boy was tiring
2   punching against useless junk
3   his arms were weary
4   and the wino closed in and
5   it became ugly
6   pretty boy dropped his hands
7   and the wino had him by the
8   throat
9   banging his head hard against the
10   wall of the building.
11   pretty boy fell
12   the wino paused
13   then landed several kicks
14   in the genital area
15   turned and walked back through
16   the dark end of the alley
17   toward some of us.
18   we parted to let him
19   through
20   and he walked past us
21   turned
22   looked back
23   lit a cigarette
24   and then moved on.


25   when I got back in
26   she was raging:
27   "where the hell you been?"
28   pink-eyed she was
29   sitting up against the pillows
30   her slippers on.

[Page 33 ]


31   "stop for another /quickie/ ?
32   no wonder you haven't
33   had it up for a week!"


34   "I saw a good one. free.
35   better than anything at the
36   Olympic. I saw a good ass-
37   kicking alley fight."


38   "you expect me to believe
39   that?"


40   "Christ, don't you ever wash
41   any glasses? well, we'll use
42   these two."


43   I poured two. she knocked hers
44   off. well, she needed it
45   and I needed mine.


46   "it was really brutal. I hate
47   to see such things but I can't
48   stop watching."


49   "pour another drink."
50   I poured two more. she needed
51   hers because she lived with me.
52   I needed mine because I worked
53   as a stockroom boy
54   at the May Co.


55   "you stopped for a /quickie/ !"


56   "no, I watched this fight."

[Page 34 ]


57   she knocked her second drink
58   off. she was trying to decide
59   whether I had had a quickie or
60   whether I had watched a fight.


61   "pour us another drink. is that
62   the only bottle you've got?"


63   I winked at her and pulled
64   another bottle from the sack.
65   we seldom ate. we drank and
66   we drank and I worked as a
67   stockroom boy at the May Co.
68   and she had a pair of the
69   most beautiful legs I had
70   ever seen.


71   as I poured the third drink
72   she got up, kicked off her
73   slippers and put her high
74   heels on.


75   "we need some god damned
76   ice," she said and I watched
77   her as she walked toward the
78   kitchen.
79   then she vanished in there
80   and I thought about the
81   fight again.


[Page 35 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  I didn't want to [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I was always a bad typist and I never learned to spell
2   because I didn't want to.


3   I never learned properly how to drive an automobile and I
4   bought
5   my first one off a used car lot for $35, got in with
6   my drunken lady and almost ripped off the side of a
7   hospital making my first left turn.


8   I didn't want to learn music because I disliked
9   the teacher with her white wig and her powdered face.


10   I got stuck in the ROTC because I didn't want to be an
11   athlete and they put me in a manual of arms competition
12   and I didn't want to win and I won and they gave me a
13   medal and I threw it down a sewer.


14   I didn't learn music and now I listen to
15   more classical music than the first hundred people you'll
16   pass on the street.


17   I disdained money and my first wife was a millionairess.
18   she got rid of me and I never had any more wives.


19   I hated poets and I hated poetry and I began to write
20   poetry.
21   and one day I looked up and I was in Hamburg, Germany,
22   translated into a half dozen languages and there were
23   over a thousand people sitting in the seats and aisles,
24   perched on the rafters.
25   I read to them and they believed it.

[Page 36 ]


26   I didn't want to read books but I tried to read great poets and
27   novelists, men who have inspired thousands of people
28   throughout the centuries and the books fell from my hands
29   and I slept.


30   I went to museums of art and looked at the great
31   paintings and I was bored.
32   I didn't worry about it, I don't consider myself inadequate,
33   I consider them inadequate.


34   it is difficult for me to get interested or angry.
35   when a cop stops me for some infraction I simply sink
36   into some great sea of disgust.
37   "do you want to know what you did, sir?" he asks me.
38   "no," I say.


39   I have the same trouble with women.
40   "look, you just sit and don't say anything,"
41   they say. "now something is wrong if you just sit there
42   and don't say anything!"
43   I drain my drink and pour another.
44   "look," they say, "let's talk! let's work things
45   out!"
46   "I don't want to work things out," I tell them.


47   I don't even want to write and when I write
48   oft times a strange word will slip in and I'll leave
49   it in or I'll make a typing error, say I will mean to hit a
50   "g" and I'll hit an "h" and if it happens at the beginning
51   of a word then I'll use a word beginning with "h."
52   it doesn't matter.


53   even as a horseplayer I sometimes don't care.
54   once I was driving to Mexico from L.A. to go to
55   Caliente racetrack and ¾'s of the way down something

[Page 37 ]


56   grabbed at the wheel and I turned right, down a street, and
57   parked near a railing overlooking a cliff. I got out of
58   the car and sat at the top of this cliff.
59   the ocean was 40 to 60 yards straight down and I had never been
60   charmed by the ocean but I sat there because
61   I just didn't want to go to the racetrack anymore.
62   I had no thoughts at all, I sat there feeling neither good
63   nor bad.
64   after some time I noticed three squirrels
65   climbing straight up the cliff toward me.
66   they came closer and closer, they bounded six inches or so at a
67   time, stopped, looked at me, then bounded closer.
68   they got unbelievably close, the three of them and their eyes
69   were beautiful, never had I seen eyes like that, never
70   on a woman, there was no treachery there, and men's eyes never
71   interested me.
72   then, all at once, they ran off, bounding straight down the side of
73   the cliff, rapidly, sure-footed, without falling into the
74   ocean, and I became conscious of myself as a man, and worse,
75   as a writer, and I thought, I'll never be able to write this down.


76   I really did buy my first automobile for $35 and I asked the man,
77   "does the motor start? does it have a key?"
78   it didn't have any springs or a reverse gear and to make the
79   headlights work I'd have to hit a hard bump in the road,
80   and I had to park it on a hill to get it started,
81   it ran for two years without my changing the oil and when the
82   car
83   finally died I just left it and walked away. the
84   drunken lady who had been along for that first ride past the
85   hospital, she lived a little longer, with me and without me,
86   but mostly with me, she died and I buried her one warm
87   afternoon north of Anaheim, and the best thing I liked about
88   her was she never said, "let's talk this thing out."
89   she was a typist for a large downtown furniture store

[Page 38 ]


90   and she had the most beautiful legs I have ever seen before or
91   since.


92   I should have loved her more than I did but I didn't want
93   to.


[Page 39 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  nothing [from Dangling in the Tournefortia
        (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]




1   when I was in
2   the post office
3   there was a
4   black girl


5   there was something
6   wrong
7   with her
8   and
9   there was something
10   wrong
11   with me


12   one
13   lunch period
14   she
15   walked up to me
16   and said,
17   "come on, buy
18   me a drink."


19   so
20   we walked
21   across the street
22   to the
23   Chinaman's
24   and we
25   had the drink
26   and
27   then I said,
28   "come on, buy
29   me a drink."

[Page 40 ]




30   and
31   she did
32   and then we
33   noticed a guy
34   passed out in a
35   corner booth
36   and she said,
37   "Jesus Christ,
38   it's
39   Skinny Minny!"


40   Skinny Minny was
41   a high yellow
42   supervisor who had
43   given me
44   plenty of trouble


45   and it
46   looked strange
47   to see him there
48   human enough
49   to get drunk
50   like that


51   "I don't hate
52   him
53   so much
54   now," I
55   told her.


56   we finished
57   our drinks
58   and walked out
59   to go back to
60   work

[Page 41 ]


61   "come on over here," she
62   said


63   and she led me
64   up a little alley
65   to a wire
66   fence
67   where some
68   empty cartons
69   were stacked


70   it was very
71   dark and
72   she pulled over
73   a carton
74   sat down and
75   unzipped me
76   and began licking me
77   and then she
78   had me
79   in her mouth
80   sucking


81   I grabbed the
82   wire fence
83   "JESUS, JESUS,
84   JESUS!"


85   I came


86   she zipped me
87   up
88   and we walked
89   back to work
90   and punched in

[Page 42 ]


91   late

                    




92   after that
93   night
94   we never went
95   out together
96   again


97   maybe she had
98   been
99   playing me
100   against
101   some other guy


102   but Skinny Minny
103   never looked
104   as bad
105   again


106   I don't know
107   what
108   that night
109   meant
110   it probably
111   didn't mean
112   anything
113   at all


114   it's when you
115   look
116   for meaning
117   that you get
118   confused

[Page 43 ]




119   about a month
120   later
121   she said goodby
122   and quit
123   the job


124   that
125   made sense.


[Page 44 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  taking care of the big whammy [from
        Dangling in the Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I forget which year it was
2   but as so happens
3   every now and then
4   a war between the U.S.A.
5   and somebody somewhere else
6   was getting closer.


7   I guess if we had not been so
8   tired from working overtime and
9   had read our newspapers more carefully
10   we might have known about it.


11   one night my supervisor handed me
12   a piece of paper
13   and I thought it was just another
14   write-up
15   as I stuck it into my pocket
16   and kept jamming letters into the
17   case before me.


18   but my buddy, Miles, to my left
19   said, "hey, Hank, better read
20   this one. tonight we all got one."


21   I took it out and read it.
22   it talked about possible
23   hydrogen bomb warfare.


24   first, they told us that
25   we were just as important as the
26   navy, the marines, the army

[Page 45 ]


27   and that in case
28   all was melted into
29   vapor
30   we would still continue to draw
31   our paychecks if
32   under code 809 we
33   went to area 773 and
34   declared 662. that
35   was it.


36   but what I liked best was
37   that on our coffee break
38   one hour and 30 minutes after
39   being told
40   where we could still
41   draw our pay even after everything was
42   turned into a flaming ball
43   of shit


44   none of us
45   talked about that.
46   we talked only about whether
47   the Dodgers would hold onto
48   their half-game lead
49   through September and whether
50   the new supervisor with the
51   great legs would turn out
52   to be a
53   bitch or a bastard.


54   she turned out to be
55   both. the Dodgers didn't
56   hold and we kept getting our
57   paychecks at the same old
58   place.

[Page 46 ]




59   the government had lost its
60   cool
61   printing that pamphlet
62   and
63   in hidden places
64   we talked and laughed about it
65   a little.


66   Russia, we said, they were talking
67   about Russia.


68   and a big black guy
69   pounding on a candy machine that
70   had robbed him of a dime
71   yelled,
72   "well, I say: let's BOMB those
73   fuckers BEFORE they bomb us!"


74   we all let out a big cheer
75   then walked back to our cases
76   and began jamming
77   letters
78   again.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the Indian [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the old Indian in Texas
2   was a handyman in return for
3   some beans and a shack and some
4   money for wine.
5   he didn't want much.
6   he didn't do much.
7   I knew the rich people who had
8   hired him: I had married their
9   granddaughter.
10   she had everything and wanted
11   more.
12   she wore high-heels and
13   crunched the earth when she
14   walked. it jolted her
15   frame.
16   her hair bounced like a horse's mane
17   as she went about.
18   she told me the Indian's name
19   and I saw him mending fences sometimes
20   a long tan rolled cigarette
21   hanging from his mouth
22   and at the most curious
23   times
24   a tiny blue puff of smoke
25   emanated from it.
26   I liked his face
27   it had diggings, veins, rivers, burnt areas.
28   he was never in a hurry.
29   I wasn't either
30   his back looked like it was tied
31   to a pine board

[Page 48 ]


32   while I was bent and slumped
33   weary and with
34   gut.


35   there wasn't much to do on that ranch
36   for either of us.
37   I took long walks while my wife
38   painted oil paintings. she
39   painted best alone and I respected
40   that.
41   I came back each evening with
42   dust on my
43   shoes.


44   in time
45   in not too long a time
46   the Indian began to die. he knew
47   the landscape.
48   he didn't want the hospital. he
49   wanted to die in his shack, he
50   told them.


51   they obliged.
52   he died there
53   secure
54   untroubled
55   and easy.
56   he wanted to die
57   there
58   and he did
59   with his cigarettes and wine jug.


60   my wife went on painting
61   and grandmother went on with her
62   migraines

[Page 49 ]


63   and grandfather played old cowboy
64   songs on the victrola;
65   listening with a drink in his hand
66   he asked me,
67   "you like that one, Hank?"


68   "yeah, I think it's good,"
69   I told him.

        Bukowski, Charles :  love and courage [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   the one I liked was where Cagney
2   fought in the ring
3   got punchy
4   so he could earn money
5   to give his brother
6   music lessons---
7   the brother wanted to be a
8   classical pianist
9   was said to have
10   great talent
11   but they both came from the Lower
12   East Side, and
13   so Cagney got into the ring
14   again and again
15   for money to help the talented brother
16   become a classical pianist.
17   Cagney even loses the girl---
18   to his brother
19   and it ends with his brother
20   making it
21   (at Carnegie Hall, if I remember)
22   and Cagney
23   punched-out and blind
24   at his newsstand
25   listening to the radio
26   to his brother in the concert
27   hall,
28   and, of course, the girl is at the
29   hall
30   adoring, wild-eyed
31   as Cagney warms his hands over a
32   small fire

[Page 52 ]


33   alone in the cold
34   he listens to the radio
35   as his brother plays
36   the piano,
37   Cagney
38   not knowing shit about music
39   and
40   hearing the final applause
41   believes that
42   all the beatings he has taken
43   were worthwhile.

        Bukowski, Charles :  two drunks [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I was trying to write.
2   I was barely existing.
3   mostly I typed dirty things
4   for the girly magazines.


5   Eddie was trying to paint.
6   he was barely existing
7   but he was luckier than
8   I: he lived in this big
9   house
10   with this beautiful girl
11   who was
12   taking care of him.


13   Eddie and I were
14   drinking together.
15   we did our work
16   plenty of it but we
17   drank plenty too.


18   he had
19   all his paintings
20   down in the cellar
21   of this house---
22   hundreds of them
23   thrown about and
24   stuck together.


25   he painted only with
26   yellow paint run through
27   with black india ink.

[Page 54 ]


28   yellow was
29   my favorite color so
30   I liked the paintings.


31   I stayed over there
32   in the daytime
33   and drank
34   and then at night I
35   went back to my place
36   and drank some more
37   and typed.


38   it was
39   an exciting time even
40   though
41   we were hardly
42   making it
43   and the madhouse and/
44   or skid row were just
45   around the corner.


46   we fought and screamed and
47   drank with strangers
48   and the sun was always
49   up or
50   it was midnight
51   and either way
52   it was
53   raw shit energy.


54   Eddie liked to
55   paint to music
56   and since that was the
57   way I wrote I
58   understood it.

[Page 55 ]




59   "read me some of your
60   god damned poems ..."


61   I'd read them and
62   he'd begin
63   violently ripping
64   the canvas
65   with his brush
66   black across yellow
67   his beautiful woman watching.


68   we must have
69   gone on like that for
70   two or three months.


71   one day
72   I went over
73   to see Eddie and
74   his girl
75   met me
76   at the door.


77   "Eddie's gone," she
78   said, "I kicked his
79   ass out!"


80   "did he take his paintings?"


81   "no, I trashed
82   them!"


83   she didn't look
84   beautiful to me
85   anymore.

[Page 56 ]




86   "do you know
87   where he went?"


88   "no, and I don't
89   give a damn!"


90   she
91   closed the door.


92   Eddie never came by
93   my place.
94   every now and then I'd
95   wonder about him.


96   I even got drunk
97   one night and went
98   back to the house and
99   tried to make
100   his x-girlfriend.


101   I couldn't do it.
102   I went back home.


103   I had to keep
104   typing.
105   I was 50 years old
106   and
107   didn't have a job.


108   I even tried to
109   paint
110   but I was
111   no way near
112   as good as Eddie.

[Page 57 ]




113   I went back to
114   writing dirty stories.


115   I never saw
116   Eddie again.
117   and after a while
118   I just
119   forgot about him


120   until tonight
121   ten years later.


122   Eddie, I don't care
123   much for people


124   but you could have
125   come by
126   you could have slept on the couch
127   or the floor.


128   not much
129   I know


130   but yellow is
131   my favorite color


132   just in case
133   you see this poem.

        Bukowski, Charles :  bad press [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   years ago while I was living on DeLongpre Ave.
2   typing at that window facing the sidewalk
3   he came by
4   a college professor
5   he came by with beer and I drank most of the
6   beer.
7   I don't remember much about the conversation
8   but I do remember that I wasn't very excited
9   by his visit.


10   one afternoon he came by and I had the flu.


11   I met him at the door. "I can't see you,"
12   I told him.


13   then I took the 6-pack he was holding from
14   him and closed the door leaving him
15   standing there.


16   many years later now I receive literary magazines
17   to which I don't subscribe.


18   and in them are reviews by this professor of
19   the anthologies I am in.
20   the professor always praises many, damns
21   a few, and when it comes to me he simply
22   blows me off the page like
23   cigarette ash that has fallen there.


24   I really /had/ the flu, you know.
25   it didn't kill me but it certainly did appear
26   to ravage my talents.


[Page 59 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  yeah, man? [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the court was going to hell
2   all these little
3   light brown guys
4   moved in


5   they parked on the front lawn
6   where he used to park alone
7   and they had him blocked in
8   with these old cars,
9   smashed giant battleships of
10   cars.


11   there was one little brown guy who
12   had his car on blocks
13   he had all four wheels off
14   the car had one headlight
15   missing and the bumper was
16   dragging.
17   the guy was in dungarees
18   and an undershirt
19   leaning against his fender
20   smoking a cigarette.


21   Larry walked out there.
22   he walked up to the guy
23   leaning up against the
24   fender.


25   "hey, man, you're blockin'
26   me in!" Larry told him.

[Page 60 ]




27   the guy didn't say anything.
28   he just kept leaning there
29   smoking his cigarette.


30   "I want to get my car out
31   and yours is in the way!"
32   Larry told him.


33   the guy exhaled. "yeah,
34   man?" he just kept leaning
35   against the fender.


36   Larry went back into his
37   room.
38   he could see the guy
39   leaning there.
40   Larry began to drink Scotch
41   with beer chasers.


42   the more he thought about it
43   the more violated
44   he felt.


45   Larry kept drinking and
46   looking out the window
47   at the guy
48   and the guy just stayed
49   there
50   like that
51   for 30 minutes
52   for an hour.


53   suddenly Larry screamed,
54   "GOD DAMN SHIT!"
55   and he went to the bedroom

[Page 61 ]


56   and got his big blade
57   and ran out
58   slamming the door


59   then he walked up
60   to the guy
61   slowly
62   and stopped.
63   Larry had most of
64   the blade
65   palmed in his hand
66   and he covered the
67   length of it
68   with a finger
69   and then he pushed
70   the tip of it into
71   the guy's undershirt
72   and said,
73   "move your car."


74   and the guy said,
75   "sure, man, all you had
76   to do was tell me."


77   then the guy
78   went to his place
79   and came back with
80   3 other little brown
81   guys
82   and they started putting
83   the wheels back
84   on the car.
85   they were fast.
86   but starting the car
87   was another matter.

[Page 62 ]




88   Larry went back into his
89   room
90   and stood in the window
91   where they could
92   see him
93   drinking and
94   watching them


95   they finally got the car
96   started and the first guy
97   got in and
98   drove it off.


99   Larry came out
100   got into his car
101   and drove off slowly
102   for some six-packs
103   and some
104   fried chicken.


105   he got the stuff
106   came back
107   and noticed that his
108   front door was
109   unlocked
110   it was half open
111   and when he walked
112   in
113   his walls were
114   spray painted with
115   sloppy designs and
116   words
117   he couldn't
118   understand.

[Page 63 ]




119   his radio was gone
120   he didn't have a tv
121   but his electric clock
122   was gone
123   all the pillows were
124   gone
125   the sheets
126   the dresser drawers
127   were scattered
128   the mattress was
129   slashed and
130   the stuffing
131   pulled out.


132   all the faucets were
133   running.
134   they had pissed on the
135   kitchen floor
136   broken eggs on it
137   dumped his garbage
138   there.


139   all his knives, forks and spoons were
140   gone
141   the salt and pepper were gone
142   the bread and coffee were gone
143   everything in the refrigerator was
144   gone


145   and in the bathroom
146   the toilet paper was gone
147   and the mirror broken
148   the cabinet emptied
149   razor
150   shaving cream

[Page 64 ]


151   toothpaste
152   band-aids
153   aspirins
154   everything
155   gone.


156   and then he looked
157   in the toilet
158   and down in the bowl
159   was a freshly-cut
160   cat's tail
161   furry and still
162   bleeding
163   in the water


164   Larry hit the lever
165   to flush it away
166   but got an
167   empty click
168   lifted the lid
169   looked inside
170   and all
171   the toilet parts
172   were gone.


173   he walked into the
174   front room
175   sat on the couch
176   that was
177   without cushions
178   reached down
179   into the brown bag
180   pulled out a beer
181   cracked it open and
182   had a good hit.

[Page 65 ]




183   he decided then
184   that it was about time
185   he moved
186   further west.


[Page 66 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  ladies' man [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   there were knocks at my door at 3 or 4 a.m.


2   my getting up to let in some drunk and crazy
3   woman


4   that always charmed me somehow, even though
5   those women were drugged or drunk and had
6   little feeling for me


7   it was low-level action, going to the re-
8   frigerator for beer, drinking with them until
9   5 or 6 a.m.


10   then going to bed with them those vicious
11   children of the night


12   I hated daylight and to be awakened by them
13   at noon as they stood before the mirror
14   putting on their monstrously red mouths:
15   "hey, can I use your phone?"


16   they came and they left and they came
17   again


18   the mailman used to see some of them
19   leaving


20   he watched those buttocks swing down the
21   lane


22   those high heels crashing through the sunlight flooding
23   the cement

[Page 67 ]




24   "Jesus, man," he'd say, "where do you get all those
25   women?"


26   "you just gotta be around night and day," I told
27   him


28   and that was it, that was half of being a ladies'
29   man


30   the other half was letting it happen.


[Page 68 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  yrs., Anica [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   she used to write me little notes
2   on yellow paper with blue lines.
3   the yellow paper would be torn from
4   a ringed notepad,
5   carelessly.
6   and the paper would be folded many
7   times into a hard mass
8   and when I pulled it out of the
9   envelope it would say something
10   like: "Dear Hank: I am now
11   working in this factory and living
12   with my cat Desmond ...
13   yrs., Anica."
14   I don't know where she got my address
15   or what she wanted
16   I got these letters from small towns
17   in Louisiana and Texas.


18   "Dear Hank: I am tired of this
19   town and am moving soon ...
20   yrs., Anica."


21   "Dear Anica," I wrote her once,
22   "I am still drinking and playing
23   the horses ..."


24   then I got a note from her saying that
25   she would be at the Greyhound bus stop,
26   Los Angeles, at 8 a.m. on a certain
27   morning and that she had an hour
28   stopover on her way to Berkeley but
29   she'd like to see me.

[Page 69 ]




30   on that morning I got up
31   in the early a.m. and drove down
32   to the Greyhound station and sat on the bench
33   with the people and waited.


34   I didn't know what she looked like
35   but a young sexy one got off with
36   this guy talking into her ear and
37   I knew it was her and as I walked up
38   and took her suitcase the guy
39   vanished.


40   "You're Anica," I said, "are you
41   sure you've only got an hour?"


42   "Yes, Hank."


43   pure long blond hair
44   perfect skin
45   green-blue eyes
46   graceful of figure
47   was she.


48   I took her around the corner
49   for breakfast.
50   as we had juice and scrambled
51   eggs
52   our knees pressed together
53   under the table.


54   "You got a kind face,"
55   she told me.


56   "But it's old,"
57   I said.

[Page 70 ]




58   "Yes, it is," she said.


59   I walked Anica back to the Greyhound station
60   and we waited for her boarding call.
61   when it came she stood up and
62   said, "Come over here a moment,"
63   and she took me around the corner
64   where there were few people
65   and I kissed her goodbye.
66   then I put her on the Greyhound ...


67   a few weeks later I got a letter
68   from Berkeley
69   which I didn't answer.
70   some months went by and
71   I got a letter
72   from a small Texas town:


73   "Dear Hank: I got this job
74   I hate but it's only
75   3 hours a day and I have this
76   little place with a garden
77   in back and I work in the
78   garden ...
79   yrs., Anica."


80   there were 2 or 3 other letters
81   none of which I answered,
82   the last, I believe, from
83   some small town in
84   Louisiana.


85   she was the most beautiful
86   woman
87   I have ever met.


[Page 71 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  rock [from Dangling in the Tournefortia
        (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   here were all these males tuning their guitars
2   not a woman around
3   and they were content with that.
4   then they started arguing about who was best
5   and what was wrong with the so-called best.
6   and a couple of them had been famous
7   and they sat there on my rug
8   drinking my wine and beer and smoking my
9   cigarettes.


10   two of them stood up
11   to duke it out
12   and that's when I ran them all off
13   with their guitars and their guitar cases
14   out into the moonlight
15   still arguing.


16   I closed the door.
17   then I leaned against the couch and drained a beer
18   fast and I
19   gagged:
20   not a very good night:
21   it was full of
22   ashes.


[Page 72 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  night school [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   in the drunk driver's class
2   assigned there by division 63
3   we are given tiny yellow pencils
4   to take a test
5   to see if we have been listening
6   to the instructor.
7   questions like: the minimum sentence for a
8   2nd drunk driving conviction is:
9   a) 48 days
10   b) 6 months
11   c) 90 days
12   there are 9 other questions.
13   after the instructor leaves the room
14   the students begin asking the questions:
15   "hey, how about question 5? that's a
16   tough one!"
17   "did he talk about that?"
18   "I think it's 48 days."
19   "are you sure?"
20   "no, but that's what I'm putting
21   down."
22   one woman circles all 3 answers
23   on all questions
24   even though we've been told to
25   select only one.


26   on our break I go down and
27   drink a can of beer
28   outside a liquor store.
29   I watch a black hooker
30   on her evening stroll.

[Page 73 ]


31   a car pulls up.
32   she walks over and they
33   talk.
34   the door opens.
35   she gets in and
36   they drive off.


37   back in class
38   the students have gotten
39   to know each other.
40   they are a not-very-interesting
41   bunch of drunks and
42   x-drunks.
43   I visualize them sitting in a
44   bar
45   and I remember why
46   I started drinking
47   alone.


48   the class begins again.
49   it is discovered that I am
50   the only one to have gotten
51   100 percent on the test.


52   I slouch back in my chair
53   with my dark shades on.
54   I am the class
55   intellectual.


[Page 74 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  platonic [from Dangling in the Tournefortia
        (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]




1   she wanted a platonic afternoon and I said, all right
2   but what can we do?


3   and she said, I like to talk.


4   so I took her to the racetrack and we
5   talked.
6   she had on an Indian headband
7   and she talked about literature
8   and I talked about horses.


9   she was going to teach poetry back
10   east.


11   after the races she mentioned that she
12   liked this Spanish place, the food was
13   really good, and since I had won $65 at
14   the track I thought we might as well.


15   the décor was Spanish
16   the food was Mexican and
17   the man at the piano sang American songs
18   in English,
19   loudly.


20   we ordered drinks and dinner
21   and she talked at high pitch
22   with volume
23   so that I could hear her over
24   the singer and the piano.


25   she screamed: I am really looking

[Page 75 ]


26   forward to teaching! I've wanted to
27   do something like that ever since the
28   children grew up!


29   I screamed: ah ha!


30   I was getting a headache.


31   she screamed: do you think poetry
32   can be taught?


33   I screamed: no!


34   she screamed: I think I can do it!


35   I screamed: care for another drink?

                    




36   back at my place I brought out some vodka
37   and 7.


38   someday, she screamed, I am going to
39   isolate myself! I'm going to be /alone/
40   and really get some writing done!


41   she was still screaming even though
42   the man at the piano was far away.


43   as she made various proclamations
44   she whirled about, a semi-dance
45   with much arm-waving. at times she
46   laughed frantically and slapped
47   my legs and pinched them.

[Page 76 ]




48   the gods will not deny me!
49   she screamed.


50   I'll walk you to your car, I
51   told her, this neighborhood is
52   full of rapists.


53   oh, thank you, she said.


54   after she got in the car
55   and started the engine
56   she leaned out the window
57   kissed me on the cheek.
58   and drove off.


59   well, like they said:
60   sex wasn't everything.
61   there was the soul too.
62   I walked back into my place
63   and started looking for
64   mine.


[Page 77 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  hello, Barbara [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   25 years ago
2   in Las Vegas
3   I got married
4   the only time.


5   we were only
6   there an hour.
7   I drove all the
8   way up and all
9   the way back
10   to L.A.


11   I still
12   didn't feel
13   married and
14   I continued
15   to feel that way for 2 and
16   ½ years until
17   she divorced
18   me.


19   then I found
20   a woman
21   who had ants
22   for pets and
23   fed them
24   sugar.
25   I got her
26   pregnant.


27   after that

[Page 78 ]


28   there were
29   many other
30   women.


31   but the
32   other day
33   this man
34   who has been
35   looking into
36   my past
37   said, "I've
38   got the
39   phone number
40   of your
41   x-wife."


42   I put it
43   in my
44   dresser
45   drawer.


46   then I got
47   drunk one
48   night
49   pulled the
50   number out
51   and
52   phoned her.


53   "hey, baby,
54   it's /me/ !"


55   "I know it's
56   you," she said
57   in that same

[Page 79 ]


58   chilly
59   voice.


60   "how ya
61   doin'?"


62   "all right,"
63   she answered.


64   "you still
65   livin' on that
66   chicken ranch?"


67   "yes," she
68   said.


69   "well, I'm
70   drunk
71   I just thought
72   I'd give you
73   a little
74   call."


75   "so you're
76   drunk again,"
77   she said in
78   that same
79   chilly voice.


80   "yes. well,
81   all right,
82   I'm saying
83   goodbye now ..."


84   "goodbye," she
85   said and hung

[Page 80 ]


86   up.


87   I walked over
88   and poured a
89   new drink.
90   after 25 years
91   she still
92   hated me


93   I didn't think
94   I was that
95   bad.


96   of course,
97   guys like me
98   seldom
99   do.

        Bukowski, Charles :  genius [from Dangling in the Tournefortia
        (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   he
2   usually wore a vest and
3   a coat no matter
4   how hot it was
5   and his clothes were
6   always dirty
7   except for a colorful
8   clean scarf


9   no matter how many times
10   I moved
11   he always managed
12   to find me
13   for my couch
14   and the booze


15   and he'd drink
16   and he'd tell me
17   of his genius
18   recite
19   a few new poems
20   from memory


21   pass out
22   and sometimes
23   during the night
24   puke on the rug


25   afterwards snoring
26   keeping me awake
27   most of the
28   night

[Page 82 ]




29   he'd jump up
30   at 6 a.m.
31   and take walks
32   around the
33   block


34   always coming back
35   with wild stories
36   about hookers
37   or
38   dead bodies in
39   the gutter


40   in a loud voice
41   while smoking cigarettes
42   that dangled,
43   he'd begin again
44   about his genius


45   "if I were a
46   fag or a black
47   I would make
48   it!"


49   pacing
50   the floor


51   "if I were a
52   black fag Jew
53   I'd make it!"


54   well
55   he was a Jew
56   so he'd
57   make it

[Page 83 ]


58   one-third of
59   the way


60   at other poet's
61   poetry readings
62   he'd leap up on
63   stage
64   and read his
65   own things


66   he hustled so
67   hard
68   that people
69   hid
70   from him


71   "this panhandling
72   has got to be
73   wearing," I told
74   him, "why don't you
75   get a job and
76   write
77   on the side?"


78   "NO!" he screamed,
79   "I GOTTA BE RECOGNIZED!"


80   he was good
81   he was a very good
82   writer
83   but like the rest of
84   us
85   he wasn't as good
86   as he thought
87   he was

[Page 84 ]




88   I'm sorry
89   but I was always
90   glad
91   when he left.

        Bukowski, Charles :  overt population [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I'll say one thing: her older sister wrote
2   more novels than anybody I ever knew but
3   the novels kept coming back. I read some
4   of them, or rather---parts of them. maybe
5   they were good, I didn't know, I wasn't a
6   critic: I didn't like Tolstoy or Thomas
7   Mann or Henry James.
8   anyhow, her novels kept coming back and
9   her men kept leaving, and she just ate more,
10   had more babies; she didn't bathe and seldom
11   combed her hair and she let the diapers lay
12   about stinking. and she talked continually
13   and laughed continually---a highly nervous
14   laugh---she talked about men and sex
15   continually and I never criticized her be-
16   cause I sensed she had enough trouble and
17   I was living with her younger sister, besides.


18   but one afternoon when we were visiting, the
19   older sister said to me: "all right, I know
20   you've had some novels published but I have
21   these babies, these children, that's an art,
22   that's /my/ art!"


23   "many people have babies," I said, "that's
24   really not exceptional, it's rather standard.
25   but to write a good novel is a rare and an
26   exceptional thing."


27   she leaped up and waved her arms: "oh yeah.
28   oh yeah? what about /your/ daughter? where
29   is /your/ daughter now?"

[Page 86 ]




30   "Santa Monica, California."


31   "'SANTA MONICA? WHAT THE HELL KIND OF FATHER
32   ARE YOU?"


33   I no longer see either sister, although
34   about 2 months ago the younger one phoned
35   long distance and among other things she
36   told me that her sister had just mailed
37   her latest novel off to New York and that
38   her sister thought it was very good, that
39   it was the one, that it was the one that
40   would do it.


41   I didn't tell her younger sister that
42   all of us novelists think that and that
43   is why there are so many of us.

        Bukowski, Charles :  out of the mainstream [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]




1   after Mickey's wife goes to work
2   he walks to the back of the court and starts smoking dope
3   with Harry the house painter.
4   Harry the house painter has a cowed dog named
5   "Pluto"
6   who whines away the day
7   at the end of a long rope.


8   I can't blame anybody: people get tired of the
9   mainstream


10   I sit inside my place
11   reading the daily newspaper over and over
12   again.
13   then I turn on the tv to the
14   morning soap operas
15   and I am glad that I don't live
16   with any of those women
17   they are always getting pregnant and are
18   always unhappy
19   with their doctors and lawyers.


20   I snap the set off
21   consider masturbating
22   reject that and
23   take a bath instead.


24   the phone rings, it's my
25   girlfriend: "what are you
26   doing?"


27   "nothing."

[Page 88 ]




28   "what do you mean, 'nothing'?"


29   "I'm in bed."


30   "in bed? it's almost noon."


31   "I know."


32   "why don't you take a walk?"


33   "all right ..."

                    




34   I get up, get dressed and go outside.
35   I walk south down Western
36   I walk all the way to Santa Monica Boulevard
37   go into Sears-Roebuck.


38   there's a blue jean sale on.
39   I purchase a pair for under $10.
40   I take the escalator down
41   and in the candy section
42   I buy a large bag of popcorn.


43   then I stroll through the hardware section
44   looking at tools that I have no interest in,
45   then to the electrical section
46   where I stand looking at a series of
47   sunlamps,
48   jamming the popcorn into my mouth
49   and feeling like a total
50   asshole.

        Bukowski, Charles :  time is made to be wasted [from Dangling in

1   I had just bought some boxer shorts
2   and a pair of blue jeans
3   and I had just purchased a box of popcorn
4   and was walking by the shoe dept.
5   when I heard the salesgirl say to the
6   man seated,
7   "I'm here to help fit you
8   into some shoes. you needn't get
9   personal."
10   the man was old with a bent back
11   and grey hair.
12   "all right, all right," he said.


13   when I got to the parking lot
14   2 cars were crashed together
15   and the young man in a new car was
16   saying to the lady in the old car,
17   "madam, why did you do that? look
18   at my poor car."
19   the woman was built like a
20   linebacker for the Dallas Cowboys
21   and she screamed:
22   "OH SHUT UP! SHUT UP, YOU DUMB SON
23   OF A BITCH!"


24   I ate the popcorn in the car
25   and drove home. the phone was
26   ringing.
27   "hello," I answered.


28   "where've you been?" she asked.
29   "I've been ringing and ringing."

[Page 90 ]




30   "I went shopping."


31   "shopping?"


32   "yes ..."


33   "you haven't been to see
34   Cupcakes, have you?"


35   "no, besides she's moved to
36   Glendale."


37   "Glendale? how do you know?"


38   "now, come on ..."


39   "I want to /know/ ..."


40   "I got some boxer shorts and
41   some blue jeans."


42   the night was a little better
43   than the day. the police helicopter
44   circled overhead, they had
45   an apartment house on
46   Serrano Avenue
47   staked out.
48   the police crouched behind bushes
49   with rifles and shotguns and pistols
50   and they brought out one man in a
51   white shirt
52   the blood ran down the front of him
53   a red mess
54   and he was handcuffed in
55   back. there were one or two others still

[Page 91 ]


56   inside and the police threatened them
57   over a loudspeaker....


58   strangely, I lost interest
59   and as I walked back toward
60   my place
61   I got a toothache
62   and I didn't have many teeth
63   left
64   and suddenly a grey crippled cat
65   ran across the sidewalk in front of
66   me
67   its back arched
68   tail high
69   I saw its bunghole in the moonlight
70   and then it vanished under a


71   bush.

        Bukowski, Charles :  we've got to communicate [from Dangling in
        the Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   "he was a very sensitive man," she told me, "and after
2   he split with Andrea he kept her panties under his
3   pillow and each night he kissed them and cried.
4   /look/ at you! look at that expression on your face!
5   you don't like what I just said and do you want to
6   know why?
7   it's because you're /afraid/ ; it takes a man to admit
8   his feelings.
9   I see you watching women getting in and out of their
10   cars, hoping their skirts will climb up so you can
11   see their legs.
12   you're like a schoolboy, a peep-freak!
13   and /worse/ than that, you just like to /think/ about
14   sex, you really don't want to /do/ it, it's only
15   /work/ to you, you'd rather stare and imagine.
16   you don't even like to suck my breasts!
17   and you don't like to see a woman doing things in the
18   bathroom!
19   is there something /wrong/ with bodily functions?
20   don't /you/ have bodily functions?
21   Jesus, Christ, my sisters warned me about you!
22   they told me what you were like!
23   I didn't believe them, hell, you /looked/ like a
24   man!
25   all your books, thousands of poems, and what do you
26   know?
27   you're afraid to look at a woman's pussy!
28   all you can do is /drink/ !
29   do you think it takes any guts to drink?
30   here I've given you 5 years of my life and what do you
31   do?: you won't even /discuss/ things with me!
32   you're charming enough when we have a party, that is,

[Page 93 ]


33   /if/ you're in the mood
34   you can really talk your shit
35   but look at you now, not a sound out of you, you just
36   sit in that chair over there and pour drink after
37   drink!
38   well, I've had it, I'm going to get myself somebody
39   /real/ , somebody who can discuss things with me,
40   somebody who can say, 'well, look Paula, I realize
41   that we are having some problems and maybe
42   if we talk about them we can understand each other better
43   and make things work.'
44   not /you/ ! /look/ at you! why don't you /say/ something?
45   sure: DRINK IT DOWN! that's all you know how to do!
46   tell me, what's wrong with a woman's pussy?
47   my mother left my father because he was like you,
48   all he did was drink and play the horses!
49   well, he almost went crazy after she left him.
50   he pleaded and pleaded and pleaded for her to come
51   back, he even pretended he was dying of cancer just
52   to get her to come see him.
53   that didn't fool her---she went and got herself a decent
54   man, she's with him now, you've met him: Lance. but no,
55   you don't /like/ Lance, do you?
56   he wears a necktie and he's into real estate ...
57   well, he doesn't like you either. but mother loves him.
58   and what do /you/ know about love?
59   it's a dirty word to you! /love/ . you don't even 'like'!
60   you don't like your country, you don't like movies, you
61   don't like to dance, you don't like to drive on freeways,
62   you don't like children, you don't /look/ at people,
63   all you do is sit in a chair and drink and figure systems
64   to beat the horses and if there's anything duller and
65   dumber than horses, you let me know, you just tell
66   me!

[Page 94 ]


67   all you know how to do is to wake up sick each morning,
68   you can't get out of bed until noon; you drink whiskey,
69   you drink scotch, you drink beer, you drink wine, you
70   drink vodka, you drink gin, and what does it mean?
71   your health gets worse and worse, your left thumb is
72   dead, your liver is shot, you have high blood pressure,
73   hemorrhoids, ulcers and Christ knows what else,
74   and when I try to talk to you, you can't take it
75   and you run to your place and take the phone off
76   the hook and put on your symphony records and drink
77   yourself to sleep, and then you wake up sick at noon
78   and phone and say that you're dying and that you're
79   sorry and that you want to see me, and then I come over
80   and you're so /contrite/ you're not even human---
81   oh, you can be /charming/ when you're sick and in trouble,
82   you can be humorous, you can make me laugh, you win me back
83   again and again ...
84   but look at you /now/ ! all you want is one more drink and then
85   one /more/ drink and you won't talk to me, you just keep
86   lighting cigarettes and looking around the room ...
87   don't you /want/ to work at making our relationship better?
88   tell me, why are you afraid of a woman's pussy?"

1   she threw all my clothes out the front door---
2   shoes, shirts, dirty underwear, razor, photos,
3   stockings, so forth
4   and she screamed,
5   "GET OUT! GET OUT! GET OUT!"


6   it was her house
7   and it was one-thirty in the afternoon
8   and it was about the night before
9   (a party)
10   and I was very sick.


11   "don't you remember what you did last
12   night?"


13   "no...."


14   that had been the theme
15   since 10 a.m.
16   me
17   sitting
18   listening.


19   "you always want to make me feel bad!
20   well, I'll tell you, you know how to do
21   it!
22   you really know how to make a woman feel
23   bad!"


24   "uuuh?"


25   "come on, talk to me! why don't you /talk/

[Page 96 ]


26   to me?
27   you sure know how to talk at night with all
28   those people around, I NEVER heard a talker
29   like you in all my life!"


30   my car was down there and I gathered up
31   my belongings bit by bit and threw them into
32   the car.
33   I tossed a pair of unmatched dirty stockings
34   into the rear seat
35   as the squad car drove up.


36   "hey, buddy, what're you doing?"


37   "moving."


38   "you're not stealing that stuff are you?"


39   "nobody would steal this stuff."


40   just then my radio came flying through the air.
41   it hit the sidewalk and smashed apart.


42   "THERE'S YOUR FUCKING RADIO!" she screamed.


43   I left it there and drove off.
44   the law didn't follow me ...


45   I found a nice motel
46   just above Hollywood and Western,
47   swimming pool and color tv,
48   liquor store just downstairs
49   got three six-packs
50   sat in the bed
51   cracking cans and not feeling

[Page 97 ]


52   bad at all
53   tv on:
54   people in various sorts of trouble,
55   man and woman stuff.
56   the total indifference of a motel room
57   was a gentle vacuum.
58   I'd stay a week
59   sit in various nudey bars
60   then find an apartment
61   unlisted phone
62   lay quiet
63   look for a job ...
64   I finished one six-pack
65   got sleepy,
66   slept....


67   to be awakened by this knocking
68   and when I opened the door
69   it was her
70   I walked back to the bed
71   and climbed in as she closed the
72   door.


73   "I've decided that I can't live
74   without you," she said.


75   so I got dressed and we went back
76   to her house
77   my car following her car
78   me sucking at a beer can,
79   and at each signal
80   her giving little signs out the window
81   making faces in her rear view mirror.
82   I wondered how she had found me
83   and worse,

[Page 98 ]


84   why she didn't want to let me go
85   because I knew that soon
86   I would be back in another motel room,
87   only next time
88   I'd check the rear view mirror
89   on the way.

1   I had flown a thousand miles to see her
2   at her request
3   "just for old time's sake."


4   we'd had the night together
5   and now it was breakfast
6   in this Arizona cafe,
7   nice quiet place
8   the sun coming in
9   on the red and white checkered
10   tablecloth.


11   she said,
12   "I can't eat ..."


13   the tears were running down
14   her face


15   "I'll finish your breakfast,"
16   I told her,
17   "no use wasting it ..."


18   she straightened her back
19   inhaled and
20   screamed.


21   the waitress and the
22   fry cook
23   came running out.


24   "is everything all right?"
25   the waitress asked.

[Page 100 ]




26   "oh yes,"
27   I answered.


28   they both went
29   in back
30   and watched us
31   through the serving
32   window.


33   across from me
34   her tears were still
35   coming


36   "have a bite of bacon,"
37   I told her,
38   "you'll feel better."


39   "shut up,"
40   she said,
41   "just shut up!"


42   "look," I told her
43   "I'll leave today."


44   "let's try
45   one more night,"
46   she said,
47   "we can talk ..."


48   I finished her
49   breakfast, paid and
50   we left.

                    


[Page 101 ]





51   that night we
52   drank and talked and
53   then slept.


54   about 3 a.m.
55   I awakened
56   howling in pain


57   she had grabbed
58   my balls
59   and yanked.


60   "you crazy bitch,"
61   I said,
62   "what's the matter
63   with you?"


64   "you didn't fuck me,
65   you didn't fuck me,"
66   she said.


67   I got up and began
68   dressing.


69   "what are you
70   doing?" she asked.


71   "doing? doing?" I
72   pulled my pants up,
73   "I'm going to catch
74   a cab
75   to the airport!"


76   I sat down
77   and began putting

[Page 102 ]


78   my shoes on.


79   then she
80   was out of bed and
81   in between my knees
82   unzipping me.


83   "I want you to
84   stay,"
85   she said,
86   bending her head down
87   toward my center.


88   "I want you to
89   stay,"
90   she said


91   "all right,"
92   I said,
93   as the summer moon
94   came
95   through the curtains,
96   "just for old time's
97   sake."

1   it was on the telephone and he said, look, I'm with
2   Lisa now, I can't do that---
3   and she said, I know, I understand, I just want you
4   to come and have coffee with me, I'm one
5   block away on Western, I just got in from Utah, I just
6   thought we'd have coffee for old time's sake---
7   he said, all right
8   then he said to Lisa, be back in five minutes---


9   he got into the Volks and drove and there she was
10   sitting in her car and he got in and she had two coffees
11   waiting there outside of Pioneer Chicken.


12   hi, she said. hi, he said.


13   you know, she said, you are the only man who can make
14   me laugh. you're really funny and I miss that.


15   yeah, he said.


16   how's it going? she asked.


17   fine, he said, real good.


18   you know Cal? she asked. well, he
19   turned out to be a god damned fag. it's bad enough
20   to be competing with other women, there I was competing
21   with men ...


22   I think I've lived with a couple of lesbians, he said,
23   but I'm not sure.

[Page 104 ]




24   I really miss you, she said.


25   look, he said, I've got to be getting back.


26   I understand, she said, then leaned over and kissed
27   him.


28   see you, he said, and got out of her car and walked to
29   the Volks and as he drove off she was still sitting
30   in her car and he waved and she waved back ...


31   it was a perfect day in July and he walked back in
32   to Lisa sitting straight upright in a chair
33   as if she had been frozen for rebirth at a better time.

1   best was the time we were driving along after not seeing
2   each other for some time.
3   you had asked to see me, you wanted to be driven somewhere.
4   your car had been stolen. no, it wasn't that: it was the
5   carburetor or you needed a tune-up. anyhow, we drove along
6   and stopped at a signal on Los Feliz, and your hair was
7   all combed out and you said, "I'm with Paul now."
8   I laughed. I hadn't laughed that well for months, in years.
9   then I checked myself: was it a purposeful laugh to annoy
10   you? or was it just relief?
11   so I checked inside and found it hadn't been defensive:
12   it just felt good to clean everything up. so
13   we ran your errand and went someplace to eat, and I suggested
14   that the pre-meal drink be to Paul who had no idea of what
15   was coming to him, and you said that he had no idea of
16   what you were getting away from, so we
17   drank to that. then we had another drink with no toast.
18   I always liked your hair combed out like that and you always
19   knew just where to put the ribbon.


20   meeting is more exciting than parting but parting is
21   important if you want to stay alive in a certain way.
22   never again will I see all of your beauty sleeping, wide-
23   legged, immune to me: we've all been cheated.

        Bukowski, Charles :  bad fix [from Dangling in the Tournefortia
        (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   old Butch, they fixed him
2   the girls don't look like much
3   anymore.


4   when Big Sam moved out
5   of the back
6   I inherited big Butch,
7   70 as cats go,
8   old,
9   fixed,
10   but still as big and
11   mean a cat as anybody
12   ever remembered
13   seeing.


14   he's damn near gnawed
15   off my hand
16   the hand that feeds him
17   a couple of
18   times
19   but I've forgiven him,
20   he's fixed
21   and there's something in
22   him
23   that doesn't like
24   it.


25   at night
26   I hear him mauling and
27   running other cats through
28   the brush.

[Page 107 ]




29   Butch, he's still a magnificent
30   old cat,
31   fighting
32   even without it.


33   what a bastard he must have been
34   with it
35   when he was 19 or 20
36   walking slowly down
37   his path
38   and I look at him
39   now
40   still feel the courage
41   and the strength
42   in spite of man's smallness
43   in spite of man's scientific
44   skill
45   old Butch
46   retains
47   endures


48   peering at me with those
49   evil yellow eyes
50   out of that huge
51   undefeated
52   head.

        Bukowski, Charles :  maybe we'll see ... [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   sometime soon
2   they are going to shoot a telescope
3   from the shuttle platform out there
4   and the boys and girls are going to see
5   ten percent more outer space,
6   things
7   they have never seen before.


8   I am for this.


9   our inventiveness
10   our poking around
11   is pleasurable.


12   it makes a peanut butter and
13   jelly sandwich taste
14   better.


15   it is having such things to do
16   which keeps us
17   from doing things
18   to ourselves.


[Page 109 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  pretty boy [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   we drank together
2   I was 59 and he was 29
3   and he could catch girls
4   like a spider caught flies
5   only faster than that:
6   he didn't have to wait.


7   he was a pretty boy,
8   well, he wasn't pretty to
9   me,
10   just to the girls---
11   slim body, tight-fitting
12   clothes,
13   blue eyes, blond locks,
14   perfectly-shaped
15   ears, nose, chin and so
16   forth.
17   also, one of his x-wives
18   told me he had a
19   big cock.
20   besides that, he had a
21   private income.


22   he held a mixed drink
23   while I sucked on
24   beer after beer.


25   "when my old lady
26   goes out to fuck somebody,"
27   he said,
28   "I just put on my pajamas,
29   pull up the covers and

[Page 110 ]


30   go to sleep."


31   "I can't do that,"
32   I said.


33   "it's just a /hole/ ,"
34   he said,
35   "you worry too much
36   about it."


37   he got up and
38   changed the record
39   on his stereo.
40   he moved like a gazelle.
41   there were no wrinkles
42   in his pants,
43   no spots or stains.
44   he was like something off a drawing board.


45   my pants---
46   the pockets ripped open
47   the zipper didn't go
48   to the top
49   the belt too long and curled,
50   cigarette holes---
51   my pants were either
52   too long and
53   I stepped on them
54   with my heels
55   or they were too short
56   and showed stockings
57   which didn't cling.


58   he turned the stereo up
59   loud,

[Page 111 ]


60   came back and
61   sat down.


62   "with women," I told him,
63   "I get attached,
64   I get sentimental."


65   he grinned at me
66   showing even white teeth.


67   "you know," I said,
68   "her pillow next to my
69   pillow; my car pushing
70   her stalled car down the
71   street; and when it rains,
72   you know, we listen to the
73   same rain from the same
74   bed. I could make
75   a long list ..."


76   his grin increased.
77   he knew my women;
78   he had managed to get to bed
79   with most of them.


80   "I don't like your women,"
81   he told me.


82   he got up
83   moved into his kitchen
84   and mixed himself a
85   fresh drink.
86   he had seltzer bottles,
87   and machinery which
88   hummed and clicked and

[Page 112 ]


89   whirled.


90   he stood a moment
91   under the kitchen light
92   his hair looking more
93   golden than ever.
94   then he walked out
95   with a glass tube
96   sticking out of his
97   drink.
98   the tube had little
99   colored veins
100   running through it.
101   he sat down and
102   stirred his drink
103   with the glass tube.


104   "o.k.," he said,
105   sipping at his drink,
106   "first, you don't dress
107   right, you got to wear
108   tight pants so your
109   cock shows."


110   "wait a minute,"
111   I said, "I'm almost
112   60 years old ..."


113   "just listen to me,"
114   he said, "they got to
115   see the cock, they like
116   to see it, and if you
117   don't have a big cock
118   you wear a dildo,
119   lots of guys do it.

[Page 113 ]


120   and it doesn't matter
121   because once you
122   get into them it's
123   too late for them.
124   and you've got to
125   learn to dance
126   because women relate
127   dancing to fucking.
128   they think if you can
129   dance good
130   you can screw good."


131   "is there," I asked,
132   "some truth in that?"


133   "of course not," he
134   told me, "but truth has
135   nothing to do with
136   this thing."


137   "is there any more beer?"
138   I asked.


139   "down by your foot," he said,
140   "you brought three six-
141   packs, remember?"


142   I said, "this beer is
143   kind of warm."


144   "with a woman," he continued,
145   "you must always make yourself
146   /seem/ to be
147   unavailable.
148   you must act disinterested;

[Page 114 ]


149   once she's solved you she's
150   done with you;
151   she needs a problem to
152   work on."


153   "why don't you turn that
154   god damned stereo down
155   a bit?" I asked.


156   "just remember," he said,
157   "there are 6,000 boats
158   at Marina del Rey
159   with at least
160   two beautiful whores
161   on each one of them
162   and you'll never have
163   any of them."


164   "I've got to go,"
165   I told him.


166   "o.k.," he said,
167   "be cool, man...."


168   I walked down through
169   the court and
170   before I could get
171   to my door I had to
172   stop and vomit in the bushes.


173   I finished
174   opened my door
175   and went inside
176   and there was the bed
177   and there were the walls

[Page 115 ]


178   hello
179   and the problem was
180   that it had happened before.
181   I went to the refrigerator
182   and found
183   a cold beer,
184   cracked it.


185   if you got up
186   in the morning
187   and if you had a
188   car on the street
189   and if that car
190   hadn't been stolen
191   and if you
192   got into it
193   and it started
194   then that was
195   miracle enough.


196   I drank the
197   cold beer.


[Page 116 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  the new woman [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   you are sitting with the new
2   woman
3   you've worked out the sex thing
4   all right
5   it's the 3rd or 4th night
6   now you're becoming friends
7   talking about this and that


8   she has a nice place
9   plenty to eat ...
10   also books, magazines, drapes,
11   dried figs, oranges and the
12   like.
13   she smokes and laughs
14   much.


15   so you've done with one
16   woman
17   and here's another
18   one.
19   maybe she likes somebody
20   who lays around and doesn't
21   do much.


22   all right.
23   more to drink
24   more to say.


25   she gets into her x-
26   man.


27   oh, that one beat you?

[Page 117 ]


28   this one took drugs?


29   that one couldn't get it
30   up anymore?


31   I understand ...


32   the last was who? Billy
33   Thong? why did you tell
34   me?


35   you mean you really lived
36   with /Billy Thong/ ?


37   listen, I went to jail one
38   night with that filthy swine.


39   a matter of busted door glass
40   at my x-girl friend's place.
41   I busted out eight panes,
42   he got one.


43   they put us in the same
44   tank.


45   he was so disgusting the others
46   in the same tank
47   wanted to kill him.
48   they should have.


49   I saved his ass by
50   explaining him
51   away.


52   oh fuck Billy Thong,

[Page 118 ]


53   she says, and let's get on
54   with us.


55   yeah, I say.


56   I like you, she says,
57   you admire Carson McCullers
58   and James Thurber and you're the
59   first man I've found who has admired
60   both of them.


61   I'll be right back,
62   I tell her,
63   and I go into one of her
64   bathrooms and piss.


65   it's strange about her
66   bathrooms
67   one bathroom has extra rolls
68   of toilet paper
69   and the other has none.
70   I found out about the bathrooms
71   the first morning
72   I was in the wrong one
73   staring at the little naked grey
74   cardboard roll.


75   I finish pissing and walk out to
76   see her again.


77   she crosses her legs and lights a
78   cigarette: I'm sorry about Billy
79   Thong, let's forget him.


80   all right, I say,

[Page 119 ]


81   thinking
82   I will eat all the food in this
83   place, I will smoke the cigarettes
84   and drink the booze and then I'll
85   sleep with her but I won't fuck her
86   and when she's still asleep in the
87   morning I will sneak out of bed and
88   get down there to my car parked in
89   back
90   maybe taking a few cans of beer
91   from the fridge


92   and then I'll go south on
93   Vermont
94   take a right
95   go west to my place
96   get in there
97   take the phone off the
98   hook,
99   undress,
100   get into my own bed
101   pull the covers
102   up to my throat
103   and start
104   all over again
105   feeling cheated because
106   Billy Thong had killed it
107   before I could.


[Page 120 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  we both knew him [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I knew him before I knew you, she said
2   in bed afterwards, he was always talking
3   about you, he loved your writing and he
4   introduced me to your books and now
5   /we're/ lovers ...
6   you know, he slashed his wrists several
7   times and just recently had himself
8   committed, did you know him?


9   yes, I said, we were in the drunk tank
10   together. the other prisoners wanted to
11   kill him but I gave a speech and talked
12   them out of it.


13   I used to think he was a genius, she said,
14   every morning when he awakened he would
15   leap up in bed and scream out,
16   "how do you like your blue-eyed boy,
17   Mister Death?"
18   later I found out who wrote
19   that ...


20   cummings.


21   yes, she said, that's when we
22   split, when I found that
23   out.


24   how long were you with
25   him?

[Page 121 ]




26   2 years. he talked about you
27   all the time. Chinaski, Chinaski,
28   Chinaski ... and now /we're/ together
29   and we're lovers ...


30   yes, I said, where's the bathroom?


31   straight ahead through that door
32   in front of us there ...


33   I got up, went in, pulled down my
34   pants, sat down, thinking, fucking
35   often has nothing to do with being
36   "lovers" and fucking seldom has much
37   to do with literature and literature
38   has nothing to do with fucking except
39   to write about it when more important
40   things give way, and most literature
41   is pretty fucking bad.


42   when I finished I washed up and
43   climbed back into bed with her
44   whereupon she kept rubbing one of
45   her thighs against mine.
46   she wanted it again.
47   and
48   she wanted to teach me how to
49   dance, I didn't dance well, I
50   didn't dance upon the balls of
51   my feet.
52   and she liked Greece, she liked to
53   talk about Greece.


54   come on, she said, this balcony is
55   just like Greece, follow me.

[Page 122 ]




56   and we stood there on the balcony
57   naked with the cars rolling up and
58   down the boulevard I could feel the
59   air and the sun about my nodules.
60   we stood there. she had false teeth
61   and kept lighting cigarettes and
62   talking and I had no idea what to
63   do with her.


64   then she reached down and grabbed
65   my piece.
66   I took her wrist and from underneath
67   pressed my thumb against her veins
68   until the hand opened.


69   I told her it was too god damned
70   early in the morning
71   for that.


72   I went in and got dressed and I
73   knew I would see her one more
74   time and that
75   would be it.


76   discard or be discarded.
77   it was endless.


78   she gave me a copy of the
79   /New Yorker/ and a six-pack
80   of beer and, Mister Death,
81   I left.


[Page 123 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  killer [from Dangling in the Tournefortia
        (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   it was one of those days,
2   he told me, I had a fight
3   with my wife, a bad one,
4   I just had to get out of
5   there so I jumped in the
6   car and backed out the
7   driveway and ran over the
8   god damned cat, I heard it
9   scream and when I got out
10   of the car it was
11   laying there
12   its guts punched-out
13   coming out of its mouth
14   but it was still alive
15   looking at me
16   and then my wife ran out
17   and yelled at me,
18   "YOU'VE MURDERED THE
19   CAT! YOU'VE MURDERED THE
20   CAT!"
21   "NO," I yelled back, "IT'S
22   STILL ALIVE!"
23   the cat was totally crushed, flat
24   but still breathing.
25   I ran and got the
26   nearest thing I could
27   find, a shovel, and I
28   started beating it
29   over the head
30   and my wife
31   grabbed at me

[Page 124 ]


32   and ripped my shirt
33   and ripped me.
34   "NO! NO! NO!" she
35   screamed.
36   "GET AWAY, YOU WHORE!"
37   I yelled and shoved her
38   to the asphalt.
39   I beat at the cat's head
40   with the shovel as
41   the little boy
42   next door
43   watched me.
44   then the cat was
45   finally dead.
46   the little boy ran off
47   toward his house
48   yelling, "MAMA! MAMA!
49   MR. SUMMERS JUST KILLED
50   HIS CAT!"


51   my wife got up
52   from the asphalt
53   and said,
54   "I never want to
55   see you again."
56   I got in the car
57   and drove off.


58   what are you
59   going to do?
60   I asked him.


61   I guess I'll just
62   get a motel room
63   and get good and

[Page 125 ]


64   drunk, he said.


65   it's strange seeing
66   you, I told him.
67   I thought maybe you
68   were dead, I haven't
69   seen you for so long.


70   I might as well be
71   dead, he said. by
72   the way, how's it
73   going with
74   you and Lyn?


75   it's going pretty
76   good, I said.


77   oh, he said.


78   he looked down
79   into his beer
80   and then finished it off.


81   o.k., he said,
82   I'm going.


83   take it easy,
84   I said.


85   then he was out the
86   door.


87   I'd given him the
88   last unwanted cut
89   by telling him

[Page 126 ]


90   that it was
91   going pretty
92   good between
93   me and Lyn.


94   what the hell
95   did he think
96   I was doing
97   sitting in a dull
98   neighborhood bar
99   at 9:15 p.m.
100   drinking Jack Daniels
101   with beer
102   chasers?


[Page 127 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  I can't stop [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   people keep telling me
2   you know,
3   you ought to stop writing
4   racetrack poems,
5   you have no /idea/
6   how boring they are.


7   well, I was at the track
8   the other day
9   and I had to go in
10   and take a piss.
11   I unzipped and stood there
12   grabbing and groping
13   and tugging;
14   I tugged and I groped and
15   I grabbed
16   and the guy next to me
17   said:
18   "my god, you must really
19   have a lot of it ..."
20   and I told him,
21   "nothing like that, sir,
22   I've got my shorts on
23   backwards."


24   I got it out
25   from underneath
26   and pissed half of it
27   down my leg.
28   then I went out
29   and caught a
30   six to one shot

[Page 128 ]


31   who won
32   by four lengths.


33   this is just another
34   boring poem.


[Page 129 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  fasten your seat belts [from Dangling in
        the Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   at one time
2   I knew two airline stewardesses
3   and I heard a few
4   jet plane stories
5   and the one I remember
6   is when a famous singer
7   (he was a big sex symbol)
8   took one of the two stewardesses
9   into the crapper
10   and had intercourse with her,
11   and all the passengers knew
12   about it
13   and then he came out
14   sat down and started drinking.
15   he got drunk and told
16   everybody around that
17   the stewardess was a
18   "pig."
19   he kept drinking and
20   he kept saying it
21   over and over again,
22   that she was a
23   "pig."


24   anyhow, the flight ended
25   and he got off
26   and later the stewardess
27   discovered she had
28   v.d.


29   that's all there is

[Page 130 ]


30   to that
31   except that one of the
32   stewardesses that I
33   knew
34   who lived in Long Beach
35   moved and vanished
36   and the other one is
37   now in a
38   madhouse in Germany


39   and I never slept
40   with either of them
41   and the famous singer
42   is now
43   no longer famous.

1   she was a class bitch although all her
2   teeth were gone.
3   once married to one of the leading medical diagnosticians
4   in the world
5   she still had money and her education
6   quite classic and her background
7   likewise
8   she sat at her place
9   in front of her full bookcase background
10   hair down into crumbling face
11   into which was poured endless tumblers of
12   scotch and water
13   she liked to correct my pronunciation.


14   "now James Thurber," she said, "JAMES THURBER
15   and Ross, I think his name was, he was the editor
16   of the /New Yorker/ , they used to sit around for
17   hours arguing about the use of the comma."


18   "yes," I said, "while other people were starving
19   to death."


20   "now CHIN-ASS-SKI," she said, "since when do /you/ give a
21   damn
22   about other people starving to death?"


23   out on her balcony she talked about Greece and I used
24   to like to imagine we were in Greece
25   because I was hiding at her place
26   hiding out there because I had
27   an insane girlfriend who was trying to kill me.

[Page 132 ]




28   "do you like Ibsen?" she asked.


29   "he knew his women," I answered, "but I prefer Knut
30   Hamsun."


31   "oh, do you like Knut Hamsun? do you know that there
32   is a Knut Hamsun Society?"


33   "like Mahler, eh?"


34   "oh, do you like Mahler too?"


35   "yes," I said, flicking my ashes out over the balcony
36   of my imaginary Greek island.


37   we drank and drank and each morning I'd awaken
38   not sure where I was.
39   then I'd look over at the north wall and there would
40   be:
41   the giant two-foot white styrofoam "S" she had glued
42   there.


43   I found out my mad girlfriend had returned to Arizona
44   so I went back to my place and sat around drinking beer
45   and looking out the window while
46   sitting in my shorts
47   getting fatter and lazier
48   but generally feeling useful
49   when
50   one night
51   the phone rang
52   and really into her scotch and water was
53   "S"
54   who said,
55   "listen, you think you've been fucking me? well, you ain't

[Page 133 ]


56   fucked me yet, let me tell you, you think you're such a
57   hot dog ... I don't want to hurt your feelings but I gotta
58   tell you something: you ain't even PENETRATED me yet!"
59   I hung up.


60   I drank a beer. I drank another beer.
61   then I put on shoes, pants, shirt, drove my car off the
62   front lawn of my court and got over there.


63   she was home.
64   I joined her with the scotch.
65   she put on Shostakovitch's 4th which she knew I preferred
66   to the 5th.


67   "James Thurber," she said, "is a greater writer than you'll
68   ever be."


69   "I know that," I said.


70   I don't know when we went to bed
71   but with Rod Stewart on the record player
72   I made sure that time
73   I gave her a stinky horse fuck
74   sweat running down my back from the top of my head
75   and from under the armpits
76   the bed rattled like a crazy tambourine
77   her head bounced like a metronome out of kilt.


78   in the morning I got up
79   puked
80   walked into the other room and she was sitting in a
81   chair at 9:30 a.m. re-reading Carson McCullers.


82   "there's some beer in the fridge," she said.

[Page 134 ]




83   there was a long stairway down from her upper flat
84   and I went down that stairway, and each separate step of
85   the stair had its own bit of worn rug and I greeted each
86   piece personally on the way down, each one different,
87   each with its own character and yet each not
88   meaning too much of anything at all.


89   I found my car parked in back.
90   I got it out of the lot
91   backed out
92   looked out
93   looked up
94   because I knew
95   and there she was in my Grecian window
96   hanging out:
97   "bye, CHIN-ASS-SKI!"


98   hair down partly across her face
99   cigarette stuck into lips
100   glass of scotch and water in one hand.


101   there was nothing else to do:
102   I waved goodbye.


[Page 135 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  the descent of the species [from Dangling
        in the Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]




1   Sweet Mama,
2   she liked ice cream, candy bars
3   and chocolate doughnuts;
4   breakfast at her place was
5   lemon meringue pie and hot chocolate.


6   she was 20 years younger and
7   the weight settled on /me/
8   easier.
9   after a while
10   when we made love
11   my belly got in the way.


12   "you're not as good as you
13   used to be," she said.


14   "get on top," I told her.


15   I had to throw away all my clothes
16   and get larger ones.


17   I got so fat that even
18   her getting on top
19   stopped working.


20   that finished us ...

                    




21   the next one I met
22   was 30 years younger.

[Page 136 ]




23   she took pills, drank
24   and went to bed
25   with everybody.
26   she worried me sick
27   and I couldn't eat
28   at all.


29   I had to throw away all my clothes
30   and get smaller ones.


31   "you look awful," she said and
32   ran away with a younger man ...

                    




33   the next one was about my age
34   and we sat around
35   her place and drank and talked
36   about what a terrible place
37   the world was.


38   we also drank at cafes
39   and while we were there
40   we ate.
41   I was soon back to
42   my normal weight.


43   then Sweet Mama
44   saw me one day
45   all slimmed-down and
46   asked me to
47   come back to her
48   and I did,
49   only I didn't move
50   back in,

[Page 137 ]


51   I stayed at my
52   place.


53   and then the one
54   who was 30 years younger
55   saw me and
56   told me I was looking good
57   and she started coming
58   by


59   and I decided
60   I'd keep them both---
61   one to worry me sick
62   and slim me down
63   and the other to pump me
64   full of sweets.


65   but I screwed that up.
66   I met a 30-year-old
67   divorcée
68   from Texas
69   who looked like
70   Katherine Hepburn
71   and I went down there
72   where she introduced me
73   to the works of
74   de Sade.


[Page 138 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  yes [from Dangling in the Tournefortia
        (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   no matter who I'm with
2   people always say,
3   are you still with her?


4   my average relationship lasts
5   two and one half years.
6   with wars
7   inflation
8   unemployment
9   alcoholism
10   gambling
11   and my own degenerate nervousness
12   I think I do well enough.


13   I like reading the Sunday papers in bed.
14   I like orange ribbons tied around the cat's neck.
15   I like sleeping up against a body that I know well.


16   I like black slips at the foot of my bed
17   at 2 in the afternoon.
18   I like seeing how the photos turned out.


19   I like to be helped through the holidays:
20   4th of July, Labor Day, Halloween, Thanksgiving,
21   Christmas, New Year's.
22   they know how to ride these rapids
23   and they are less afraid of love than I am.


24   they can make me laugh where professional comedians
25   fail.


26   there is walking out to buy a newspaper together.

[Page 139 ]




27   there is much good in being alone
28   but there is a strange warmth in not being alone.


29   I like boiled red potatoes.


30   I like eyes and fingers better than mine that can
31   get knots out of shoelaces.


32   I like letting her drive the car on dark nights
33   when the road and the way have gotten to me,
34   the car radio on
35   we light cigarettes and talk about things
36   and now and then
37   become silent.


38   I like hairpins on tables,
39   on the floor.
40   I like knowing the same walls
41   the same people.


42   I dislike the insane and useless fights which always
43   occur
44   and I dislike myself at these times
45   giving nothing
46   understanding nothing.


47   I like boiled asparagus
48   I like radishes
49   green onions.
50   I like to put my car into a car wash.
51   I like it when I have ten win on a six to one
52   shot.
53   I like my radio which keeps playing
54   Brahms, Beethoven, Mahler.

[Page 140 ]




55   I like it when there's a knock on the door and
56   she's there.


57   no matter who I'm with
58   people always say,
59   are you still with her?


60   they must think I bury them in
61   the Hollywood Hills.


[Page 141 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  laid up [from Dangling in the Tournefortia
        (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   Eddie in the back court, I knew his wife
2   and I hadn't seen him for some weeks and I asked
3   her, "where's Eddie, Jan? I haven't seen Eddie
4   for a couple of weeks."
5   Eddie and Jan had two children; they had all come
6   from South Carolina so the people could hear
7   Eddie play his guitar and sing
8   but Eddie hadn't had much luck in Hollywood.


9   "you still writing dirty stories, Hank?"
10   she asked me.


11   "oh yeah," I said, "but don't you think he ought
12   to see a doctor?"


13   "oh no," she said, "he gets the sleeping sickness
14   right off and on. it passes."


15   Eddie was back there with all the shades down,
16   thick grey shades and the sun couldn't get through
17   and some green brush had come up and covered part
18   of the window, and it was hot outside and his kids
19   were running up and down the walk screaming but he
20   didn't know it.


21   I walked down to my place, sat down and typed a
22   dirty story.
23   and that's that part of it.


24   the other part of it is that one day I moved out
25   of that court and soon after they moved out too,
26   and now and then I'll come to town and drive past

[Page 142 ]


27   that court, stop the car and look in there
28   at where I used to live and at where Eddie and Jan
29   lived in back, and all I can think of is
30   Eddie laying back in there with the big grey
31   shade pulled down, just laying back there while
32   the traffic signals were changing at Hollywood and
33   Western, while the hustlers were hustling and the
34   cops patrolling and the boys catching steel in
35   barroom fights, and during the car crashes
36   and while the helicopters were flying overhead, Eddie with the
37   sleeping sickness.

        Bukowski, Charles :  within my own madness [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I have always been fascinated by Chinese armies
2   of the past,
3   by Adolph Hitler, slim young ladies in long dresses,
4   a checkerboard without pieces, flags of any country,
5   policemen of other countries, marmalade in the jar,
6   people standing outside of movie houses, men with one arm,
7   horses about ready to shit, how badly great actors act,
8   canaries at night, frogs in the center of a road,
9   bedsprings, whirling turds in a toilet,
10   paperclips, dark green, beds full of dying, betrayal,
11   fear, dark green freeway signs, chickens, chicken dung,
12   black traffic policemen, the deaths of presidents' wives,
13   how badly great actresses act, the failure of the poets,
14   the really really rich, the really really poor,
15   the murderers
16   and the murdered, the rapists and the raped


17   what my mother dreamt


18   within my own madness I have not been so fascinated by
19   myself, Italians, Jews, Englishmen,
20   the Women's Liberation Movement,
21   Spain, horse shows, the Pope, spinach, the sea,
22   the mountains,
23   the sunset


24   lemon trees fascinate me, palm trees do not
25   kindness fascinates me, love does not


26   preciseness fascinates me and the end of long-
27   windedness.

        Bukowski, Charles :  dead again [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   Ben phoned and said, "there's a rumor going around that
2   you're dead. /Hustler/ magazine has gotten 3 or 4 calls
3   about that."
4   "well," I said, "maybe the dead can't tell, maybe finally I'm
5   dead...."


6   5 years ago somebody started it:
7   "Bukowski's dead."


8   now it's beginning again.
9   they want me dead very much.
10   I seem to be very much on the minds of the death-wishers.
11   it's irritating to some
12   that a man nearing sixty
13   continues to write.
14   it should give them hope instead of
15   rancor.


16   I'll die, my friends, I have no doubt of
17   that


18   but I think that the history of our streets
19   would be less ugly
20   if we could celebrate men's lives
21   as well.


[Page 145 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  hell yes, I'll go ... [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I am standing around the track after the first race
2   no, it's before the first race and the mob rolls
3   and roars as two men are fighting and others are screaming
4   and a fat cop runs in, gets a punch in the face, yells,
5   "HEY, YOU SON OF A BITCH!", blows his whistle as the
6   mass
7   of arms and yelling evolve toward me, one man breaks loose,
8   runs toward me making strange noises, I get ready to swing
9   but he circles off and the cop grabs him, blows his whistle
10   again.


11   I don't understand any of it, go over and buy a coffee,
12   drink it.


13   nothing much happens until just before the 6th race I am
14   standing two back in line watching the man at the window
15   doing his transactions with the teller and he's taking too
16   long and I don't like the shape of his head or his pants or
17   his coat, I don't like the way he stands, I pick up rays
18   from him that I realize /I/ only feel, nobody else
19   feels this and I am telling myself, man, your sanity is
20   weakening, it's probably you who are the slime of the
21   universe, get it together, look the other
22   way, no single man should judge another ... but I can't help
23   it: when he turns his lips are wet, his eyes glisten with
24   stupidity ... we can judge but as we feel, not as
25   we are taught and told to do ...
26   he took too long while they were putting them in the gate,
27   he actually relaxed, dawdled over his dumb selections,
28   calling all the wrong numbers ...
29   I don't like the shape of his head or his pants or his
30   coat, I don't like his ears, his eyebrows, his shoelaces.

[Page 146 ]




31   he stands and we stare at each other and we are enemies
32   from centuries back and I feel this proclivity to eliminate
33   him, we are locked ...
34   I jerk my head up and down, make strange sounds that I have
35   never heard before ... furious with nothing ...
36   "yeh yeh yeh ..."


37   one sound from him and I will be at his throat but he walks off
38   and I have time to buy a ticket just as they jump out of the
39   gate and I walk to the ramp as the numbers go by. the
40   mile-and-one-sixteenth race and the screaming begin, it's
41   always been a war.


[Page 147 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  a little sun [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the whores at the All-American Burger
2   sit in the patio
3   laughing at 2:30 in the afternoon.
4   they have finished eating
5   and 2 of them are drinking coffee.
6   the 3rd drinks a coke through a straw.
7   the rains have stopped.
8   the rains have been terrible for business
9   everywhere.
10   I am reading the /Herald-Examiner/
11   at a corner table. the sun is on my back,
12   feels good. 2 of the girls
13   (the ones drinking coffee) are in pants;
14   the other one (drinking coke through a straw)
15   and facing me
16   wears a short skirt.
17   she spreads her legs and the sun
18   runs under the table and I can see her
19   panties:
20   they are a light blue.
21   I turn a page of the newspaper
22   see nothing
23   turn back to the front page:
24   the weatherman says there's
25   another storm on the way.
26   I get up and walk past their table.
27   they are giggling like
28   high school girls.


29   out on the sidewalk
30   a thin brown swayback dog with
31   bent long legs shivering

[Page 148 ]


32   picks up half a dry bun
33   and tries to chew it;
34   the bun hangs out one side of
35   his mouth
36   as he tries to shuffle it down
37   his throat.


38   it hasn't been a very good
39   winter.


[Page 149 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  another day [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   getting the low-down blues and going into a restaurant
2   to eat, you sit at a table, the waitress smiles at you
3   she's dumpy. her ass is too big. she seems kind
4   and understanding.
5   live with her 3 months---a man would never know such agony
6   again.
7   o.k., you'll tip 15%.
8   order a turkey sandwich and a beer.
9   the man at the table across from you has a head like an
10   elephant.
11   at a table further down are 3 men with tiny heads
12   like ostriches. they talk loudly of land development.
13   you think: why the hell did I ever come in here when
14   I've got the low-down blues?


15   the waitress comes with the sandwich and she asks you
16   if there will be anything else? and you tell her,
17   no no, this will be fine.
18   then somebody behind you laughs.
19   it's a cork laugh filled with sand and idiocy.


20   you begin eating the sandwich, it's something, it's
21   a minor, frustrating and sensible act like
22   composing a sap song that will make 14-year-old girls
23   weep


24   another beer.


25   Jesus, look at that guy, his hands come down almost to
26   his ankles and he's whistling.


27   well, time to get out.

[Page 150 ]


28   pick up the bill.
29   tip.
30   go to the register.
31   pay.
32   pick up a toothpick
33   out the door.


34   your car is still there.
35   and there are the 3 men with heads like ostriches
36   getting into another car.
37   they each have a toothpick and are talking about women.


38   they drive away first. they're the best.
39   it's a first stage smog alert. all the birds are dead.
40   you start the engine.

        Bukowski, Charles :  a gallon of gas [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   "shit," said Wren, "we're out of gas!"
2   it was her car and she was always
3   running out of gas.
4   we were on the freeway and Wren coasted
5   to a stop at its edge.
6   we were in the car with her ten-year-
7   old daughter.


8   "mommy," said the little girl, "I
9   want to go home!"


10   "oh /shut/ up, Adrienne!"


11   the lady's gas gauge didn't work.
12   she had a method of making marks
13   in the dust on the dashboard
14   to indicate how much gas she had
15   or didn't have.


16   I was beginning to understand better
17   and better why her husband had
18   recently divorced her.


19   "well," she laughed, "we'll just have
20   to walk.
21   I think I see a gas station over
22   there ..."


23   we got out of the car and began walking
24   down the steep freeway slope through the
25   brush.
26   it was difficult but we were o.k. until

[Page 152 ]


27   we were stopped by a tall chain link fence.


28   Wren stuck her pointed boot toes through the
29   wire and began climbing.
30   she got to the top, laughed, then jumped
31   to the other side.


32   "now you climb over," she said to me, "and
33   bring Adrienne with you."


34   "what?"


35   Wren looked at me through the fence.
36   "come on," she said, "hurry up!"


37   Adrienne hated me, she thought I had
38   stolen her mother from her father.


39   I reached down and picked her up.
40   she kicked and wiggled.
41   I felt my hand on her behind.


42   "you fat toad!" she spit at me.


43   she slapped me across the face.
44   I began to get an erection.
45   it was disgusting, I disliked
46   Adrienne.


47   "come on, Brad," her mother said
48   to me, "just don't /stand/ there!"


49   Adrienne slapped me again and I bit
50   her on the side of the neck where
51   her mother couldn't see.

[Page 153 ]




52   "you little bitch," I whispered.


53   then I took her under one arm and
54   started to climb.
55   the kid was kicking, she was
56   all wiggles, a little snake of a
57   girl.


58   I lost my grip and we fell back together.


59   Adrienne dropped on top of me and punched
60   me in the belly.
61   "you fat toad turd!"


62   I pushed her off and got up.
63   "listen, Wren," I told her mother, "I just
64   can't make it over with her, she's too big!"


65   "all right, you stay there and watch her.
66   I'll go get the gas!"


67   Wren started running toward the gas
68   station.


69   Adrienne looked at me.
70   "what's that thing sticking out in the front of your
71   pants, toad?"


72   "forget it. look, let's play hide and
73   seek!"


74   "no, I don't want to play hide and seek with
75   you! I HATE YOU!"


76   "let's fight then! if you hate me, hit

[Page 154 ]


77   me! I won't hit back."


78   "promise?"


79   "I promise!"


80   I got down on my knees and she came on
81   in.
82   Adrienne had her little fists doubled and
83   she swung hard.


84   "toad! toad! toad!"


85   she was good, she really hurt me.


86   "now we'll wrestle," I said.


87   I grabbed her and we rolled over and over
88   in the grass.
89   Adrienne screamed, grabbed my hair and
90   spit in my face.


91   we rolled over and over.


92   then I pinned her down, I was on top
93   of her.


94   "you can't do anything now," I
95   said.


96   "you let me up!"


97   "maybe I won't!"


98   "let me up!"

[Page 155 ]




99   "maybe ..."


100   "here comes my mother!"


101   it was true, I could see Wren coming toward
102   us with a can of gas.
103   she was still far away but I got
104   up.


105   "I'm going to tell mommy that you /hurt/
106   me!"


107   "no, /no/ , Adrienne! look, if you don't tell
108   I'll give you /five dollars/ !"


109   "five whole dollars?"


110   "yes, but you must promise /never/ to
111   tell!"


112   "I /promise/ ! give me the five dollars!"


113   "here! hide it!"


114   Adrienne took the five and hid it in her
115   panties.
116   her panties were a light blue.


117   then Wren came walking up to the
118   fence.


119   "Jesus, I'm /pooped/ ! here comes the
120   can!"


121   Wren was strong.

[Page 156 ]




122   the gallon of gas came flying over the
123   fence.
124   then Wren followed


125   "I had to pay a five buck deposit on the
126   can but I guess I'll keep it."


127   "five bucks is a lot of money," I
128   said.


129   "yes, it is," said Adrienne.


130   I picked up the can and we all began walking
131   up the slope toward the car.


132   "I know you're pissed," said Wren, "about me
133   running out of gas again."


134   "it's all right," I said.


135   "you're not mad?"


136   "no ..."


137   it was afternoon going into evening and
138   the freeway was a Stygian river of tin and
139   steel and unhappy people.


140   Adrienne ran ahead of us happily
141   singing some child's song and
142   skipping through the brush.

        Bukowski, Charles :  black and white roach [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   this headline in the Hollywood paper says,
2   WHORES AND PIMPS COME BACK LIKE ROACHES.
3   look, you think all these people have a nice
4   little place in the country? you think
5   they're going to bother to hustle their ass
6   if they have anything?
7   roaches? you know what reminds me of
8   roaches?: the black and whites cruising
9   everywhere, they aren't protecting anything,
10   they're just looking for a bust, looking to
11   get it off!
12   you can't go into a cafe anymore but
13   there's 3 or 4 of them sucking at coffee cups
14   trying to look pretty and macho.
15   those dumb motherfuckers were still sucking
16   mama's titties when they were four years
17   old.


18   look, Fedra, he said, how about another
19   drink?


20   sure. but I mean, she said, do you know where
21   I'm comin' from?


22   yeah. I also know where you're going, he
23   said, I'm busting your ass for trying to
24   hustle an undercover policeman.


25   they make you guys seem so human on tv,
26   she said, but you're nothing but a bunch
27   of mentally syphilitic pricks!


28   he pulled her out of the booth, pulled

[Page 158 ]


29   both arms behind her back and put on
30   the bracelets, then he walked her out of
31   there like that, holding her arms very high,
32   wanting her to scream in pain, he bullied her
33   from the back, trying to coerce some sound,
34   he only made her stumble to the sidewalk as
35   somebody else's pimp picked up her purse
36   from the booth and walked back to the men's
37   room.

        Bukowski, Charles :  you can never tell who you're going to meet
        at any moment [from Dangling in the Tournefortia (1981) , Black
        Sparrow Press ]



1   she came up behind me and
2   tapped me on the shoulder
3   and there she was except the
4   face had hardened and
5   the breasts had almost
6   disappeared,
7   she wore an off-color
8   dress
9   and the eyes I had so often
10   seen alight with anger and joy
11   were listless
12   and she asked,
13   "how you doing, Turkey?"
14   and I told her, "well, I
15   still pass water ...
16   how's it going with
17   you?"
18   "fine," she said, "just
19   fine."


20   we stood like that
21   and I thought, well, I must
22   look bad too.
23   of course, I've always looked
24   bad.


25   "you still writing those
26   poems?" she asked.


27   "and drinking. I can't stop
28   either habit, you alone?"

[Page 160 ]




29   "married. he's in the men's
30   room."


31   "is he a jealous man?"


32   "nothing like you were."


33   "I always try to be best ..."


34   we walked to the bar and she had her
35   usual vodka and tonic. I had one
36   too.


37   "Petey," she said, "is into
38   computers."


39   then Petey came out of the men's
40   room.
41   we shook hands and I bought him a
42   drink.


43   "Karen told me all about you,"
44   said Petey.


45   "and now you know about her ..."


46   "like what?"


47   "she steals all the covers at
48   night ..."


49   Petey drank his drink right down:
50   "who you got in the 6th?"


51   "Iron Mike ..."

[Page 161 ]




52   "he's a quitter ..."


53   "yeah, I know ..."


54   I finished my drink. "look
55   I'm going to leave you people in
56   peace. you ever get down around
57   Van Nuys, give me a call."


58   "we will, we will ..."


59   I walked down the stairway to the first
60   floor ramp.
61   they were coming out for the post
62   parade.
63   Iron Mike looked good.


64   it was a Wednesday in July
65   and I thought,
66   I got away from her, I'm going to
67   bet $50 to win
68   just to celebrate ...
69   Iron Mike looked good and
70   Delahoussaye was due.

1   now looking out toward town
2   nothing new
3   they've closed the horse trails
4   2 rapes and 3 murders in 4 weeks
5   snails frogs wild dogs everywhere
6   we need our own newspaper
7   it's nice to sit on the porch
8   it's best in the mornings
9   my dentist found nothing to pull Wednesday
10   he has hair on the backs of his hands
11   5 high school girls set fire to the janitor Monday
12   Martha says the skiff has a hole in the bottom
13   the wild dogs kill the domesticated dogs
14   they kill the hens and the cats
15   somebody stole my electric drill
16   Brad Evans probably
17   maybe I'll move to Monterey
18   all those high school girls think about is fucking
19   Jamie Boy, that's my cat's name
20   he eats his own fur like cotton candy
21   if we could get a main road through here we'd make progress
22   but time's made to be wasted
23   I've got 3 tv sets and nothing on any of them
24   snake-bite and crow blast, that's all we know
25   never had a god damned chance
26   daddy neither
27   I can roll a smoke with 2 fingers of my left hand
28   that's good enough for me.

        Bukowski, Charles :  on the hustle [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I suppose
2   one of the worst times was
3   when
4   after a drunken reading and
5   an all night party
6   I promised to appear at
7   an eleven o'clock English
8   class
9   and there they sat
10   nicely dressed
11   terribly young
12   awfully comfortable.


13   I only wanted to sleep
14   and I kept the wastebasket
15   close
16   in case I
17   puked.


18   I think I was in the state of
19   Nebraska or Illinois or
20   Ohio.


21   no more of this,
22   I thought,
23   I'll go back to the factories
24   if they'll have me.


25   "why do you write?"
26   a young man asked.


27   "next question,"
28   I responded.

[Page 164 ]




29   a sweet birdie with blue eyes
30   asked, "who are your 3
31   favorite contemporary
32   writers?"


33   I answered, "Henry Chinaski,
34   Henry Chinaski and Henry ..."


35   somebody asked,
36   "what do you think about Norman
37   Mailer?"


38   I told them that I didn't think
39   about Norman Mailer and then I
40   asked, "doesn't anybody have a
41   beer?"


42   there was this silence, this
43   continuing silence and the class
44   and the prof looked at me and I
45   looked at them.


46   then the sweet birdie with
47   the blue eyes
48   asked,
49   "won't you read us
50   one of your poems?"


51   and then that's when I
52   got up and walked
53   out


54   I left them in there
55   with their prof
56   and I walked down

[Page 165 ]


57   through the campus
58   looking at the
59   young girls
60   their hair
61   their legs
62   their eyes
63   their behinds ...


64   they all look so good,
65   I thought, but
66   they're going to grow up
67   into nothing but
68   trouble ...


69   suddenly I braced myself
70   against a tree and began
71   puking ...


72   "look at that old
73   man," a sweet birdie with
74   brown eyes said to a sweet
75   birdie with pale green eyes,
76   "he's really
77   /fucked-up/ ..."


78   the truth, at
79   last.

        Bukowski, Charles :  attack and retreat [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   read to them
2   read to them and drink wine, let the young girls
3   dream of sucking your soul out of your cock
4   read to them
5   read to them and drink your wine, get paid in cash,
6   leave and let somebody else drive the car.
7   but before that
8   when you
9   read to them
10   read them the new ones so /you/
11   won't be bored
12   and when the applause comes
13   and the young girls look at you
14   with their hot bright eyes
15   remember when you were starving in small
16   rooms
17   remember the only time anybody wanted your
18   autograph was when you signed in
19   at the drunk tank
20   remember when other young girls thought you
21   were a roach.


22   read to them
23   read to them and drink your wine, and remember
24   all the poets who think that reading is
25   an important and a holy thing;
26   these are the poets who hate you,
27   these are the poets who read to 8 or 12 or
28   14 people.
29   these are the poets who write of
30   love and honesty and courage
31   or believe that they do.

[Page 167 ]




32   leave the young girls to them, they need
33   the young girls for they have nothing
34   else.


35   take the cash and jam it
36   into your side pocket and get out and get away,
37   get back to your place, lock in.


38   you will be contacted: they'll want to issue a phonograph
39   record of the reading.


40   give the contract to your lawyer.


41   start in on novel #
42   4.

        Bukowski, Charles :  it's strange [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   it's strange when famous people die
2   whether they have fought the good fight or
3   the bad one.
4   it's strange when famous people die
5   whether we like them or not
6   they are like old buildings old streets
7   things and places that we are used to
8   which we accept simply because they're
9   there.
10   it's strange when famous people die
11   it's like the death of a father or
12   a pet cat or dog.
13   and it's strange when famous people are killed
14   or when they kill themselves.
15   the trouble with the famous is that they must
16   be replaced and they can never quite be
17   replaced, and that gives us this unique
18   sadness.
19   it's strange when famous people die
20   the sidewalks look different and our
21   children look different and our bedmates
22   and our curtains and our automobiles.
23   it's strange when famous people die:


24   we become troubled.

        Bukowski, Charles :  no chance in Pomona [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   on a half-mile track in a mile and one-sixteenth race
2   they go around twice from out of the chute.
3   another jock got thrown today just before the first
4   turn where he was stepped on once.
5   he was an unknown Mexican jock wearing orange silks
6   and he was flat upon his back, bleeding
7   and not moving.


8   nobody moved toward him, although he was near the
9   rail and the horses that were then on the backstretch
10   would have to come through again along the rail
11   where he was.


12   there were some moments while everybody waited for
13   somebody else
14   then a few, a very few,
15   3 or 4 men, jumped the fence and the outrider
16   rode up and sat there on his horse. the
17   field was coming around the curve and into the
18   stretch and the men, some of the men, grabbed the
19   jock by his legs and dragged him barely out of
20   the way as the horses ran by just inside of him.


21   by the time they got the jock into the ambulance
22   the winner-to-be came down the stretch the 2nd
23   time and crossed the wire at 16 to one as the
24   ambulance pulled away to the track emergency
25   room and the longest shot ran past around 3rd or
26   4th or 5th but it wouldn't show on the official
27   charts:

[Page 170 ]




28   it was the horse without the jock:
29   the crowd had it figured right,
30   but not quite.

        Bukowski, Charles :  a poetry reading [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   look at them.
2   this place like a bar or nightclub.
3   sold out: poet and audience both
4   drunk


5   now and then a flashbulb
6   goes off.


7   the mike still doesn't work.
8   the poet sits.
9   a chance to drink some more.


10   a little girl comes up
11   sweet, sexy, psychotic
12   holds one of the poet's
13   books open to
14   autograph.
15   he writes. "I could rip you
16   apart ..."
17   forgets to sign his name.
18   calls for another drink.


19   the mike works.


20   now the poet reads
21   feeling put-upon
22   forgetting he has agreed
23   to read for money.


24   after several poems
25   the poet stands up
26   announces:

[Page 172 ]




27   "you god damn
28   shits,
29   you think this is
30   easy ...
31   it's nothing but a
32   motherfucking
33   blood-letting ..."


34   "GIVE US MORE BLOOD!"
35   screams a young boy
36   from the back.
37   it's the best poem
38   of the night.


39   the poet drinks
40   half a glass of
41   whiskey.
42   lights a cigar.
43   hacks.


44   sometimes they laugh
45   sometimes they applaud.
46   they confuse him
47   but most things do.


48   he drinks his way
49   to the finish.


50   there is applause
51   of relief.


52   then another sweet, sexy
53   psychotic girl comes
54   up to his table
55   says she

[Page 173 ]


56   is from the local paper
57   would like to
58   ask some questions.


59   she
60   sits down.


61   he answers the first
62   question looking at her
63   hair and her eyes
64   imagining her
65   in bed with him.


66   "what do you think of F.
67   Scott Fitzgerald?"
68   she asks.


69   "I never," he answers,
70   "think of him ..."
71   waving a hand in
72   emphasis
73   he spills a large beer
74   on her tight blue jeans,
75   saying,
76   "Jesus, Jesus, I'm
77   sorry ..."
78   rubbing his hands
79   on her knees
80   along her wet thighs
81   as if to dry her.


82   she leaves and the
83   promoter arrives
84   with the money:
85   $432.

[Page 174 ]




86   "shit," says the poet,
87   "you promised me $500."


88   "we had to pay two bouncers
89   $68 to keep the crowd
90   from
91   swarming all over you ..."


92   "you mean I was that
93   good?" asks the poet.


94   "that bad," says the
95   promoter getting up
96   and leaving.


97   the poet pours another
98   drink.
99   grabs the mike:
100   "listen, I ain't finished
101   yet, I'm going to read you
102   another poem ..."


103   somebody shuts the mike
104   off.
105   nobody protests.


106   the poet gets up
107   from his table
108   makes it to the men's
109   room
110   stands pissing.


111   a man next to him is
112   also pissing.

[Page 175 ]




113   the poet says to the
114   man: "listen buddy, where
115   can I get a piece of ass?"


116   "I was going to ask you
117   the same thing,"
118   the man answers.


119   the reading is over.

2   (blowing the cigar smoke into Benny's
3   face),
4   we don't want to circumvent the
5   truth, do we?


6   ah, no, said Benny


7   look, the only way I can defend you is
8   if you tell the truth.


9   sure ...


10   then, tell me ...


11   what?


12   you raped and killed this little girl,
13   right?


14   no, no, not me, it was somebody else ...


15   you like little girls?


16   sure ...
17   then you did it?


18   ah, no.


19   o.k., Benny, /I/ did it. /you/ defend
20   /me./

[Page 177 ]




21   I got no law training.


22   tell me, did you like it, Benny? what
23   did it feel like? he asked (blowing more
24   cigar smoke into Benny's face).


25   it was like eating an ice-cream cone....


26   what flavor, Benny?


27   all the flavors....


28   I'm not going to let them put you in the
29   chair, Benny, I'm going to get you life ...


30   thank you, Mr. Markovitch....


31   no thanks needed, Benny, I only do what I have to

5   this one
6   takes tiny steps
7   3 inches at a time
8   in old striped pants.


9   another
10   not so little
11   but old---
12   he looks like a
13   pregnancy
14   it all hangs down
15   over his belt
16   and he ignores it
17   although
18   it must be
19   ^1 / _3 of his body.


20   another is a
21   dwarf.
22   he is followed by
23   a prostitute who
24   keeps screaming at him,
25   "hey, Johnny, where the hell
26   you going?"
27   but Johnny keeps

[Page 179 ]


28   walking in circles like
29   a wound-up toy
30   and he has a
31   large head and
32   it's more beautiful
33   than anything
34   I've seen in the
35   movies or
36   anywhere.


37   I look around and
38   there are these
39   aged and misshapen men
40   everywhere
41   walking about
42   talking
43   drinking coffee and beer
44   smoking ...


45   there are
46   hundreds of them
47   but nobody notices
48   or if they do
49   they are gently
50   polite about it.


51   then
52   a man
53   walks up to me.
54   he is headless.
55   somebody
56   has sliced his head
57   entirely off and
58   I look down
59   into dark bubbles of

[Page 180 ]


60   blood.
61   "hey, buddy,"
62   he asks, "where's
63   the nearest crapper?"


64   "over there," I tell
65   him, pointing.


66   how can he
67   talk?
68   how can he
69   see?
70   he walks off
71   toward the crapper.


72   they are
73   everywhere.
74   some have no
75   arms.
76   others
77   no eyes
78   no legs
79   no feet.
80   one has no
81   mouth
82   it's sucked in
83   dry like a
84   cat's bunghole.


85   they come to the
86   racetrack
87   every day
88   and I am
89   there too.
90   there aren't so

[Page 181 ]


91   many women.
92   I don't know
93   where
94   the women go.


95   then
96   the dwarf comes
97   spinning by
98   his arms whirling
99   rapidly
100   he gives me a
101   good knock on
102   the knee
103   almost
104   flooring me.
105   "hey, Johnny," says
106   the prostitute, "where
107   the hell you going?"


108   people think that
109   all they have
110   at the racetracks
111   are horses. it's
112   not true. that's
113   why I come home
114   so tired
115   every night.

25   she works the register

27   I pay her.

32   there's trouble in the government.

        Bukowski, Charles :  suckerfish [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   Winthrop finds me where I am
2   sitting in the stands at the finish line.
3   "hi, Buck!" he says.
4   " /Jesus!/ " I say.
5   Winthrop always startles me, when I see him
6   it's like a death ray being pointed
7   at me.
8   he is dressed in dirty polyester pants and
9   a red knit t-shirt with blue stripes.
10   he sits beside me smoking his pipe.
11   "how ya doin', Buck?" he asks.
12   I tell him that I am 30 or 40 dollars ahead.
13   he doesn't have a Racing Form, knows nothing about
14   horse racing and makes vague $2 bets on every race,
15   usually to place or to show.
16   he used to pester me in general admission;
17   to avoid him I'd gone from there to the
18   clubhouse and now he has found me again.
19   the horses come out for the post parade
20   and he says, "you know, you aren't getting into
21   any of the anthologies, I'm going to write something
22   about that."
23   Winthrop reviews books for the /L.A. Times/ , writes
24   poetry and teaches retarded children.
25   he will be with me all afternoon.


26   Winthrop leaves for a moment and I have time to
27   check my figures and the tote board
28   Winthrop comes back with a ham sandwich,
29   potato salad and coffee.
30   he asks, "you heard from Zellerbach lately?"
31   Zellerbach is a friend of his who was once

[Page 187 ]


32   editor of one of the leading sex mags.
33   "no," I answer.
34   Zellerbach has recently been canned but I hear
35   from the others there, they ring me
36   out of my hangover each morning:
37   "when ya gonna send us a story, Buck?"
38   people who call me "Buck" piss me;
39   I'm /Buke/ , like in puke.


40   Winthrop asks, "how's your poetry coming,
41   Buck?"
42   I tell him that I rip off 6 or 8
43   every couple of nights.
44   he says, "that's good, that's good."
45   I tell him that I've got to go bet.


46   after laying my bet I decide to watch
47   the race on the television set.
48   as they are putting them into the gate
49   I notice that
50   Winthrop is standing beside me.


51   "Jesus Christ," I say, "I thought you liked to
52   watch them from the stands!"


53   Winthrop walks off in his duck-footed manner.
54   I watch the race: I lose by a nose
55   on a 6 to one shot.


56   when I get back to my seat Winthrop is
57   eating a coffee cake with coffee.


58   "you keep jamming that shit into your mouth,"
59   I tell him.
60   "that's all right," he says, "my weight's

[Page 188 ]


61   all right."
62   "sure," I say.


63   "when you go to Italy," he says, "you ought to
64   demand that they pick you up in a
65   limousine. you're still going to Italy,
66   aren't you?"


67   "I think so ..."


68   "you should have kept your old Volks. you
69   looked natural in that. somehow the BMW doesn't
70   suit you."


71   people like Winthrop have been worrying about
72   my soul for decades---I'm constantly informed
73   that I'm losing it or that I have lost it.
74   when a man loses his soul you don't tell him about
75   it, you stay away from him.


76   Winthrop says, "I was going to come over to your
77   place last Saturday but I thought I'd better phone
78   first ..."


79   "yes, that's always best."


80   Winthrop says, "you ought to get an agent and a
81   New York publisher. Barton is fucking you."


82   Barton is my American editor and all the poets
83   he refuses to publish
84   tell me that he is a shit.
85   that shit Barton published me
86   when the New York publishers were

[Page 189 ]


87   busy playing piss-in-the-hat with the dilettantes.


88   o.k., so well, to hell with details, it is a long
89   afternoon, hot, with Winthrop interjecting literary
90   bits and losing his tiny bets and I get to thinking
91   less of death rays and more of suckerfish and
92   I wonder why I can't just tell him to get away
93   from me,
94   to leave me some god damned solitude?
95   but I am a coward: I know he won't understand,
96   can't understand:
97   each one thinks they are special,
98   that they are different.
99   yet I drop enough hints, I try to nudge him off
100   humanely.


101   going into the 9th
102   I am $110 ahead
103   (I have been playing the horses for 40 years
104   and am only 5 grand down)
105   and I put $30 win on the even money shot
106   while Winthrop announces that he is going
107   to bet the 2, the 4 and the 7 and that he
108   feels quite sure that one of them is
109   going to win.
110   all of his horses are 20 to one or over.


111   my horse wins by 4 and one-half lengths,
112   I wave goodbye to Winthrop,
113   make my way to the payoff windows ...


114   after 5 minutes I collect
115   put my money into my wallet and make
116   toward the stairway
117   and there is Winthrop walking

[Page 190 ]


118   beside me.


119   down the stairway we go together
120   he in his polyester and knit
121   me in my wrinkled summer slacks and
122   sport shirt with cigarette holes
123   with the mob
124   walking down the stairway
125   they are talking horses
126   still holding programs and forms
127   tip sheets and newspapers
128   many old folks
129   creeping along slowly
130   barely able to walk
131   or understand.
132   it's an unholy parade,
133   I would as lief be elsewhere.
134   Winthrop and I reach the bottom of
135   the stairway together.
136   "see you," I say and turn left
137   toward the exit.


138   Winthrop is still at my elbow.
139   "Jesus Christ," I say, "are /you/
140   in valet parking too?"
141   "oh no," he points to the right,
142   "I'm over there somewhere ..."
143   "well," I say, "you better get to
144   your car. see you ... "
145   "see you," Winthrop says.


146   I am free.


147   I hand one of the parking lot attendants my
148   parking tab.

[Page 191 ]




149   "black '79 BMW," I say.
150   "I know, champ," he says.


151   driving on in
152   with the sun roof open I
153   slip in a cassette of Sibelius
154   turn onto the San Diego freeway
155   south
156   angle right into
157   a monstrous traffic jam
158   turn up the volume of the
159   front and back speakers
160   and feel good
161   for the first time in
162   hours.

1   you're a sniveler, she said,
2   you snivel when she doesn't call,
3   I phone you and you're shit-faced on wine.


4   I'm a baby, I said, then too I can't figure out
5   how anybody can live without me.


6   my god, she said, you really mean that?


7   yes, I said.


8   oh my god, you're impossible, you big soft
9   baby's ass!


10   suck me off and maybe I can forget, help me
11   forget.


12   you big soft baby's ass!


13   I'm sensitive, yes. and how can anybody live
14   without me?


15   she hung up.


16   well, I thought, there's two who can live without me.
17   there might be 2000, 2 million, 2 billion, 2 million
18   billion.


19   it was one of the most depressing thoughts I'd had
20   in years.

[Page 193 ]




21   I went into my bedroom and stretched out and looked at
22   the ceiling.


23   I thought, well, I can masturbate, I can look at television,
24   and then there's suicide.


25   having already masturbated twice that day
26   I had two choices left and
27   being a big soft baby's ass I
28   switched on the tv.

        Bukowski, Charles :  drying out [from Dangling in the

1   we buy the scandal sheets at the supermarket
2   get into bed and eat pretzels and read as outside
3   the churchbells ring and the dogs bark
4   we turn on the tv and watch very bad movies
5   then she goes down and brings up ice cream
6   and we eat the ice cream and she says,
7   "tomorrow night is trash night."
8   then the cat jumps up on the bed
9   drops its tongue out and stands there
10   glistening cross-eyed


11   the phone rings and it is her mother and she
12   talks to her mother
13   she hands me the phone
14   I tell her mother that it's too bad it's freezing
15   back there
16   it's about 85 here and,
17   yes, I'm feeling well and
18   I hope you're feeling well too


19   I hand the phone back


20   she talks some more
21   then hangs up


22   "mother is a very brave woman," she tells me
23   I tell her that I'm sure her mother is


24   the cat is still standing there glistening
25   cross-eyed
26   I push it down onto the covers

[Page 197 ]


27   "well," she says, "we've gone two nights without
28   drinking."


29   "good," I says, "but tomorrow night I'm going to
30   do it."


31   "ah, come on," she says


32   "you don't have to drink," I tell her, "just because
33   I do."


34   "like hell," she says


35   she flips the remote control switch until she comes to a
36   Japanese monster movie


37   "I think we've seen this one," I say


38   "you didn't see it with me," she says, "who did you
39   see it with?"

4   hissing and hating

7   you cheap shots of piss

14   dm 10 to holler at what you
15   hate.
16   all right,
17   maybe it's worth it,
18   maybe you don't understand

        Bukowski, Charles :  just another bad affair [from Dangling in
        the Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   Paris
2   is the place you've heard about
3   it's very large and the people seem rich but very
4   separated from each other
5   each person
6   a temple of indifference
7   but
8   when you search these structures more intently
9   you see that
10   fear
11   has become a habit with them
12   they are stuffed with
13   fear
14   and it's the
15   fear
16   which makes them seem indifferent
17   to each other
18   and to you.


19   these grand Parisians,
20   the ladies and children
21   sit in the park like paper flowers
22   and the men roar about in their tiny cars
23   bravely pretending.


24   I'm sure the French
25   have done many things of import
26   but
27   it smells of the past.


28   to go to Paris to create art
29   now

[Page 201 ]


30   would be much like sitting around
31   waiting for a butterfly to fart.


32   I like the waiters and the dogs
33   and the whores
34   and the way the people stay up
35   most of the night
36   any night
37   but there is a chill upon
38   the soul of Paris.


39   cities die
40   like people die
41   only more slowly
42   and people
43   who live in dying cities
44   become stuffed with indifference and
45   fear
46   and when their deaths
47   become actual
48   funerals seem superfluous.


49   Paris
50   you expected nothing of me
51   but I expected more
52   of you.


53   now that we know all this

55   say goodbye.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the American writer [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   gone abroad
2   I sit under the tv lights
3   and am interviewed again
4   I am asked questions
5   I give answers
6   I make no attempt to be
7   brilliant.
8   to be truthful
9   I feel bored
10   and I almost never feel
11   bored.
12   "do you?..." they ask.
13   "oh, yeah, well I ..."
14   "and what do you think of ..."
15   "I don't think of it much. I
16   don't think too much ..."
17   somehow it ends.


18   that evening somebody tells me
19   I'm on the news
20   we turn the set on.
21   there I am. I look pissed.
22   I wave people off.
23   I /am/ bored.


24   how marvelous to be me without
25   trying.
26   it looks on tv
27   as if I knew exactly what I
28   was doing.


29   fooled them
30   again.

        Bukowski, Charles :  Sibelius and etc. [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   sick on a Friday night while the discos rock of ass
2   and hip and leg, I'm too sick to drink,
3   listening to Brahms and squeezing orange
4   juice. when I'm too sick to drink you
5   know I'm sick. I didn't even buy
6   tomorrow's Racing Form. now there's
7   some Sibelius on the radio and
8   in the apartment house on the
9   corner a woman screams as a
10   man beats her.


11   there's nothing on tv. it's moments like this that
12   the madhouses are better understood. I've even
13   rolled a joint now. I found some old stuff in
14   the closet.
15   when Sibelius reached 40 he shaved
16   all the hair on his head, walked
17   into his house and never
18   came out again until they
19   came for him.


20   sick at the age of 57 I sit listening to
21   the music and smoking this poor joint
22   while I plan a comeback.


23   sick on a Friday night I understand very little. but I
24   like the lamplight and my cigar box keeps saying over
25   and over to me: /mentel charutos pimentel charutos/
26   /pimentel charuto entel charutos pimentel charutos/
27   /pimen .../


28   the woman screams again as the man
29   beats her. he calls her a whore.
30   what is he doing living with
31   a whore?

        Bukowski, Charles :  the woman from Germany [from Dangling in
        the Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   every 3 or 4 nights the phone rings
2   and it's this woman from Germany.
3   she keeps her calls short:
4   "hello," she says, "it's me."
5   I never ask her name.
6   "what are you doing?" she asks.
7   "drinking white wine and typing," I
8   say.
9   "you always say that."
10   "that means that things are good."
11   "I've had some red wine. how are things with
12   you?"
13   "more bad affairs," I say, "they all end up
14   badly."
15   "mine too," she answers.
16   "it's sad, isn't it? I want to quit."
17   "I can't quit," she answers.
18   "good. I don't think I can either."
19   "I'm going to sleep now. goodnight."
20   "goodnight," I say.


21   and I can see her in her bedroom. I can see her
22   put the phone down. now she puts out the light.
23   she pulls the covers up, inhales and exhales deeply.
24   she is sad. her walls cover her. she is alone.
25   I want to know her name.

        Bukowski, Charles :  parked [from Dangling in the Tournefortia
        (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   sitting in my car
2   on Catalina Avenue in Redondo Beach
3   I see a fellow of 19 or 20
4   riding his bicycle on the sidewalk.
5   he wears sandals and blue shorts,
6   slows down, stops, puts one foot down,
7   sits upon his bicycle seat.
8   it is 4:30 in the afternoon and
9   he is tanned a deep and even tan,
10   has yellow hair and mustache.
11   his face is smooth
12   unmarked by pain or experience.
13   then something animates him
14   and he pedals off.


15   another crosses the street,
16   he must be 21,
17   very large of chest, blond,
18   blue-eyed, very tanned, wearing
19   green shorts and sandals.
20   it is a Tuesday afternoon.
21   he stands a moment
22   looking down the street.
23   his face is the same as the
24   other face:
25   without expression or purpose.
26   a long cigarette is in his mouth.
27   he finally enters a liquor store,
28   comes out a moment later
29   holding a can of Bubble-Up.


30   these are the kind that my parents wanted

[Page 206 ]


31   me to be
32   the kind my country wanted me to
33   be
34   the kind the girls wanted me to
35   be.


36   I start the engine and back out of
37   there
38   thinking about
39   Leo Durocher, Machine Gun Kelly,
40   Rocky Marciano, Two Ton Tony Galento
41   and Dutch Van Gogh.

1   typing in a room full of smoke
2   getting up
3   opening the door
4   going to the bathroom to piss
5   coming back
6   filling the glass
7   lighting a cigarette
8   typing again
9   poem number 6
10   poem number 7
11   getting drunker
12   what a floor show
13   a run of bombers murdering the natives
14   and the elephants
15   blasting huts and trees into storms of fire,
16   sitting in my shorts
17   balls hanging out of shorts,
18   finding wristwatch face-down in ashtray,
19   turning it,
20   looking:
21   only one-thirty a.m.,
22   time for another run
23   this time to blow away the whores of
24   rhyming poets,
25   first gotta piss once more
26   change the radio station
27   holler down the stairway to the woman:
28   "hey, baby, you all right?"

        Bukowski, Charles :  dummy [from Dangling in the Tournefortia
        (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]




1   we've lived together 3 or
2   4 years and I'm 23 years older than
3   she.


4   she takes me into the bathroom:
5   "look here. look at this. you've
6   made peepee on the floor again!"


7   "ah, come on ..."


8   " /admit/ it! you did it...!"


9   some time later she shows me
10   a bedsheet: "look, see that dark
11   mark? that's where you sat down!
12   that's /shit/ ! don't you wipe your
13   behind?"


14   "yeah ..."


15   "I don't think you do ..."


16   when I drive the car she says:
17   "what are you doing? you're going
18   in the wrong direction! and I don't
19   want to correct you, I /know/ how much
20   that upsets you ... but now you're
21   driving in second gear and you
22   should be driving in first! that's
23   not good for your car!"


24   when I stand in the bathroom shaving or

[Page 209 ]


25   just looking at my face and wondering,
26   she come in, grabs a deodorant stick
27   and begins rubbing it under my arms,
28   around my buttocks, behind my
29   neck.


30   "we want you to smell good ... remember
31   when I saw peanuts coming out of your
32   ass in bed? how do you explain that?"


33   "I told you how that happened ..."


34   "no, no, the peanuts were coming out
35   of your ass! how are you doing, peanut-
36   ass?"


37   "not so good, I guess ..."


38   "why don't you put the soap back in
39   the soap dish?"


40   "all right ..."

                    




41   when I first met her she said,
42   "you are my sage!"


43   but like I said that was 3 or
44   4 years ago.
45   and I always told her,
46   "I'm no sage."


47   now that's settled.


[Page 210 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  virgins [from Dangling in the Tournefortia
        (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   sitting in this little Mexican bar in San Pedro
2   Sunday afternoon, 5:30 p.m.
3   the walls are decorated with Indians in head dress
4   carrying virgins to sacrifice.
5   where did they find all these virgins?


6   the young man from the bar brings me another beer.
7   he is a nice boy, kind and caring, possibly
8   homosexual.


9   "how are you feeling?" he asks. "not so good,"
10   I say. "how so?" he asks.
11   I tap my head and smile: "it's the mind ..."
12   "oh," he says. "it's nothing," I say,
13   "a few more drinks will cure it ..."
14   "you drink," he says, "like a very thirsty man."
15   "I am," I say.


16   it's on afternoons like this that I should be
17   at the racetrack connecting with a $312 exacta.
18   not that the money matters
19   it's just nice to see something working right for a
20   moment
21   like a boa constrictor, like a tiger, like a paper clip.


22   there are new virgins this early evening
23   exploding across the surface
24   of the wall
25   crawling into the fireplaces
26   and coming out of my ears riding great white
27   horses
28   as I rise from the table with my shameful

[Page 211 ]


29   gut
30   the Mexican beer backed up like a
31   swamp of unsatisfactory days and
32   nights
33   I make it to the parking lot
34   let it go between two brilliantly waxed low-
35   riders in the moonlight.


36   now there's room for whiskey.


[Page 212 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  let nothing ever happen [from Dangling in
        the Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I drove in for gas and began filling my tank
2   and the attendant was a fat man dressed all in
3   orange.
4   he stood there watching and I had this feeling
5   that I should take the gas nozzle
6   jam it into his mouth
7   and fill him with about
8   five gallons of supreme.


9   I filled the tank instead
10   and hung up the hose.


11   I paid
12   got my change
13   and he watched me as I walked to the
14   front of my car
15   kicked the right front tire hard
16   circled the car
17   got in
18   and drove off.


19   I drove north down Pacific Coast Highway and it was all
20   right until I came to these orange
21   road-markers
22   which narrowed the three lanes down
23   to one.
24   traffic slowed
25   then stopped in a long line
26   for a red signal.
27   they had us all in the left
28   lane.

[Page 213 ]




29   I looked out the right window
30   and saw this blond road-worker with a
31   beard.


32   he tossed a road-marker through the air
33   to another road-worker with a beard.
34   he caught it
35   laughed and tossed it back.
36   they were playing catch.


37   hell, I remember when only hermits wore
38   beards.


39   the lane to the left wasn't moving and
40   I wanted to make a right turn
41   and there was nothing going on in the
42   other lanes
43   but this game of catch.


44   I cut into the right lane.
45   the blond boy saw me coming and
46   missed his catch.
47   as I drove past him he screamed,
48   "what the hell are you doing?"


49   I stopped my car and got out.
50   as I walked up to the blond the other
51   worker ran up.
52   he stopped in front of me.
53   "you can't drive in this lane,"
54   he said.


55   "what the hell are you doing?" asked
56   the blond.

[Page 214 ]




57   "if a cop was around he'd tag your
58   ass!" said the other boy.


59   "are you a cop?" I asked.


60   "no, you can see I'm not a cop."


61   "this is what the hell I am doing: I'm going to get into
62   my car and make a right turn from this lane."


63   "who the fuck do you think you are?" asked the
64   blond.


65   "I don't know who I am, but I'm going to get into
66   my car now and make a right turn from this lane."


67   "yeah," said the other boy, "you can eat shit too!"


68   "there's too much of it around here, I'm going to leave you
69   with it."


70   I got into my car
71   started it and
72   made my right turn.


73   I shouldn't have done that, I thought.
74   it's when you do things like that too often that
75   they put you in the madhouse.
76   maybe it's happening: this thing I've been
77   fighting against
78   so long.


79   I thought about driving back and
80   apologizing: "listen, fellows, I know I was wrong
81   and I've come back here to ask your forgiveness."

[Page 215 ]


82   or I could go back to the gas station man:
83   "listen, do you know that I was thinking of filling
84   you with five gallons of supreme and I'm here to
85   apologize for that."


86   but I just kept driving along.
87   if I was careful I could hide among all of them
88   for years.
89   as I stopped for a signal there were cars all
90   around me.
91   I turned my radio on loud
92   to the worst music I could
93   find.


[Page 216 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  the vampires [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I am hungover and in bed and the doorbell rings.
2   it is eleven a.m.
3   "what the /shit/ ?" I ask.
4   she goes to the door and I hear her talking.
5   she enters the bedroom and tells me,
6   "it's a Mr. Sanderson," she says, "he says you
7   know him and he wants to talk to you."
8   "Sanderson?" I ask, "what's his first name?"
9   she comes back with the answer: "he says his
10   first name is Frank."
11   "never heard of the son of a bitch. tell him
12   to get the hell out of here."
13   I hear them talking back and forth and
14   I consider all that very unnecessary and
15   I begin to get up and get dressed
16   to run him off.
17   when I get there he is gone.
18   "what did he want?" I ask.
19   "he wanted to talk to you," she says.
20   "well now, isn't that the cat's tit?"
21   "he looked like a very nice boy, he looked very sad
22   when you sent him off."
23   "I don't want to talk to any son of a bitch,"
24   I tell her.
25   "well, I would have talked to him," she says.


26   that night I am on my 4th or 5th beer when
27   there is a brutal knocking upon the door.
28   I figure murder, emergency, anything ...
29   somebody needs help ...
30   I open the door.
31   it is a fat son of a bitch and

[Page 217 ]


32   behind him are 5 or 6 other people
33   male and female.
34   "HEY!" screams the fat man, "I'M BO SEAVERS AND
35   WE'VE COME TO
36   SAY HELLO!"
37   I swing the door shut but he sticks a big shoe in there
38   holding it open.
39   "hold it," he says, "we're a lot alike, you'll really dig
40   me. many people mistake me for you."
41   "get your god damned foot out of the jamb," I say.
42   I take the heel of my shoe and crush it down
43   on his toes.
44   the foot withdraws and I slam the door.
45   ---after a moment beer cans and bottles hit against
46   the door, then a rock or two.
47   I hear some curses and then I hear them
48   walking off.


49   I sit down and open a new beer.
50   "ever since I was about 16," I tell her,
51   "people have been after me and it has never
52   stopped: 44 years worth of that.
53   I don't know what they want with me because,
54   you see, I most certainly dislike them."


55   "maybe if you'd just give them a chance,"
56   she says, "you'll find that everybody is an
57   individual if you'll just search them
58   out."


59   I drain my beer on that one,
60   then look at her:
61   "how the fuck did /you/ get in here?"


62   I walk into the kitchen and find the
63   scotch, unpeel it and pour a hit as

[Page 218 ]


64   the phone rings.
65   I hear her answer:
66   "who? I'll ask him ..."


67   I hear her walking toward me
68   in the kitchen
69   and I wonder why she doesn't already
70   know the answer
71   as I stand there holding the drink
72   watching the faucet leak
73   the way they do.


[Page 219 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  produced and bottled by ... [from Dangling
        in the Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   bleakly wandering flat white fields
2   listening for the sound of engines
3   my love is gone out another night.
4   she has needs. "you," she says,
5   "hate people. I like them ..."
6   she needs fresh air.
7   I feed the cats, bathe myself,
8   watch the telly.
9   she's stuck on this guy, died in 1969,
10   claimed he was God, came from
11   India, hung around Hollywood.
12   there is a photo of him in the bath-
13   room
14   we look at each other while I crap.


15   I begin thinking of old girlfriends
16   or of finding new ones
17   but that's so much work
18   and you get one
19   and she lasts for ten or fifteen
20   months
21   then skitters off into some new kind
22   of insanity.


23   and then too
24   you get to thinking
25   maybe it's yourself.
26   I certainly wouldn't like to
27   sit around with me
28   night after night ...


29   but one thing about drinking
30   about the bottle

[Page 220 ]


31   it might kill you
32   but it will kill you
33   with faithfulness
34   and sitting here with these
35   3 cats and this 1976 bottle
36   of Napa Valley red
37   I have to tell you,
38   faithfulness,
39   that's something rare.

        Bukowski, Charles :  retreat [from Dangling in the Tournefortia
        (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   well
2   if you didn't call for an enema
3   this is the A train to Norwalk,
4   and
5   the troops
6   will be brisking through here
7   soon
8   and you know
9   they ain't going to
10   leave the tits on a rat.


11   Thompson killed himself
12   last night
13   in his shining brass room
14   he drank silver paint
15   until his belly
16   came
17   out of his eyes.


18   remember the rule:
19   everything starts over at
20   each moment
21   and all that's past
22   is more useless
23   than what is
24   present.


25   we've raped
26   all the girls
27   40 times over.
28   we've left nothing

[Page 222 ]


29   for the enemy except
30   the residue
31   of our cowardice.


32   no matter ...
33   cowardice is the aftermath
34   of imagination.


35   shit, it's cold, though
36   you know
37   I imagine
38   death is not so bad
39   if the temperature
40   is decent.


41   but pain wearies me
42   it goes
43   on and on.
44   I think I've found
45   little methods
46   to escape it
47   and then it
48   shows me
49   the same thing
50   in a different
51   form.


52   hell,
53   I talk too much
54   we should
55   really
56   move out.
57   I see the flares
58   dropping now.
59   there's no use

[Page 223 ]


60   having another
61   meeting
62   of minds
63   there's nothing
64   left to solve.
65   the victorious
66   are getting ready
67   to arrive
68   and we've been
69   caught
70   out of place.


71   can't we
72   take back
73   move #45
74   and substitute
75   move #39?
76   that's the one
77   we should have
78   made.


79   well
80   let's go
81   give me your arm ...
82   oh, it's
83   gone ... you
84   motherfucker ...


85   you know
86   I can't believe
87   we've lost.
88   it didn't take
89   any effort
90   at all.
91   I guess the

[Page 224 ]


92   worst and best
93   things don't---
94   which leaves
95   the in
96   between and that
97   qualifies too.


98   careful,
99   the steps are
100   covered with
101   ice ...
102   I really like
103   your falcon tattoo ...


104   I don't know
105   where we're going
106   but
107   isn't it better
108   than having them
109   catch you
110   with your hand
111   around your
112   pecker?


113   let's sing
114   something,
115   huh?
116   how about a
117   love song?
118   I wish I knew
119   a hate song ...


120   you know
121   I was
122   eleven years old

[Page 225 ]


123   before I could whistle?


124   watch your
125   head
126   we're coming
127   out
128   and don't worry
129   I heard a
130   story once
131   that being killed
132   is the same as
133   killing ...


134   so all we have
135   to do
136   now
137   is
138   to
139   walk out of
140   here ...

        Bukowski, Charles :  the embracers [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I always meet these gregarious
2   females
3   who attend class at
4   night:
5   sculpting, ballet, acting and
6   etc.
7   and who are understanding
8   who embrace art and humanity
9   in almost all of its
10   shapes.


11   their phones are busy for
12   hours
13   their monthly phone bills are
14   unbelievable
15   they are chatting with new
16   girlfriends or old boyfriends
17   in Duluth, Pittsburgh and New Haven
18   or mothers and sisters in
19   Miami and Sacramento.


20   while I am at their place
21   an old boyfriend arrives
22   just a /friend/
23   and he sits on the rug
24   for a good stay and a
25   /chat/ .


26   well, he used to be
27   homosexual
28   went straight

[Page 227 ]


29   used to be a
30   drunkard
31   quit
32   used to take acid
33   speed and etc.
34   now clean
35   now going to get
36   married
37   now all right
38   and chitting and
39   jibbering away about
40   it
41   like a chimpanzee
42   like a hot nozzle douche.
43   we're invited to the
44   wedding and to a small
45   party afterwards
46   the real reception will
47   be a week after that
48   he's a gourmet
49   cook and it takes days to
50   prepare the food
51   and so it would be better
52   not to have /that/
53   reception right after the
54   wedding. he doesn't belong
55   to the same therapy group as
56   his future wife
57   she's into Scientology
58   but if people really /care/ ,
59   /fuck it/ , you know, they'd
60   both been through
61   plenty and they'd work it
62   out. and, and, and, and,
63   and, and.

[Page 228 ]




64   he leaves and I am told,
65   "that was Rodney, I've known
66   him for ten years. his father
67   died a few months ago and he
68   had to take over the family business.
69   it was a strain on him. I
70   don't think you've met his
71   girlfriend. she left her
72   piano at my place once and
73   there was kind of a mess
74   over that but I think she's
75   good for him ..."


76   I don't know what to say
77   to these gregarious women.
78   I lost my enthusiasm for
79   the masses at the age
80   of 4.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the cats too [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   your niece came and left
2   and your mother came and left
3   I outlived their problems
4   next I will rip up the cornstalks
5   in the garden,
6   maybe we can burn them in the fire-
7   place, ears and all, I have never
8   burned ears, have you?


9   the old folks next door are gone.
10   are they dead or visiting in
11   Kansas? when they die, you know
12   who's next? everybody. the
13   cats too, the cats too.


14   death or no, it's still nice to
15   live in the same place for two or
16   three years, no landlord banging.
17   one can get drunk and break the
18   windows, puke anywhere; one can
19   sing, scream, roll down the
20   stairway; one can step out on the
21   balcony and see all the way to
22   Long Beach.


23   it's all very literary.


24   the movie people come by, the
25   interviewers, the translators, the
26   editors, the publishers, the
27   suckerfish; we get them all drunk,
28   we get much drunker than they and

[Page 230 ]


29   we talk for hours, smoking our cigars,
30   swallowing their pills, smoking /their/
31   stuff, we talk until sunrise,
32   into the morning, pouring more drinks, coming out
33   of the kitchen with ever-new bottles, pulling out
34   the corks; I am two or three times their age; they
35   nod sleepily, they don't want to hear any more,
36   they wanted to hear about /creation/ , how it's done;
37   I never talk about that, it doesn't interest me, it
38   doesn't mean anything, only talking about playing
39   the horses means something, you see, it all revolves
40   around the horses, that's the secret, you want the
41   secret? that's the secret ...


42   oh? oh, yes, is ... that it?


43   they leave.


44   I wear them down. I make them hate. I give them
45   more than they want. they want to suck blood, I give
46   them pus. they leave.


47   they want to know, where can I get my stuff published,
48   some of them want to know that. and if you suggest a
49   place, they send their work with a note: "Chinaski
50   suggested that I send this to you ..."


51   it's all very literary.


52   if I, with this minor fame, am gutted with them what
53   does Truman Capote do?


54   here where the refrigerator works and the toilet
55   flushes and no Hindus prowl
56   the best way to forget the past is to live in the present
57   as if we deserved it, though we worry about the luck

[Page 231 ]


58   and also shell-shock and the brain-damaged de-
59   ranged past ... Children, have you read Alex Comfort,
60   Christopher Morley and Conrad Aiken?


61   anyhow, no landlord banging here now
62   one cat asleep in the car, another half-asleep
63   stuffed with horsemeat on top of the tv set
64   and the third out front being fractional with
65   the possums who live in the hedge.


66   my tax accountant phoned today and said not to
67   worry, he'd write the tax people in Frankfurt
68   and tell them that under the Double
69   Taxation Convention with the USA that I have
70   already sacrificed the runner to second.


71   where was this guy when I was trying to sleep
72   on that park bench in El Paso during the 1941
73   sandstorm? while half the world was burning?


74   it's 2:15 a.m. and you aren't drinking, I've
75   drunk almost all of it myself and there are two
76   bottles of beer left.
77   you are downstairs watching a space program
78   on tv and I won $147 at the track today,
79   clean line zinging here, only one landlord can
80   knock now---that mouldy parasite, he'll finally
81   collect
82   here where the succotash is fine and murder
83   episodes flower on our tv
84   I'll sleep soon after drinking those two
85   bottles of beer
86   I've finished writing this
87   it's literary history.

        Bukowski, Charles :  guava tree [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I lay with my white belly up to the sun under the pineapple
2   guava tree while other people's children are at school
3   any my woman is at work and it is quiet and I am alone with the
4   birds and I count eleven of them on the wire overhead
5   and there's nothing to do here.
6   before there was always much for me to do
7   but it was always the other man's idea
8   the other man who was making all the money using me
9   and also the foreman he hired to cause me trouble
10   we were pitted against each other and that just wasn't
11   sensible because he was almost as poor as I, it was
12   tiring and deathly like something sucking at
13   your blood.
14   well, I wasn't a revolutionary, I only wanted to save
15   my own ass, I figured that would be easier than saving
16   humanity's ass ...


17   now under the pineapple guava tree I am still sucking at
18   the free hours
19   I can never suck enough free hours, blinking at the
20   sun, scratching my nose, nowhere to go and nothing to do
21   glorious
22   the boys would never guess how I did it and I hardly know
23   myself
24   but I knew in the factories, I knew in those places that
25   I wanted out, my eye always on the window, the doorway,
26   and the workers liked me because they thought I was crazy
27   and the foremen were puzzled because I worked hard
28   but with disdain.


29   now under the pineapple guava tree, the sun cutting through
30   the branches, I still have the body of a young boy

[Page 233 ]


31   but the face is old
32   remembering the hours and the places and what was done
33   to the days and the weeks and the years.


34   I turn on my belly, spread both arms wide feeling like
35   the wolf who got out of the trap but without gnawing a
36   leg away.
37   they got something, of course, that's why I'm still
38   resting, but it's the parts that are left that I'm
39   celebrating under this pineapple guava tree just
40   before noon.

        Bukowski, Charles :  getting my money's worth [from Dangling in
        the Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the water was cold and filled with bits of seaweed
2   it looked strangely like little pieces of broken shit
3   and nobody went into the water
4   and I told her,
5   "I'm gong in. we drove one hundred and seventy miles
6   to get here and we are paying $30 a night for a motel room
7   with a shower stall built for people 4 feet tall. I'm
8   going in."
9   "not me," she said.
10   I left her on her STAR WARS towel
11   I entered the water
12   small hard rocks underfoot
13   I walked in chilled
14   reaching down and splashing myself.
15   then the first wave came and I dove under
16   I could feel the seaweed clinging to me
17   it had been a great hurricane
18   the best of the year
19   as I stood up an unbroken mass of seaweed wound
20   around me.
21   I broke from the tendrils
22   turned and waved to her on the shore
23   beckoning---
24   "come on in, chickenshit ..."
25   I turned in time to dive under the new
26   breaker
27   then I swam for ten or fifteen yards
28   parallel to the shore.
29   I turned again and waved her in---
30   "come on, show some guts!"
31   she waved me off---
32   "go on, be an asshole! not me!"

[Page 235 ]




33   I leaped high
34   breaking through and over the next wave.
35   Del Mar was a fine place
36   even though the racetrack was unlucky for me.
37   as I settled down upon the ocean bottom
38   my left foot stepped on something soft
39   which appeared to be alive.
40   I leaped away
41   falling backwards into the water
42   and the next wave passed over me.
43   I rolled over and was carried toward the shore.
44   I got up and walked through the broken seaweed
45   pulling my trunks up.
46   I walked over the rocks and onto the shore
47   then up on the sand.
48   "you didn't stay very long," she said.
49   "I stepped on something out there, it was
50   alive. I got the fuck out."
51   "dry off and lay down," she said.
52   "I'm going to shower. I've got to make the first
53   race."
54   "o.k.," she said, "I'll see you about the 5th.
55   I want to get some sun."


56   I walked back to the motel and got under the
57   4-foot shower. what had I stepped on? a dead
58   fish? an eel?
59   I got out and dried off, selected my short-
60   sleeved blue shirt
61   tan pants
62   loafers
63   green bikini underwear.


64   the good life of the California
65   sportsman.


[Page 236 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  guest [from Dangling in the Tournefortia
        (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   we got drunk
2   and then he started,
3   he said, listen, I know that
4   people claim you're uneducated
5   and unread
6   but here we've been talking about
7   /The Red and the Black./
8   you know that Lorca was gunned down
9   in a Spanish road.
10   you've mentioned many painters
11   and I know that you know
12   the great musicians.
13   you know who wrote /The Cherry/
14   /Orchard./
15   you know that Ambrose Bierce was
16   killed by Mexican bandits.
17   and you know who wrote /The Devil's/
18   /Dictionary./
19   you know who whipped Hemingway's
20   ass and that Gertrude Stein had a
21   wooden leg.
22   you know of the one who went mad
23   in a rowboat.
24   you know who died of syphilis.
25   and you know that Anton Chekov
26   shot his dog. pardon me ...


27   he got up, went into the bathroom.
28   I could hear him puking.


29   then he walked out, sat on the couch,
30   lit his pipe, took a hit on his beer
31   can, put it down and passed out quietly,

[Page 237 ]


32   sitting there, his head dropping
33   just a bit.


34   she came down the stairway.
35   is he all right?


36   he's all right. he's staying
37   tonight, I think.


38   I'm sorry I left but I couldn't
39   listen anymore, he just kept
40   talking.


41   it's all right, I said.


42   I turned off the lights and went up the
43   stairway with her.


44   it's pitiful, she said, he /adores/
45   you.


46   he thinks I'm a genius, I
47   said.


48   are you? she asked as we got to
49   the bedroom.


50   I will be if I can get rid of
51   him.


52   we stood there getting undressed.


53   have you brushed your teeth?
54   she asked.


55   many times, I answered.

[Page 238 ]




56   then I got into bed, fast.
57   I was better at getting into bed
58   than anybody that I knew.


59   then she climbed in:
60   is your friend downstairs going to
61   be all right?


62   he'll make it through the night and he'll
63   return, I told her.


64   some things you sleep away.
65   and I decided to do just that and
66   as we faced away
67   I moved my feet to the backs
68   of her calves
69   while half a block down
70   the dogs of night
71   barked about nothing.


[Page 239 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  war [from Dangling in the Tournefortia
        (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the black and the yellow met
2   at the bottom of the hill.
3   the black stopped dead by the crash
4   and the yellow veering away from the
5   black
6   and coming directly at me with
7   the driver slumped over the wheel.
8   I should put my car in reverse,
9   I thought, but my hand didn't move
10   on the gearshift.
11   then the yellow slanted off
12   and I thought, it's not going to hit
13   me squarely, it's going to scrape the
14   side, and then it passed my right side
15   silently,
16   you couldn't have slipped a sheet of paper
17   between us.
18   then the yellow crashed head-on into the
19   car of a man braked to my right two
20   car lengths back.
21   the yellow pushed him back, bounced off,
22   slanted crazily behind my car, crossed the
23   street, ran into a curbing and was still.


24   I had not seen the initial crash
25   I had only heard it.
26   I circled into a gas station
27   and sat there
28   looking at the three crushed silent cars.


29   if I had put it in reverse,
30   I would have been there too.
31   I started the engine and drove

[Page 240 ]


32   out thinking, let's see? where was I
33   going. oh yes, the post office.
34   I need stamps.


35   I hit the classical music button
36   on the car radio.


[Page 241 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  table for two [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   it was down at the waterfront and we
2   waited at the bar for a table.


3   they sure don't make bartenders like
4   they used to make them
5   this one looked like a piece of silk
6   tacked over a doorway leading
7   nowhere.


8   he kept leaning toward a girl at the
9   bar.
10   the girl was built like a machine gun
11   tower out of World War I.
12   she spit some tracer bullets out of
13   her mouth:
14   "you ain't gettin' my fuckin' pussy
15   you snake-brained turd!"


16   it was then that the bartender noticed
17   us staring
18   behind the bar at
19   the many lovely bottles.
20   so he came over and said, "good
21   evening," and we ordered and he
22   walked off with his tiny precious
23   Mick Jagger ass.


24   my girlfriend looked out at the harbor
25   view: "look at those boats out there,"
26   she said. "I wish we had a boat."
27   "yeah," I said.


28   the bartender sliced back into view.

[Page 242 ]




29   I noticed the tiny seaweed earring in
30   his left ear as he proceeded to set the
31   drinks down sloshing away
32   one-fourth of each.
33   then he reached for a dirty rag and
34   wiped the dry area around the edges
35   of the puddles.
36   "that bitch down there," he nodded toward
37   her, "she thinks she's hot shit!"
38   I told him, "I think she looks like a
39   machine gun tower out of World War I."
40   the bartender said, "oh, that's /good/ !
41   I'm going to tell her that!"


42   so he walked down and told the lady
43   and she turned and looked at me.
44   she said, "hey, buddy! fuck you!"
45   I nodded my head at her
46   not quite knowing why.


47   "hey," said my girlfriend, "are you
48   coming on to her?"


49   "no," I
50   said.


51   "god damn," she said, "sometimes I
52   think you're just some kind of fuck-
53   twist!"


54   "what do you mean by that?" I asked.


55   "oh shit," she said, "forget it."


56   I motioned for a couple more drinks.
57   the bartender came on down.

[Page 243 ]




58   "I told her what you said," he
59   said.


60   "we'll have two more," I
61   told him.


62   "what were they?" he asked.


63   "check the puddles," I pointed to
64   the bar, "we'll have the same."


65   the woman down at the bar looked
66   at me again: "fuck you, buddy!"


67   I got up and found the men's
68   room.
69   as I stood at the urinal
70   gagging and pissing
71   a crapper door opened and a
72   midget walked out.
73   he took an orange tennis ball
74   out of his pocket.
75   he cocked his arm and threw a
76   line drive at the mirror.
77   the mirror didn't break.
78   and as the ball zipped back
79   he leaped into the air and caught
80   it in his mouth.
81   then, while holding the ball in
82   his mouth
83   he did a little tap dance like
84   Fred Astaire and
85   was gone.


86   I walked back to the bar and sat
87   down next to my girlfriend:

[Page 244 ]




88   "I don't want to eat here. let's
89   go."


90   "but the view's great!" she said.
91   "we can sit at a table and watch the
92   boats going in and out."


93   I threw some bills down on the
94   bar.
95   "no, let's go, to hell with it."


96   "nothing ever quite works for
97   you, does it?" she asked.


98   "no," I answered.


99   I got up and she followed me.


100   as we passed the lady at the
101   bar she said, "fuck you, buddy!"


102   I was about to open the door
103   when somebody pushed the door from
104   the outside.
105   the door opened in and I threw
106   up my forearm as the door slammed
107   into it.
108   the man who had opened the door had
109   a head like a pumpkin and he was with
110   a woman whose face looked like a seal's
111   face and she had on a little hat
112   only the little hat looked like a large
113   wristwatch had been fastened to the top of it.


114   "oh," said the man, "terribly sorry!"

[Page 245 ]




115   as we walked into the night the man
116   held the door open and the lady with the
117   wristwatch on her hat kept looking at
118   me as if she couldn't believe that the door
119   had actually hit me on the
120   forearm.


121   we walked out into the parking lot and
122   suddenly
123   I don't know why
124   I had to piss again and I unzipped and
125   stood between two cars
126   one was black and large and the other was
127   green and medium-sized.
128   I decided to let it go on the green
129   one.


130   "someday you are going to get caught
131   doing that," said my girlfriend.


132   "oh yes," I said, "I'm sure that I
133   will."


[Page 246 ]

1   pissing drunk
2   in the middle of the night
3   on the second floor of somewhere
4   symphony music on---
5   quite a good boy working out.


6   it's good to have the arts
7   to let it go on.


8   I flush.
9   shake it.
10   wash my hands.


11   the symphony music is exceptional---
12   large emotional cartwheels
13   of glory.


14   it's good to have the arts
15   to let it go on.


16   suppose we didn't have that
17   to let it go on?
18   we'd jump off buildings or
19   murder our lovers.


20   I go naked down the stairway.
21   she is there watching an old movie on tv.


22   "you ought to put something on,"
23   she says,
24   "you'll catch cold."


25   you see, it's nice that we have

[Page 247 ]


26   somebody who doesn't want us
27   to get sick,
28   and also after pissing in the
29   middle of the night it's nice
30   to be recognized.


31   "how long you going to stay up?"
32   you ask her.


33   "this thing is terrible," she says,
34   "but I have to find out
35   how it ends."


36   I go into the kitchen
37   open the refrigerator and
38   stare inside.
39   I don't know what I want there
40   somehow it looks more like a
41   clothes closet.


42   I close the refrigerator door
43   admire the fat click
44   it makes
45   then I go to the stairway
46   walk up.


47   pissing
48   can be
49   quite an
50   adventure.

        Bukowski, Charles :  notes upon a hot streak: [from Dangling in
        the Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I have been driving to the racetrack
2   for thirty years now
3   in some of the worst junk cars
4   imaginable.
5   I have outlived most of the parking lot
6   attendants
7   but now as I drive up in a new BMW
8   some of them remember me from the
9   old days
10   " /hey, champ/ ," they say, " /how's it/
11   /going?/ "
12   "it's going good," I tell them.
13   " /got a good one for me, champ?/ "
14   they ask
15   I wink and drive on in.


16   they think I am making it at the
17   races, they think I have solved the
18   ponies.


19   /"hey, champ, who was that young girl/
20   /you were with the other day?"/


21   I drive on in.


22   I play the horses like other men
23   play chess:
24   make the proper moves and make
25   them well.
26   and lately, after all these years,
27   I have begun to win and I leave
28   with little bundles of money each
29   day.

[Page 249 ]




30   it's a very odd feeling
31   but I accept it,
32   use valet parking
33   to the clubhouse.


34   it is a lovable comedy:
35   both the writing and the
36   betting:
37   they are letting me win
38   for this moment.


39   but the attendants seem to think
40   that I know some secret:
41   /"you're looking good, champ,/
42   /just give me one good one and/
43   /I won't bother you anymore!"/


44   I smile and drive on in.


[Page 250 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  do you use a notebook? [from Dangling in
        the Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]




1   many a time when I drive this black beauty out of the driveway
2   of my home, drive down the hill, turn right at the signal,
3   wait, take a left, run down 3 blocks take another left, go
4   another 2 blocks and I'm onto the freeway
5   many a time I think,
6   what am I doing here?
7   why am I in this car?
8   where am I supposed to be?---
9   going to the racetrack at 11 a.m. while other men are working
10   I turn on the radio and light a cigarette.
11   what am I doing with this leisure?
12   where did the factories go?
13   and the whores?
14   and the drunktanks?


15   then
16   such thoughts pass
17   and I begin to think about my new system, it's going quite
18   well---it's most interesting how just 3 numbers
19   balanced against each horse selects the winner about
20   40% of the time.


21   ... and then the thoughts mix as I cut between a tanker and
22   a Volks: when the interviewers come by they want to know
23   about writing---
24   what are your influences?
25   do you use a notebook?
26   do you revise?
27   why do you write?


28   ... and I begin talking about the horses and my system and
29   everybody looks discouraged, including the lady I live with.

[Page 251 ]




30   "he always talks like this," she tells them.

                    




31   I drive the black beauty toward the track, opening the
32   automatic roof for more sunshine.


33   they don't understand---it's been a gamble all along;
34   nothing ever solidifies into a sure thing; all gifts
35   must constantly be earned and re-earned; also, to linger
36   incessantly upon the ground of literature and learning
37   is not only inhuman, it's dumb.


38   ... driving into the track I stop to pay the parking lot
39   attendant.
40   he knows me: "how's it going, champ?"
41   "just trying to make it," I tell him.


42   I drive toward preferred parking, valet's no good:
43   they burn the cold engines out returning the machines to
44   the people after the 9th race.


45   I park between a Dodge van and a Volks Rabbit
46   thinking, Ernie would have understood and surely,
47   Manolete, and certainly all the people here ahead of me,
48   already parked and in there waiting, getting
49   ready.


50   I step out, lock the car and walk toward the gate,
51   it is a meaningful and beautiful day, and knowing
52   the terror, the luck and the grace, I move
53   deliberately toward the action,
54   the mountains up there like that
55   listening to my footsteps as I walk on in.


[Page 252 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  smooth [from Dangling in the Tournefortia
        (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   slowly driving the back streets of the town, looking at
2   old houses, garbage cans, fences ... in decay;
3   driving through the warehouse district,
4   then running the car down to the harbor, parking,
5   getting out, getting a coffee at a stand,
6   then sitting at a table watching ships as long as
7   a city block going out to sea, thinking of all the women
8   now gone and how important each one had seemed
9   of enormous importance
10   an importance bigger than any of the ships
11   and now they were elsewhere with other men
12   or alone.
13   getting up, back to the car, driving to the market
14   to get oranges and wine, radishes, green onions, toilet
15   paper,
16   looking at the people who had once seemed so dangerous,
17   now they were listless, pushing their carts,
18   no arguments, no trouble, no impatience.
19   even the racetracks were closed because of a special
20   holiday.
21   getting into the car with the goods
22   driving the back streets
23   there are children playing some game,
24   they step back to let the car through;
25   no curses, no rocks thrown, silence,
26   afternoon into evening, an effortless evolving;
27   no ambulances, not even a dead dog in the street.


28   it's going to be a bad night,
29   I'm going to be mean to my woman and it's not going to be
30   her fault.

        Bukowski, Charles :  message [from Dangling in the Tournefortia
        (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I've been sitting in this
2   room for hours
3   typing, and drinking
4   red wine.


5   I thought I was
6   alone here.
7   the door is closed and
8   the window.


9   now a big fat fly
10   ugly and black
11   sits on the edge
12   of my wine glass.


13   where did it come
14   from?
15   so silent, motionless
16   like that.


17   that's the way
18   it might be
19   with death.


[Page 254 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  they ruin your day [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I parked the BMW and went in to get some papers
2   xeroxed.
3   I watched the white sheets of paper jump out of
4   the machine.
5   it was a warm and easy day.
6   I clipped the papers together
7   paid the clerk and walked out on the street again.


8   and here he came in seaman's cap
9   blue work shirt and pants rolled too high.


10   there were others but he walked right up to me
11   grabbed my hand and began shaking it:
12   "hey, buddy, urgworg buddy lapu ssot udorob
13   I am your brother sag Ilah worg ..."


14   "you're breaking my hand," I told
15   him.


16   I reached into my pocket and gave him a
17   quarter.


18   "wrogssarg buddy ssamniknat, you yremaerc ..."
19   I walked on but he shouted after me: "ecin
20   wolley yemttrid ereth ..."


21   I never liked such situations because I felt like
22   a fool if I gave up the money and I felt like a
23   bastard if I didn't.
24   and no matter what I did or didn't do
25   it just didn't go away for a while.

[Page 255 ]




26   I walked to my car
27   unlocked it
28   got in and sat there.
29   some girls were coming out of a cafe after lunch.
30   they were going back to work
31   a whole group of them chatting and walking along
32   and I stared hard at their breasts and their legs
33   and their behinds
34   but it didn't help.


35   I started the car and drove down 6th to Pacific.
36   I crossed Pacific and went all the way to Gaffey
37   and it wasn't until I turned off Gaffey and
38   on to 3rd and saw a boy on a lawn holding a dog
39   while another boy strangled the dog with a rubber
40   hose
41   that I forgot about that bum at all.


[Page 256 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  order [from Dangling in the Tournefortia
        (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]

29   the garbage in this room filled an
30   entire trash can


31   I look about
32   all this space
33   this cleanliness


34   it's nice
35   here


36   but I can't
37   write
38   I can't
39   write
40   I CAN'T
41   WRITE


42   and I think of Lenny
43   Bruce's immortal line:
44   I CAN'T
45   COME


46   now I sit in this
47   place
48   and
49   I can't
50   write
51   and
52   I can't
53   come
54   either.

        Bukowski, Charles :  my big fling [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   it was a bad night
2   one of those
3   where all the talk
4   only makes it worse,
5   uglier and uglier.
6   I was never one
7   who cared much for
8   "discussion"
9   anyhow
10   so I slammed the
11   door
12   got into my car
13   and then I was
14   on the freeway
15   radio on
16   driving north
17   into the big town.
18   I still knew a
19   few girls
20   from the past.


21   I got a motel room
22   on Sunset Boulevard
23   opened the bottle
24   had a drink
25   undressed
26   took a shower
27   came out
28   turned on the black
29   and white tv
30   laid on the bed
31   and had another drink.

[Page 259 ]




32   then something came to
33   me,
34   I knew that any woman
35   an old girl friend
36   or a new one
37   only meant more of
38   what I had just gotten away
39   from.


40   I didn't turn on the
41   lights, it felt good
42   in that dark room,
43   it was quiet, far away
44   from war
45   of any sort.


46   I stayed on the bed
47   and watched tv.
48   I had never cared much
49   for tv
50   but watching
51   all those people
52   with all their desires
53   and all their troubles
54   amused me.


55   I watched and I had
56   two bottles and I finished
57   one and I started the other
58   and I watched tv.
59   I felt like a boy who had
60   run away from home and
61   had found
62   his first room.


63   when the second bottle was

[Page 260 ]


64   emptied
65   I slept.


66   when I got back
67   at noon
68   the next day
69   I didn't expect her
70   to ask me if I had been
71   fucked
72   and she didn't.
73   also, I didn't ask
74   her and I didn't care.


75   she was quiet.
76   the screaming was
77   over.


78   and two or three days
79   later
80   talking easily about
81   it
82   we found out
83   we had watched the same
84   tv programs,
85   the only thing was
86   she said she didn't like
87   them
88   and I said
89   I did.


90   and we left it
91   like that.


[Page 261 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  contemporary literature, one [from Dangling
        in the Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]




1   I got drunk once and told
2   her about it.
3   how I had lived in a
4   paper shack in Atlanta
5   $1.25 a week rent
6   no light
7   no water
8   no toilet
9   no heat


10   nothing in my
11   pockets
12   not even a
13   penny


14   it was freezing


15   no friends


16   parents 3,000
17   miles away
18   who refused to
19   send money


20   only a six-page
21   letter from my
22   father
23   reminding me of
24   my failures
25   of my refusal
26   to face
27   reality

[Page 262 ]


28   of my stupidity
29   for wanting to
30   be a writer.


31   all my manuscripts
32   returned from the
33   magazines


34   once weighing
35   198 pounds I now
36   weighed 133


37   there was a wire
38   which dangled over-
39   head
40   a wire which had
41   once fed a
42   lightbulb


43   I reached for that
44   wire
45   not knowing
46   whether it was alive
47   or dead


48   I waved my hand
49   near it
50   closer and
51   closer


52   then I stopped


53   I saw some newspapers
54   on the floor


55   I was out of writing

[Page 263 ]


56   paper
57   had long ago hocked
58   my typewriter


59   I noticed that
60   each page of the
61   newspaper had a wide white
62   margin around the
63   edge


64   I had a pencil
65   stub


66   I picked up a
67   newspaper and with
68   the pencil stub
69   I began to write
70   words
71   on the edge


72   sitting in the doorway
73   freezing in the moonlight
74   so that I could
75   see
76   I wrote in pencil
77   on all the edges
78   of all the newspapers
79   in that shack.

                    




80   I got drunk
81   one night
82   and told her
83   about that shack

[Page 264 ]


84   again


85   and she said,
86   "I've heard that
87   story before."


88   then she climbed into
89   the new $10,000 Fiat
90   I had given her
91   for her birthday
92   and drove down to
93   the corner
94   market
95   to shop for our
96   dinner
97   that night.


[Page 265 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  the film makers [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I can't shoot pool, don't want
2   to, am told by people I know
3   that certain movies are great,
4   and I attend these movies
5   feeling low-
6   down
7   sitting there in a seat
8   among the lonely and
9   insufficient people,
10   and the screen flashes
11   its genius
12   only it's not there
13   it misses as it has
14   almost always missed---
15   millions of dollars
16   pissed away.
17   the people are so used
18   to being conned
19   they get gross mixed up
20   with great.


21   it's easy to bitch, I
22   guess most do
23   about the wrong things.
24   but about the movies
25   I can't help saying
26   now and then,
27   why don't you stop
28   this?


29   but maybe /they/ don't
30   even know.

[Page 266 ]




31   maybe the creators of films
32   and the public are
33   alike.


34   I don't even want
35   to go on
36   about it.
37   it's raining tonight
38   and I've just opened the door
39   and spots of wet
40   are coming in,
41   probably
42   radioactive.


43   when I was a boy
44   we used to play
45   King of the Hill.


46   "hey, I'm King of
47   the Hill! Come get
48   me!"


49   now there isn't even
50   a hill.


51   the other night
52   this Italian film crew
53   came around.
54   "hey, look we got an
55   idea. we'll film you
56   shooting a game of
57   pool in some
58   dive!"


59   I told them to get

[Page 267 ]


60   their cameras out
61   and to go along
62   with them.


63   in this palace---
64   the earth---
65   pigs shit in
66   golden bathrooms
67   and the deaths
68   of fools
69   are followed by
70   motorcades
71   six blocks long.


72   I've closed the
73   door
74   now.
75   the rain is
76   no longer coming
77   in.


78   the bastards
79   left behind
80   a piece of
81   equipment.
82   which means that
83   they'll be
84   back.


85   people who hang around
86   celluloid
87   usually
88   are.

        Bukowski, Charles :  slow night [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the
2   /Côte de Nuits-Villages Louis/
3   /Jadot/ is gone
4   but there is
5   some /San Martin Petite Sirah/
6   1976.
7   now that was a hell of a year
8   wasn't it?
9   but 1936 and 1926
10   1946 and 1956
11   weren't much.


12   1980?
13   I sit in a room
14   conscious of my elbows
15   and my wrists
16   typing naked at
17   11:17 p.m.


18   my father's big ugly flapping
19   ears have been dead for some
20   time now.
21   he used to beat me with that unbelievable razor strop
22   three or four times a week
23   in the bathroom also used to
24   shit in, shave in, bathe in.


25   my father was created by
26   forces he couldn't defeat;
27   he even failed to break me,
28   and you know how that must have made him
29   feel;

[Page 269 ]


30   the poor fellow became
31   unhappier and unhappier,
32   his unhappiness grew narrow
33   while my misery grew
34   immense.


35   tonight I think of him,
36   February 5, 1980,
37   how I gave it up
38   surrendered to the magic of
39   the word---
40   no woman as beautiful,
41   no greater wealth:
42   without knowing what he did
43   my father moulded whatever
44   artist there is in
45   me.


46   it's time to stop,
47   too much red wine,
48   cigarette ash upon the white belly
49   nicotine-browned fingers typing
50   I am grinning
51   I am a religion with a new god
52   my father has been dead for
53   some time
54   and you are what is
55   killing me
56   now.

        in the Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I still get letters in the mail, mostly from cracked-up
2   men in tiny rooms with factory jobs or no jobs who are
3   living with whores or no woman at all, no hope, just
4   booze and madness.
5   Most of their letters are on lined paper
6   written with an unsharpened pencil
7   or in ink
8   in tiny handwriting that slants to the
9   left
10   and the paper is often torn
11   usually halfway up the middle
12   and they say they like my stuff,
13   I've written from where it's at, and
14   they recognize that. truly, I've given them a second
15   chance, some recognition of where they're at.


16   it's true, I was there, worse off than most
17   of them.
18   but I wonder if they realize where their letters
19   arrive?
20   well, they are dropped into a box
21   behind a six-foot hedge with a long driveway leading
22   to a two car garage, rose garden, fruit trees,
23   animals, a beautiful woman, mortgage about half
24   paid after a year, a new car,
25   fireplace and a green rug two-inches thick
26   with a young boy to write my stuff now,
27   I keep him in a ten-foot cage with a
28   typewriter, feed him whiskey and raw whores,
29   belt him pretty good three or four times
30   a week.
31   I'm 59 years old now and the critics say
32   my stuff is getting better than ever.

        Bukowski, Charles :  too late [from Dangling in the Tournefortia
        (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   about to walk into a supermarket today
2   here came an old woman dressed in floppy
3   white, must have been sixty-eight, knobby
4   knees, tits all gone, hair shot to hell in the
5   wind, she had something in mind, banging
6   along with her shopping cart full of
7   sundries, she arched her brows together
8   tightly above her nose and drove her
9   gondola of goodies right into me /hard/ ,
10   the bottom of the cart cracking my legs
11   just above the ankles, "shit," I said
12   and she backed off and as the long
13   ash of her cigarette fell to the pavement
14   she gave me a half-grin, swerved her
15   rushing chariot around and I knew that
16   she knew that I knew that one day at one
17   time her legs her kneecaps her glance her
18   every word kept men suspended between dream and
19   reality---that once she knew how to hold a
20   telephone or fix a braid just so, now,
21   christ, she banged me
22   we could have met that night in Atlanta,
23   Georgia when the wallpaper got as close
24   as my fingernails
25   now, she didn't care at all and I cared
26   a little bit less
27   stepping inside the automatic doors and
28   walking toward the line of shopping
29   carts, I'm sixty, dear, what the
30   hell.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the poets and the foreman [from Dangling in
        the Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]




1   the best of Auden
2   the best of Jeffers
3   lines laid down
4   neatly
5   dried blood
6   crisp on the page
7   in that
8   cheap room of
9   peeling wallpaper
10   and the shadows of
11   drab men
12   who had died
13   there


14   the best of Auden
15   the best of Jeffers
16   you could walk down
17   the hall to the
18   crapper
19   conscious
20   at least of the
21   fingernails on
22   your hands


23   you could go back
24   to the bad
25   wine
26   and no woman
27   and not much of a
28   job in the
29   morning

[Page 273 ]




30   the best of Auden
31   the best of Jeffers
32   they helped
33   immensely.


34   drunk upon
35   wine and the reading
36   of them
37   getting into bed
38   there
39   it was steady
40   it held


41   as the mice came
42   out in the dark
43   and claimed that
44   in the unknown
45   city

                    




46   to awaken
47   having forgotten
48   the best of Auden and
49   Jeffers


50   first the thick bland syrup
51   on hotcakes
52   then going in to the
53   bald fat foreman
54   with dim eyes
55   who owned your prong
56   and your asshole and
57   your nostril hairs

[Page 274 ]




58   you remembered and wondered
59   about Auden and Jeffers
60   then


61   the foreman
62   was a very hard and knowledgeable
63   guide


64   he had his own book
65   you read his
66   book


67   and after a while
68   you got to like him
69   too


70   his lines
71   too
72   were blood crisp


73   now I've gotten rid
74   of Auden and Jeffers and
75   the foreman


76   and to be alone
77   like this
78   is the way
79   of course


80   I really don't miss
81   the foreman


82   and there's nothing
83   left to read
84   anymore

[Page 275 ]




85   lately I just read
86   the daily newspaper
87   over and over
88   again


89   look out across this
90   place
91   where some call me
92   famous
93   where some call me
94   a great writer
95   and I know that nothing
96   means very much
97   just as I had suspected
98   in the
99   beginning.

        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   she's downstairs singing, playing her
2   guitar, I think she's happier than
3   usual and I'm glad. sometimes my
4   mind gets sick and I'm cruel to her.
5   she weighs one hundred and one
6   pounds
7   has small wrists and
8   her eyes
9   are often purely sad.


10   sometimes my needs
11   make me selfish
12   a backwash floods my
13   mind
14   and I've never been
15   good
16   with apology.


17   I hear her singing
18   now it's
19   very late night
20   and from here
21   I can see the
22   lights of the city
23   and they are sweet as
24   ripe garden fruits
25   and this room is
26   calm
27   so strange
28   as if magic had
29   become normal.

        Bukowski, Charles :  we evolve [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   at first it seems like fucking is the big thing,
2   then after that---social consciousness,
3   then intellectual accomplishment,
4   and then after that
5   some fall into religion
6   others into the arts.
7   after that begins the gathering of money
8   and after the gathering of money
9   the stage where we pretend that
10   money doesn't matter.
11   then it's health and hobbies,
12   travel, and finally just sitting around
13   thinking vaguely of vague things,
14   rooting in gardens
15   hating flies, noise, bad weather, snails,
16   rudeness, the unexpected, new neighbors,
17   old friends, drunks, smoking, fucking,
18   singing, dancing, upstarts,
19   the postman and weeds.
20   it gives one the fidgets: waiting on
21   death.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the man at the piano [from Dangling in the
        Tournefortia (1981) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the man at the piano
2   plays a song
3   he didn't write
4   sings words
5   that aren't his
6   upon a piano
7   he doesn't own


8   while
9   people at tables
10   eat, drink and talk


11   the man at the piano
12   finishes
13   to no applause


14   then
15   begins to play
16   a new song
17   he didn't write
18   begins to sing
19   words
20   that aren't his
21   upon a piano
22   that isn't his


23   as the
24   people at the tables
25   continue to
26   eat, drink and talk


27   when

[Page 279 ]


28   he finishes
29   to no applause
30   he announces
31   over the mike
32   that he is
33   going to take
34   a ten-minute break


35   he goes
36   back to the men's
37   room
38   enters
39   a toilet booth
40   bolts the door
41   sits down
42   pulls out a joint
43   lights up


44   he's glad
45   he's not
46   at the piano


47   and the
48   people at the tables
49   eating, drinking and talking
50   are glad
51   he isn't there
52   either


53   this is
54   the way it goes
55   almost everywhere
56   with everybody and
57   everything
58   as fiercely
59   in the highlands

[Page 280 ]


60   the
61   black swan burns.

1   my cat
2   leaped
3   into the fireplace
4   burning
5   as Van Gogh
6   slit
7   the rear screen
8   and entered
9   looking
10   for
11   the blue whore
12   of nowhere.

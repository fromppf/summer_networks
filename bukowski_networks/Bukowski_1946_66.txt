        Preface

Grateful acknowledgement is given to the editors of the scores of
literary magazines and chapbooks where many of these poems originally
appeared. Thanks also to Chris Brun, Special Collections Librarian at
the University of California, Santa Barbara for his cooperation. And
finally, thanks to Michael J. Sherick for his assistance in locating
these texts.

        /Foreword/

A question put to me quite often is, "Why do your out-of-print books
cost so much?" Well, they cost so much because that's what booksellers
can get for them from collectors.

"I want to read your early poems but ..."

I don't even have some of my early books. Most of them were stolen by
people I drank with. When I'd go to the bathroom, they did /their/ shit.
It only reinforced my general opinion of humanity. And caused me to
drink with fewer people.

At first, I made efforts to replace these books, and did, but when they
were stolen all over again I stopped the replacement process and more
and more drank alone.

Anyhow, what follows are what we consider to be the best of the early
poems. Some are taken from the first few books; others were not in books
but have been taken from obscure magazines of long ago.

The early poems are more lyrical than where I am at now. I like these
poems but I disagree with some who claim, "Bukowski's early work was
much better." Some have made these claims in critical reviews, others in
parlors of gossip.

Now the reader can make his own judgment, first hand.

In my present poetry, I go at matters more directly, land on them and
then get out. I don't believe that my early methods and my late methods
are either inferior or superior to one another. They are different,
that's all.

Yet, re-reading these, there remains a certain fondness for that time.
Coming in from the factory or warehouse, tired enough, there seemed
little use for the night except to eat, sleep and then return to the
menial job. But there was the typewriter waiting for me in those many
old rooms with torn shades and worn rugs, the tub and toilet down the
hall, and the feeling in the air of all the losers who had preceded me.
Sometimes the typewriter was there when the job wasn't and the food
wasn't and the rent wasn't. Sometimes the typer was in hock. Sometimes
there was only the park bench. But at the best of times there was the
small room and the machine and the bottle. The sound of the keys, on and
on, and shouts: "HEY! KNOCK

[Page 6 ]

IT OFF, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE! WE'RE WORKING PEOPLE HERE AND WE'VE GOT TO
GET UP IN THE MORNING!" With broomsticks knocking on the floor, pounding
coming from the ceiling, I would work in a last few lines....

I was not Hamsun eating his own flesh in order to continue writing but I
had a fair amount of travail. The poems were sent out as written on
first impulse, no line or word changes. I never revised or retyped. To
eliminate an error, I would simply go over it thus: #########, and go on
with the line. One magazine editor printed a group of my poems with all
the ########s intact.

At any rate, here are many of the poems from that wondrous and crazy
time, from those distant hours. The room steamed with smoke, dizzied
with fumes, we gambled. I hope they work for you. And if they don't,
well, #### ## ###.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /22,000 Dollars in 3 Months/ [from The
        Rooming House Madrigals: Early Selected Poems, 1946-1966 (1988)
        , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   night has come like something crawling
2   up the bannister, sticking out its tongue
3   of fire, and I remember the
4   missionaries up to their knees in muck
5   retreating across the beautiful blue river
6   and the machine gun slugs flicking spots of
7   fountain and Jones drunk on the shore
8   saying shit shit these Indians
9   where'd they get the fire power?
10   and I went in to see Maria
11   and she said, do you think they'll attack,
12   do you think they'll come across the river?
13   afraid to die? I asked her, and she said
14   who isn't?
15   and I went to the medicine cabinet
16   and poured a tall glassful, and I said
17   we've made 22,000 dollars in 3 months building roads
18   for Jones and you have to die a little
19   to make it that fast ... Do you think the communists
20   started this? she asked, do you think it's the communists?
21   and I said, will you stop being a neurotic bitch.
22   these small countries rise because they are getting
23   their pockets filled from /both/ sides ... and she
24   looked at me with that beautiful schoolgirl idiocy
25   and she walked out, it was getting dark but I let her go,
26   you've got to know when to let a woman go if you want to
27   keep her,
28   and if you don't want to keep her you let her go anyhow,
29   so it's always a process of letting go, one way or the other,
30   so I sat there and put the drink down and made another
31   and I thought, whoever thought an engineering course at Old Miss
32   would bring you where the lamps swing slowly
33   in the green of some far night?
34   and Jones came in with his arm around her blue waist
35   and she had been drinking too, and I walked up and said,

[Page 14 ]


36   man and wife? and that made her angry for if a woman can't
37   get you by the nuts and squeeze, she's done,
38   and I poured another tall one, and
39   I said, you 2 may not realize it
40   but we're not going to get out of here alive.


41   we drank the rest of the night.
42   you could hear, if you were real still,
43   the water coming down between the god trees,
44   and the roads we had built
45   you could hear animals crossing them
46   and the Indians, savage fools with some savage cross to bear.
47   and finally there was the last look in the mirror
48   as the drunken lovers hugged
49   and I walked out and lifted a piece of straw
50   from the roof of the hut
51   then snapped the lighter, and I
52   watched the flames crawl, like hungry mice
53   up the thin brown stalks, it was slow but it was
54   real, and then not real, something like an opera,
55   and then I walked down toward the machine gun sounds,
56   the same river, and the moon looked across at me
57   and in the path I saw a small snake, just a small one,
58   looked like a rattler, but it couldn't be a rattler,
59   and it was scared seeing me, and I grabbed it behind the neck
60   before it could coil and I held it then
61   its little body curled around my wrist
62   like a finger of love and all the trees looked with eyes
63   and I put my mouth to its mouth
64   and love was lightning and remembrance,
65   dead communists, dead fascists, dead democrats, dead gods and
66   back in what was left of the hut Jones
67   had his dead black arm around her dead blue waist.

        My Love/ [from The Rooming House Madrigals: Early Selected
        Poems, 1946-1966 (1988) , Black Sparrow Press ]




        I



1   the cannoneer is dead,
2   and all the troops;


3   the conceited drummer boy
4   dumber than the tombs
5   lies in a net of red;


6   and under leaves, bugs twitch antennae
7   deciding which way to move
8   under the cool umbrella of decay;


9   the wind rills down like thin water
10   and searches under clothing,
11   sifting and sorry;


12   ... clothing anchored with heavy bones
13   in noonday sleep
14   like men gone down on ladders, resting;


15   yet an hour ago
16   tree-shadow and man-shadow
17   showed their outline against the sun---


18   yet now, not a man amongst them
19   can single out the reason
20   that moved them down toward nothing;


21   and I think mostly of some woman far off
22   arranging important jars on some second shelf
23   and humming a dry, sun-lit tune.

[Page 16 ]



        II


24   outside, the quick storm turns the night slowly
25   backwards
26   and sends it shifting to old shores,
27   and everywhere are bones ... rib bones and light,
28   and grass, grass leaning left;
29   and we hump our backs against the wet like living things,
30   and this one with me now
31   holds my yearning like a packet
32   slips it into her purse with her powders and potions
33   pulls up a sheer stocking, chatters, touches her hair:
34   /it's raining, oh damn it all, it's raining!/
35   and on the battlefield the rocks are wet and cool,
36   the fine grains of rock glint moon-fire,
37   and she curses under a small green hat
38   like a crown
39   and walks like a gawky marionette
40   into the strings of rain.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /What to Do with Contributor's Copies?/
        [from The Rooming House Madrigals: Early Selected Poems,
        1946-1966 (1988) , Black Sparrow Press ]


(Dear Sir: Although we realize it is insufficient payment for your
poems, you will receive 4 contributor's copies, which we will mail
directly to you or to anyone you wish.---Note from the Editor.)



1   well, ya better mail one to M.S. or she'll prob.
2   put her pisser in the oven, she thinks she is hot
3   stuff, and mabe she is, I sure as hell wd't
4   know
5   then there is C.W. who does not answer his mail
6   but is very busy teaching young boys how to write
7   and I know he is going places, and since he is,
8   ya better mail 'm one ...
9   then there's my old aunt in
10   Palm Springs nothing but money and I have
11   everything but money ... talent, a good singing voice,
12   a left hook deep to the gut ... send her a copy,
13   she hung up on me, last time I phoned her drunk,
14   giving evidence of need, she hung up
15   on me ...
16   then there's this girl in Sacramento who
17   writes me these little letters ... very depressed
18   bitch, mixed and beaten like some waffle, making
19   gentle intellectual overtures which I ignore,
20   but send her a magazine
21   in lieu of a hot poker.


22   that makes 4?
23   I hope to send you some more poems
24   soon because I figure that
25   people who print my poems are a little
26   mad, but that's all right. I am also
27   that way. anyhow---

[Page 18 ]




28   I hope
29   meanwhile
30   you do not fold up
31   before
32   I
33   do.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /Brave Bull/ [from The Rooming House
        Madrigals: Early Selected Poems, 1946-1966 (1988) , Black
        Sparrow Press ]


1   I did not know
2   that the Mexicans
3   did this:
4   the bull
5   had been brave
6   and now
7   they dragged him
8   dead
9   around the ring
10   by his
11   tail,
12   a brave bull
13   dead,
14   but not just another bull,
15   this was a special
16   bull,
17   and to me
18   a special
19   lesson ...
20   and although Brahms
21   stole his /First/ from Beethoven's
22   /9th./
23   and although
24   the bull
25   was dead
26   his head and his horns and
27   his insides dead,
28   he had been better than
29   Brahms,
30   as good as
31   Beethoven,
32   and

[Page 20 ]


33   as we walked out
34   the sound and meaning
35   of him
36   kept crawling up my arms
37   and although people bumped me and
38   stepped on my toes
39   the bull burned within me
40   my candle of
41   jesus,
42   dragged by his tail
43   he had nothing to do
44   having done it all,
45   and through the long tunnels and minatory glances,
46   the elbows and feet and eyes, I prayed for California,
47   and the dead bull
48   in man
49   and in me,
50   and I clasped my hands
51   deep within my
52   pockets, seized darkness,
53   and moved on.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /It's Not Who Lived Here/ [from The Rooming
        House Madrigals: Early Selected Poems, 1946-1966 (1988) , Black
        Sparrow Press ]



1   but who died here;
2   and it's not when
3   but how;
4   it's not
5   the known great
6   but the great who died unknown;
7   it's not
8   the history
9   of countries
10   but the lives of men.


11   fables are dreams,
12   not lies,
13   and
14   truth changes
15   as
16   men change,
17   and when truth becomes stable
18   men
19   will
20   become dead
21   and
22   the insect
23   and the fire and
24   the flood
25   will become
26   truth.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /O, We Are the Outcasts/ [from The Rooming
        House Madrigals: Early Selected Poems, 1946-1966 (1988) , Black
        Sparrow Press ]



1   ah, christ, what a CREW:
2   more
3   /poetry/ , always more
4   P O E T R Y .


5   if it doesn't come, coax it out with a
6   laxative. get your name in LIGHTS,
7   get it up there in
8   8½ × 11 mimeo.


9   keep it coming like a miracle.


10   ah christ, writers are the most sickening
11   of all the louts!
12   yellow-toothed, slump-shouldered,
13   gutless, flea-bitten and
14   obvious ... in tinker-toy rooms
15   with their flabby hearts
16   they tell us
17   what's wrong with the world---
18   as if we didn't know that a cop's club
19   can crack the head
20   and that war is a dirtier game than
21   marriage ...
22   or down in a basement bar
23   hiding from a wife who doesn't appreciate him
24   and children he doesn't
25   want
26   he tells us that his heart is drowning in
27   vomit. hell, all our hearts are drowning in vomit,
28   in pork salt, in bad verse, in soggy
29   love.
30   but he thinks he's alone and
31   he thinks he's special and he thinks he's Rimbaud

[Page 23 ]


32   and he thinks he's
33   Pound.


34   and death! how about death? did you know
35   that we all have to die? even Keats died, even
36   Milton!
37   and D. Thomas---THEY KILLED HIM, of course.
38   Thomas didn't /want/ all those free drinks
39   all that free pussy---
40   they ... FORCED IT ON HIM
41   when they should have left him alone so he could
42   write write WRITE!


43   poets.


44   and there's another
45   type. I've met them at their country
46   places (don't ask me what I was doing there because
47   I don't know).


48   they were born with money and
49   they don't have to dirty their hands in
50   slaughterhouses or washing
51   dishes in grease joints or
52   driving cabs or pimping or selling pot.


53   this gives them time to understand
54   Life.


55   they walk in with their cocktail glass
56   held about heart high
57   and when they drink they just
58   /sip./


59   you are drinking green beer which you
60   brought with you
61   because you have found out through the years
62   that rich bastards are /tight/ ---

[Page 24 ]




63   they use 5 cent stamps instead of airmail
64   they promise to have all sorts of goodies ready
65   upon your arrival
66   from gallons of whiskey to
67   50 cent cigars. but it's never
68   there.
69   and they HIDE their women from you---
70   their wives, x-wives, daughters, maids, so forth,
71   because they've read your poems and
72   figure all you want to do is fuck everybody and
73   everything. which once might have been
74   true but is no longer /quite/
75   true.


76   and---
77   /he/ WRITES TOO.
78   POETRY, of
79   course. /everybody/
80   writes
81   poetry.


82   he has plenty of time and a
83   postoffice box in town
84   and he drives there 3 or 4 times a day
85   looking and hoping for accepted
86   poems.


87   he thinks that poverty is a weakness of the
88   soul.


89   he thinks your mind is ill because you are
90   drunk all the time and have to work in a
91   factory 10 or 12 hours a
92   night.


93   he brings his wife in, a beauty, stolen from a
94   poorer rich
95   man.

[Page 25 ]




96   he lets you gaze for 30 seconds
97   then hustles her
98   out. she has been crying for some
99   reason.


100   you've got 3 or 4 days to linger in the
101   guesthouse he says,
102   "come on over to dinner
103   sometime."
104   but he doesn't say when or
105   where. and then you find that you are not even
106   IN HIS HOUSE.


107   you are in
108   ONE of his houses but
109   /his/ house is somewhere
110   else---
111   you don't know
112   where.


113   he even has x-wives in some of his
114   houses.


115   his main concern is to keep his x-wives away from
116   you. he doesn't want to give up a
117   damn thing. and you can't blame him:
118   his x-wives are all young, stolen, kept,
119   talented, well-dressed, schooled, with
120   varying French-German accents.


121   and!: they
122   WRITE POETRY TOO. or
123   PAINT. or
124   fuck.


125   but his big problem is to get down to that mail
126   box in town to get back his
127   rejected poems

[Page 26 ]


128   and to keep his eye on all the other mail boxes
129   in all his other
130   houses.


131   meanwhile, the starving Indians
132   sell beads and baskets in the streets of the small desert
133   town.


134   the Indians are not allowed in his houses
135   not so much because they are a fuck-threat
136   but because they are
137   /dirty/ and
138   ignorant. dirty? I look down at my shirt
139   with the beerstain on the front.
140   ignorant? I light a 6 cent cigar and
141   forget about
142   it.


143   he or they or somebody was supposed to meet me at
144   the
145   train station.


146   of course, they weren't
147   there. "We'll be there to meet the great
148   Poet!"


149   well, I looked around and didn't see any
150   great poet. besides it was 7 a.m. and
151   40 degrees. those things
152   happen. the trouble was there were no
153   bars open. nothing open. not even a
154   jail.


155   he's a poet.
156   he's also a doctor, a head-shrinker.
157   no blood involved that
158   way. he won't tell me whether I am crazy or
159   not---I don't have the
160   money.

[Page 27 ]




161   he walks out with his cocktail glass
162   disappears for 2 hours, 3 hours,
163   then suddenly comes walking back in
164   unannounced
165   with the same cocktail glass
166   to make sure I haven't gotten hold of
167   something more precious than
168   Life itself.


169   my cheap green beer is killing
170   me. he shows heart (hurrah) and
171   gives me a little pill that stops my
172   gagging.
173   but nothing decent to
174   drink.


175   he'd bought a small 6 pack
176   for my arrival but that was gone in an
177   hour and 15
178   minutes.


179   "I'll buy you barrels of beer," he had
180   said.


181   I used his phone (one of his phones)
182   to get deliveries of beer and
183   cheap whiskey. the town was ten miles away,
184   downhill. I peeled my poor dollars from my poor
185   roll. and the boy needed a tip, of
186   course.


187   the way it was shaping up I could see that I was
188   hardly Dylan Thomas yet, not even
189   Robert Creeley. certainly Creeley wouldn't have
190   had beerstains on his
191   shirt.

[Page 28 ]




192   anyhow, when I finally got hold of one of his
193   x-wives I was too drunk to
194   make it.


195   scared too. sure, I imagined him peering
196   through the window---
197   he didn't want to give up a damn thing---
198   and
199   leveling the luger while I was
200   working
201   while "The March to the Gallows" was playing over
202   the Muzak
203   and shooting me in the ass first and
204   my poor brain
205   later.


206   "an intruder," I could hear him telling them,
207   "ravishing one of my helpless x-wives."


208   I see him published in some of the magazines
209   now. not very good stuff.


210   a poem about me
211   too: the Polack.


212   the Polack whines too much. the Polack whines about his
213   country, other countries, all countries, the Polack
214   works overtime in a factory like a fool, among other
215   fools with "pre-drained spirits."
216   the Polack drinks seas of green beer
217   full of acid. the Polack has an ulcerated
218   hemorrhoid. the Polack picks on fags
219   "fragile fags." the Polack hates his
220   wife, hates his daughter. his daughter will become
221   an alcoholic, a prostitute. the Polack has an
222   "obese burned out wife." the Polack has a
223   spastic gut. the Polack has a
224   "rectal brain."

[Page 29 ]




225   thank you, Doctor (and poet). any charge for
226   this? I know I still owe you for the
227   pill.


228   Your poem is not too good
229   but at least I got your starch up.
230   most of your stuff is about as lively as a
231   wet and deflated
232   beachball. but it is your round, you've won a round.
233   going to invite me out this
234   Summer? I might scrape up
235   trainfare. got an Indian friend who'd like to meet
236   you and yours. he swears he's got the biggest
237   pecker in the state of California.


238   and guess what?
239   he writes
240   POETRY
241   too!

1   To end up alone
2   in a tomb of a room
3   without cigarettes
4   or wine---
5   just a lightbulb
6   and a potbelly,
7   grayhaired,
8   and glad to have
9   the room.


10   ... in the morning
11   they're out there
12   making money:
13   judges, carpenters,
14   plumbers, doctors,
15   newsboys, policemen,
16   barbers, carwashers,
17   dentists, florists,
18   waitresses, cooks,
19   cabdrivers ...


20   and you turn over
21   to your left side
22   to get the sun
23   on your back
24   and out
25   of your eyes.

1   There is enough treachery, hatred,
2   violence,
3   Absurdity in the average human
4   being
5   To supply any given army on any given
6   day.
7   AND The Best At Murder Are Those
8   Who Preach Against It.
9   AND The Best At Hate Are Those
10   Who Preach LOVE
11   AND THE BEST AT WAR
12   ---FINALLY---ARE THOSE WHO
13   PREACH
14   PEACE


15   Those Who Preach GOD
16   NEED God
17   Those Who Preach PEACE
18   Do Not Have Peace.
19   THOSE WHO PREACH LOVE
20   DO NOT HAVE LOVE
21   BEWARE THE PREACHERS
22   Beware The Knowers.


23   Beware
24   Those Who
25   Are ALWAYS
26   READING
27   BOOKS


28   Beware Those Who Either Detest
29   Poverty Or Are Proud Of It


30   BEWARE Those Quick To Praise
31   For They Need PRAISE In Return

[Page 32 ]


32   BEWARE Those Quick To Censure:
33   They Are Afraid Of What They Do
34   Not Know


35   Beware Those Who Seek Constant
36   Crowds; They Are Nothing
37   Alone


38   Beware
39   The Average Man
40   The Average Woman
41   BEWARE Their Love


42   Their Love Is Average, Seeks
43   Average
44   But There Is Genius In Their Hatred
45   There Is Enough Genius In Their
46   Hatred To Kill You, To Kill
47   Anybody.


48   Not Wanting Solitude
49   Not Understanding Solitude
50   They Will Attempt To Destroy
51   Anything
52   That Differs
53   From Their Own


54   Not Being Able
55   To Create Art
56   They Will Not
57   Understand Art


58   They Will Consider Their Failure
59   As Creators
60   Only As A Failure
61   Of The World

[Page 33 ]


62   Not Being Able To Love Fully
63   They Will BELIEVE Your Love
64   Incomplete
65   AND THEN THEY WILL HATE
66   YOU


67   And Their Hatred Will Be Perfect
68   Like A Shining Diamond
69   Like A Knife
70   Like A Mountain
71   LIKE A TIGER
72   LIKE Hemlock


73   Their Finest

1   the fields rattle
2   with red birds;
3   it is 4:30 in
4   the morning,
5   it is always
6   4:30 in the morning,
7   and I listen for
8   my friends:
9   the garbagemen
10   and the thieves,
11   and cats dreaming
12   red birds
13   and red birds dreaming
14   worms,
15   and worms dreaming
16   along the bones of
17   my love,
18   and I cannot sleep,
19   and soon morning will come,
20   the workers will rise,
21   and they will look for me
22   at the docks,
23   and they will say,
24   "he is drunk again,"
25   but I will be asleep,
26   finally,
27   among the bottles and
28   sunlight,
29   all darkness gone,
30   my arms spread like
31   a cross,
32   the red birds
33   flying,
34   flying,
35   roses opening in the smoke,

[Page 35 ]


36   and
37   like something stabbed and
38   healing,
39   like
40   40 pages through a bad novel,
41   a smile upon
42   my idiot's face.

1   man shot through back while

3   who looks like a woman,
4   and here we hang:
5   moon-bright
6   neatly gloved,
7   motorcycles everywhere, bees asleep,
8   nozzles rusted,
9   climate awry,
10   and we shake our bones,
11   blind skin there,
12   and the soldier falls dead,
13   another dead soldier,
14   the black robe of a young priest
15   who looks like a woman
16   is now beautifully red,
17   and the tanks
18   come on through.

        , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   bird-dream and peeling wallpaper
2   symptoms of grey sleep
3   and at 4 a.m. Whitey came out of his room
4   (the solace of the poor is in numbers
5   like Summer poppies)
6   and he began to scream /help me! help me! help me!/
7   (an old man with hair as white as any ivory tusk)
8   and he was vomiting blood
9   /help me help me help me/
10   and I helped him lie down in the hall
11   and I beat on the landlady's door
12   (she is as French as the best wine but as tough as
13   an American steak) and
14   I hollered her name, /Marcella! Marcella!/
15   (the milkman would soon be coming with his
16   pure white bottles like chilled lilies)
17   /Marcella! Marcella! help me help me help me,/
18   and she screamed back through the door:
19   you polack bastard, are you drunk again? then
20   Promethean the eye at the door
21   and she
22   sized up the red river in her rectangular brain
23   (oh, I am nothing but a drunken polack
24   a bad pinch-hitter a writer of letters to the newspapers)
25   and she spoke into the phone like a lady ordering bread and
26   eggs,
27   and I held to the wall
28   dreaming bad poems and my own death
29   and the men came ... one with a cigar, the other needing a
30   shave,
31   and they made him stand up and walk down the steps
32   his ivory head on fire (Whitey, my drinking pal---
33   all the songs, Sing Gypsy, Laugh Gypsy, talk about
34   the war, the fights, the good whores,
35   skid-row hotels floating in wine,

[Page 38 ]


36   floating in crazy talk,
37   cheap cigars and anger)
38   and the siren took him away, except the red part
39   and I began to vomit and the French wolverine screamed
40   /you'll have to clean it up, all of it, you and Whitey!/
41   and the steamers sailed and rich men on yachts
42   kissed girls young enough to be their daughters,
43   and the milkman came by and stared
44   and the neon lights blinked selling something
45   tires or oil or underwear
46   and she slammed her door and I was alone
47   ashamed
48   it was the war, the war forever, the war was never over,
49   and I cried against the peeling walls,
50   the weakness of our bones, our sotted half-brains,
51   and morning began to creep into the hall---
52   toilets flushed, there was bacon, there was coffee,
53   there were hangovers, and I too
54   went in and closed my door and sat down and waited for the
55   sun.

1   O lord, he said, Japanese women,
2   real women, they have not forgotten,
3   bowing and smiling
4   closing the wounds men have made;
5   but American women will kill you like they
6   tear a lampshade,
7   American women care less than a dime,
8   they've gotten derailed,
9   they're too nervous to make good:
10   always scowling, belly-aching,
11   disillusioned, overwrought;
12   but oh lord, say, the Japanese women:
13   there was this one,
14   I came home and the door was locked
15   and when I broke in she broke out the bread knife
16   and chased me under the bed
17   and her sister came
18   and they kept me under that bed for two days,
19   and when I came out, at last,
20   she didn't mention attorneys,
21   just said, you will never wrong me again,
22   and I didn't; but she died on me,
23   and dying, said, you can wrong me now,
24   and I did,
25   but you know, I felt worse then
26   than when she was living;
27   there was no voice, no knife,
28   nothing but little Japanese prints on the wall,
29   all those tiny people sitting by red rivers
30   with flying green birds,
31   and I took them down and put them face down
32   in a drawer with my shirts,
33   and it was the first time I realized
34   that she was dead, even though I buried her;
35   and some day I'll take them all out again,

[Page 40 ]


36   all the tan-faced little people
37   sitting happily by their bridges and huts
38   and mountains---
39   but not right now,
40   not just yet.

        The Rooming House Madrigals: Early Selected Poems, 1946-1966
        (1988) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   due to weekend conditions, and although there's
2   too much smog, everything's jammed
3   and it's worse than masts down in a storm
4   you can't go anywhere
5   and if you do, they are all staring through glass windows
6   or waiting for dinner, and no matter how bad it is
7   (not the glass, the dinner)
8   they'll spend more time talking about it
9   than eating it,
10   and that's why my wife got rid of me:
11   I was a boor and didn't know when to smile
12   or rather (worse) I did,
13   but didn't, and one afternoon
14   with people diving into pools
15   and playing cards
16   and watching carefully shaven T.V. comedians
17   in starched white shirts and fine neckties
18   kidding about what the world had done to them,
19   I pretended a headache
20   and they gave me the young lady's bedroom
21   (she was about 17)
22   and hell, I crawled beneath her sheets
23   and pretended to sleep
24   but everybody knew I was a cornered fake,
25   but I tried all sorts of tricks---
26   I tried to think of Wilde behind bars,
27   but Wilde was dead;
28   I tried to think of Hem shooting a lion
29   or walking down Paris streets
30   medallioned with his wild buddies,
31   the whores swooning to their beautiful knees,
32   but all I did was twist within her young sheets,
33   and from the headboard, shaking in my nervous storm,
34   several trinkets fell upon me---
35   elephants, glass dogs with seductive stares,

[Page 42 ]


36   a young boy and girl carrying a pail of water,
37   but nothing by Bach or conducted by Ormandy,
38   and I finally gave it up, went into the john
39   and tried to piss (I knew I would be constipated
40   for a week), and then I walked out,
41   and my wife, a reader of Plato and e.e. cummings
42   ran up and said, "ooooh, you should have /seen/
43   BooBoo at the pool! He turned backflips and sideflips
44   and it was the funniest thing you've
45   EVER seen!"


46   I think it was not much later that the man came
47   to our third floor apartment
48   about seven in the morning
49   and handed me a summons for divorce,
50   and I went back to bed with her and said,
51   don't worry, it's all right, and
52   she began to cry cry cry,
53   I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
54   and I said, please stop,
55   remember your heart.


56   but that morning when she left
57   about 8 o'clock she looked
58   the same as ever, maybe even better.
59   I didn't even bother to shave;
60   I called in sick and went down
61   to the corner bar.

1   and the next I remembered I'm on a table,
2   everybody's gone: the head of bravery
3   under light, scowling, flailing me down ...
4   and then some toad stood there, smoking a cigar:
5   "Kid you're no fighter," he told me,
6   and I got up and knocked him over a chair;
7   it was like a scene in a movie, and
8   he stayed there on his big rump and said
9   over and over: "Jesus, Jesus, whatsamatta wit
10   you?" and I got up and dressed,
11   the tape still on my hands, and when I got home
12   I tore the tape off my hands and
13   wrote my first poem,
14   and I've been fighting
15   ever since.

1   at the sea at the beach in the dark there was somebody
2   sitting in a car along the shore and playing this drum
3   as if in Africa and the cops rode by on the sidewalk
4   and I went down to the disappointing sea
5   and saw two blue lights in the water and a boat
6   and a man walked by in a white shirt and squatted by the
7   shore and got up and walked along the shore
8   and then another man came and followed him:
9   they both walked along the shore by the water
10   one 12 feet behind the other and I watched them until
11   they disappeared and then I got up and walked through
12   the sand to the cement and through a bar door I saw a
13   negro singing with a light on his face
14   he wailed a strange song and the sound of the song twisted
15   in the air and everything was empty and dry and easy
16   and I got into my car and drove back to the hot city
17   but I knew I would always remember the time
18   and the catch of it---the way the night hung undisturbed
19   with people walking on it like some quiet rug
20   and a small boat rocking bravely by bulldogging water
21   and the colored pier lights like a broken mind sick in the sea.

1   the legs are gone and the hopes---the lava of outpouring,
2   and I haven't shaved in sixteen days
3   but the mailman still makes his rounds and
4   water still comes out of the faucet and I have a photo of
5   myself with glazed and milky eyes full of simple music
6   in golden trunks and 12 oz. gloves when I made the semi-finals
7   only to be taken out by a German brute who should have been
8   locked in a cage for the insane and allowed to drink blood.
9   Now I am insane and stare at the wallpaper as one would stare
10   at a Cézanne or an early Picasso (he has lost it), and I sent out
11   the girls for beer, the old girls who barely bother to wipe
12   their asses and say, well, I guess I won't comb my hair today:
13   it might bring me luck! well, anyway, they wash the dishes and
14   chop the wood, and the landlady keeps saying let me in, I can't
15   get in, you've got the lock on, and what's all that singing and
16   cussing in there? but she only wants a piece of ass, she pretends
17   she wants the rent
18   but she's not gonna get either one of 'em.
19   meanwhile the skulls of the dead are full of beetles and
20   old football scores like S.C. 16, N.D. 14 on a John
21   Baker field goal.


22   I can see the fleet from my window, the sails and the guns,
23   always
24   the guns poking their eyes in the sky looking for trouble like
25   young
26   L.A. cops who haven't yet shaved and the young sailors out
27   there sex-hungry, trying to act tough, trying to act like men
28   but really closer to their mother's nipples than to a true evalu-
29   ation of existence. I say, god damn it, that
30   the legs are gone and the outpourings too. inside my brain
31   rats snip and snipe and
32   pour oil
33   to burn and fire out early dreams.
34   darling, says one of the girls, you've got to snap out of it,

[Page 46 ]


35   we're running out of MONEY. how do you want
36   your toast?
37   light or dark?


38   a woman's a woman, I say, and I put my binoculars between
39   her
40   kneecaps and I can see where
41   empires have fallen.


42   I wish I had a brush, some paint, some paint and a brush, I say.


43   why? asks one of the
44   whores


45   BECAUSE RATS DON'T LIKE OIL! I scream.


46   (I can't do it. I don't belong here. I listen to radio programs
47   and people's voices and I marvel that they can get excited
48   and interested over nothing) and I flick out the lights, I
49   crash out the lights, and I pull the shades down, I
50   tear the shades down as I light my last cigar
51   then dream jump from the Empire State Building
52   into the thickheaded bullbrained mob with the hard-on attitude;
53   already forgotten the dead of Normandy, Lincoln's stringy
54   beard,
55   all the bulls that have died to flashing red capes,
56   all the love that has died in women and men
57   while fools have been elevated to the trumpet's succulent sneer
58   and I have fought (red-handed and drunk
59   in slop-pitted alleys)
60   the bartenders of this rotten land.


61   and I laugh, I can still laugh, who can't laugh when the whole
62   thing
63   is so ridiculous
64   that only the insane, the clowns, the half-wits,
65   the cheaters, the whores, the horseplayers, the bankrobbers, the
66   poets ... are interesting?

[Page 47 ]


67   in the dark I hear hands reaching for the last of my money
68   like mice nibbling at paper, automatic, while I slumber,
69   a false drunken God asleep at the wheel ...
70   a quarter rolls across the floor, and I remember all the faces and
71   the football heroes, and everything has meaning, and an editor
72   writes me, you are good
73   but
74   you are too emotional
75   the way to whip life is to quietly frame the agony,
76   study it and put it to sleep in the abstract.


77   is there anything less abstract
78   than dying everyday and
79   on the last day?


80   the door closes and the last of the great whores are gone
81   and they are all great, somehow no matter how they have
82   killed me, they are great, and I smoke quietly
83   thinking of Mexico, of the decaying horses and dead bulls,
84   of Havana and Spain and Normandy, of the jabbering insane,
85   of the Kamikaze
86   winning whether they lived or died,
87   of my dead friends, of no more friends
88   ever; and the voice of my Mexican buddy saying, you won't die
89   you won't die in this war, you're too smart, you'll take care
90   of yourself.


91   I keep thinking of the bulls. the rotting bulls, dying everyday.
92   the whores are gone. the shells have stopped for a minute.


93   fuck everybody.

1   All I know is this: the ravens kiss my mouth,
2   the veins are tangled here,
3   the sea is made of blood.


4   All I know is this: the hands reaching out,
5   my eyes are closed, my ears are closed,
6   the sky rejects my scream.


7   All I know is this: my nostrils drip with dreams
8   the hounds lap us up, the fools laugh out,
9   the clock ticks out the dead.


10   All I know is this: my feet are sorrow here,
11   my words are less than lilies, my words are clotted now:
12   the ravens kiss my mouth.

1   they talk down through
2   the centuries to us,
3   and this we need more and more,
4   the statues and paintings
5   in midnight age
6   as we go along
7   holding dead hands.


8   and we would say
9   rather than delude the unknowing:
10   a damn good show,
11   but hardly enough for a horse to eat,
12   and out on the sunshine street where
13   eyes are dabbled in metazoan faces
14   I decide again
15   that in these centuries
16   they have done very well
17   considering the nature of their
18   brothers:
19   it's more than good
20   that some of them,
21   (closer really to field-mouse than
22   falcon)
23   have been bold enough to try.

1   and the hedges wet in the rain, flaking in a sheet of wind,
2   and for a moment everything working: rusty bells, April
3   birds, unblushing brides, anything you can name that has not
4   died, so exactly, and even the wind like a lover's hand,
5   a somehow important wind, something too like sleep or slain
6   enemies,
7   and the feet move through paths not restricted by the
8   bull-goaded mind,
9   and see---all and everywhere---hedges in the rain
10   like great cathedrals now, new Caesars, cats walking,
11   new gods without plug or wire, love without wasps,
12   new Christians, bulls, Romes, new new leaves, new rain
13   now splashing through the fire; and I close the door, old room,
14   I fall upon the couch, I sweat
15   and I cough I cough small words
16   lions bearing down through coffee cups and puddles, I
17   sigh, Cleopatra. Not for either of us, but for the rest.

1   Making love in the sun, in the morning sun
2   in a hotel room
3   above the alley
4   where poor men poke for bottles;
5   making love in the sun
6   making love by a carpet redder than our blood,
7   making love while the boys sell headlines
8   and Cadillacs,
9   making love by a photograph of Paris
10   and an open pack of Chesterfields,
11   making love while other men---poor fools---
12   work.


13   That moment---to this ...
14   may be years in the way they measure,
15   but it's only one sentence back in my mind---
16   there are so many days
17   when living stops and pulls up and sits
18   and waits like a train on the rails.
19   I pass the hotel at 8
20   and at 5; there are cats in the alleys
21   and bottles and bums,
22   and I look up at the window and think,
23   /I no longer know where you are,/
24   and I walk on and wonder where
25   the living goes
26   when it stops.

1   the dirty dogs of Egypt stride down my bones
2   the cat goes home in the morning
3   and I think of agony when there's little else to
4   do, and there's usually little else to do
5   except think the agony might kill us---
6   but, perhaps, what really saves us from it
7   is our being able to luxuriate in it---
8   like an old lady putting on a red hat.


9   yet my walls are stained where broken glass has
10   pissed its liquor.


11   I see agony in a box of kitchen soap
12   and the walls want their flatness to be my
13   flatness, o the dirty dogs of Egypt,
14   I see flatirons hanging from hooks
15   the eagle is a canary in the breakfastnook
16   eating dry seed and cramped by the dream.


17   I want so much that is not here and do not know
18   where to go.

1   this thing upon me is not death
2   but it's as real
3   and as landlords full of maggots
4   pound for rent
5   I eat walnuts in the sheath
6   of my privacy
7   and listen for more important
8   drummers;
9   it's as real, it's as real
10   as the broken-boned sparrow
11   cat-mouthed, uttering
12   more than mere
13   miserable argument;
14   between my toes I stare
15   at clouds, at seas of gaunt
16   sepulcher ...
17   and scratch my back
18   and form a vowel
19   as all my lovely women
20   (wives and lovers)
21   break like engines
22   into steam of sorrow
23   to be blown into eclipse;
24   bone is bone
25   but this thing upon me
26   as I tear the window shades
27   and walk caged rugs,
28   this thing upon me
29   like a flower and a feast,
30   believe me
31   is not death and is not
32   glory
33   and like Quixote's windmills
34   makes a foe
35   turned by the heavens

[Page 54 ]


36   against one man;
37   ... this thing upon me,
38   great god,
39   this thing upon me
40   crawling like a snake,
41   terrifying my love of commonness,
42   some call Art
43   some call Poetry;
44   it's not death
45   but dying will solve its power
46   and as my grey hands
47   drop a last desperate pen
48   in some cheap room
49   they will find me there
50   and never know
51   my name
52   my meaning
53   nor the treasure
54   of my escape.

4   and the N.wester ripped the sheets like toenails

8   some punk had a drunken slut (my wife)

12   and crawling in the pantry
13   amongst the clanking dishes
14   with flowers and vines painted on them

        Rooming House Madrigals: Early Selected Poems, 1946-1966 (1988)
        , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   listen, I went to get a haircut, it was a perfectly good day
2   until they brought it to me, I mean I sat waiting my turn in the
3   chair and I found a magazine---the usual thing: women with their
4   breasts hanging out, etc., and then I turned the page and here
5   were photos of Orientals in a field, there was a big
6   bastard with the sword---the caption said he had a very good
7   swing, plenty of power and the picture showed him getting ready
8   with the sword, and you saw an Oriental kneeling there with his
9   eyes closed, then---ZIP!---he was kneeling there without a head
10   and you could see the neck clean, not yet even
11   spurting blood, the separation having been so astonishingly
12   swift, and more photos of beheadings, and then a photo of these
13   heads lolling in the weeds without bodies, the sun shining on
14   them.
15   and the heads looking still almost alive as if they hadn't
16   accepted the death---and then the barber said
17   next!


18   and I walked over to the chair and my head was still on
19   and his head said to my head,
20   how do you want it?
21   and I said, medium.


22   and he seemed like a nice sensible fellow
23   and it seemed nice to be near nice sensible fellows
24   and I wanted to ask him about the heads
25   but I thought it would upset him
26   or maybe even give him ideas
27   or he might say something that wouldn't help at
28   all
29   so I kept quiet.


30   I listened to him cut my hair
31   and he began talking about his baby
32   and I tried to concentrate on his

[Page 57 ]


33   baby, it seemed very sane and logical
34   but I still kept thinking about the
35   heads.


36   when he finished the cutting
37   he turned me in the chair so I could look into the
38   mirror. my head was still on.


39   fine, I told him, and I got out of the chair, paid, and
40   gave him a good tip.


41   I walked outside and a woman walked by and she had her
42   head on and all the people driving cars had their heads
43   on.


44   I should have concentrated on the breasts, I thought,
45   it's so much better, all that hanging out, or
46   the magic and beautiful legs, sex was a fine thing
47   after all, but my day was spoiled, it would take a night's sleep
48   anyway, to get rid of the heads. it was terrible to be a human
49   being: there was so much going
50   on.


51   I saw my head in a plateglass window
52   I saw the reflection
53   and my head had a cigarette in it
54   my head looked tired and sad
55   it was not smiling with its new
56   haircut.


57   then
58   it disappeared
59   and I walked on
60   past the houses full of furniture and cats and
61   dogs and people
62   and they were lucky and I threw the cigarette
63   into the gutter
64   saw it burning on the asphalt

[Page 58 ]


65   red and white, a tender spit of smoke,
66   and I decided that the sun
67   felt good.

        [from The Rooming House Madrigals: Early Selected Poems,
        1946-1966 (1988) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   he lives in a house with a swimming pool
2   and says the job is
3   killing him.
4   he is 27. I am 44. I can't seem to
5   get rid of
6   him. his novel keeps coming
7   back. "what do you expect me to do?" he screams
8   "go to New York and pump the hands of the
9   publishers?"
10   "no," I tell him, "but quit your job, go into a
11   small room and do the
12   thing."
13   "but I need ASSURANCE, I need something to
14   go by, some word, some sign!"
15   "some men did not think that way:
16   Van Gogh, Wagner---"
17   "oh hell, Van Gogh had a brother who gave him
18   paints whenever he
19   needed them!"


20   "look," he said, "I'm over at this broad's house today and
21   this guy walks in. a salesman. you know
22   how they talk. drove up in this new
23   car. talked about his vacation. said he went to
24   Frisco---saw /Fidelio/ up there but forgot who
25   wrote it. now this guy is 54 years
26   old. so I told him: ' /Fidelio/ is Beethoven's only
27   opera.' and then I told
28   him: 'you're a jerk!' 'whatcha mean?' he
29   asked. 'I mean, you're a jerk, you're 54 years old and
30   you don't know anything!'"


31   "what happened
32   then?"
33   "I walked out."

[Page 60 ]


34   "you mean you left him there with
35   her?"
36   "yes."


37   "I can't quit my job," he said. "I always have trouble getting a
38   job. I walk in, they look at me, listen to me talk and
39   they think right away, ah ha! he's too /intelligent/ for
40   this job, he won't stay
41   so there's really no sense in hiring
42   him.
43   now, YOU walk into a place and you don't have any trouble:
44   you look like an old wino, you look like a guy who needs a
45   job and they look at you and they think:
46   ah ha!: now here's a guy who really needs work! if we hire
47   him he'll stay a long time and work
48   HARD!"


49   "do any of those people," he asks "know you are a
50   writer, that you write poetry?"
51   "no."
52   "you never talk about
53   it. not even to
54   me! if I hadn't seen you in that magazine I'd
55   have never known."
56   "that's right."
57   "still, I'd like to tell these people that you are a
58   writer!"
59   "don't."
60   "I'd still like to
61   tell them."
62   "why?"
63   "well, they talk about you. they think you are just a
64   horseplayer and a drunk."
65   "I am both of those."
66   "well, they talk about you. you have odd ways. you travel
67   alone.
68   I'm the only friend you
69   have."

[Page 61 ]


70   "yes."
71   "they talk you down. I'd like to defend you. I'd like to tell
72   them you write
73   poetry."
74   "leave it alone. I work here like they
75   do. we're all the same."
76   "well, I'd like to do it for /myself/ then. I want them to know
77   why
78   I travel with
79   you. I speak 7 languages, I know my music---"
80   "forget it."
81   "all right, I'll respect your
82   wishes. but there's something else---"
83   "what?"
84   "I've been thinking about getting a
85   piano. but then I've been thinking about getting a
86   violin too but I can't make up my
87   mind!"
88   "buy a piano."
89   "you think
90   so?"
91   "yes."


92   he walks away
93   thinking about
94   it.


95   I was thinking about it
96   too: I figure he can always come over with his
97   violin and more
98   sad music.

1   in the featherbeds of grander times
2   when Kings could call their shots,
3   I rather imagine on days like this
4   that concubines were sought,
5   or the unspoiled genius
6   or the chopping block.


7   how about a partridge or a grouse
8   or a bound behind the merry hounds?
9   Maybe I'll phone Saroyan in Malibu
10   or eat a slice of toast ...


11   the trees shake down September
12   like dysentery, and churches sit on their
13   corners and wait, and the streetcars are slow,
14   and everywhere
15   birds fly, cats walk, people ruefully
16   exist ...


17   the charmers are gone, the armies have put down
18   their arms, the druid's drunk, the horses have tossed
19   their dice; there are no fires, the phone won't ring,
20   the factory's closed, tenesmus, everything ...


21   I think
22   even the schizomycetes are sleeping;
23   I think
24   the horror of no action is greater
25   than the scorch of pain; death is the
26   barker, but things
27   may get better
28   yet. I'll use the knives for spreading
29   jam, and the gas to warm
30   my greying love.

1   as the wind breaks in from the sea again
2   and the land is marred with riot and disorder
3   be careful with the sabre of choice,
4   remember
5   what may have been noble
6   5 centuries
7   or even 20 years ago
8   is now
9   more often than not
10   wasted action
11   your life runs but once,
12   history has chance after chance
13   to prove men fools.


14   be careful, then, I would say,
15   of any seeming noble
16   deed
17   ideal
18   or action,
19   be for this country or love or Art,
20   be not taken by the nearness of the minute
21   or a beauty or politic
22   that will wilt like a cut flower;
23   love, yes, but not as a task of marriage,
24   and beware bad food and excessive labor;
25   live in a country, you must,
26   but love is not an order
27   either of woman or the land;
28   take your time; and drink as much as is needed
29   in order to maintain continuance,
30   for drink is a form of life
31   wherein the partaker returns to a new chance
32   at life; furthermore, I say,
33   live alone as much as possible;
34   bear children if it happens

[Page 64 ]


35   but try not to bear
36   raising them; engage not in small arguments
37   of hand or voice
38   unless your foe seeks the life of your body
39   or the life of your soul; then,
40   kill, if necessary; and
41   when it comes time to die
42   do not be selfish:
43   consider it inexpensive
44   and where you are going:
45   neither a mark of shame or failure
46   or a call upon sorrow
47   as the wind breaks in from the sea
48   and time goes on
49   flushing your bones with soft peace.

1   I wait in the white rain for knives like your tongue
2   I see the spiral clowns fountain up with myths untrue,
3   I wrestle spasms in the dark on dark stairways
4   while dollar crazy landladies
5   are threaded with the hot needles of sperm,
6   come these morning drunks
7   brushing away sunlight from the eyes like a web,
8   come darling, come gloria patri, come luck,
9   come anything,
10   this is the hot way---
11   points sticking in like armadillos
12   in the rear of a Benedictine mind,
13   and snow snow snow snow snow
14   shovel all the snow upon me I can hold,
15   gingerbread mouth, duck-like dick,
16   raisins for buttons, thread for heart-strings,
17   damned waves of blood caught in them
18   like a minnow in the Tide of Everywhere
19   I wait in the white rain for knives like your tongue,
20   and the trucks go by
21   with bankrupt faces
22   the steam of their essence like foul sweat
23   stale stink death in my socks
24   all the drums of hell
25   cannot awaken a rhythm within me
26   I am gone
27   like an old pale goldfish
28   dead and stiff as aunt Helen
29   looking flat-eyed into the center of my brain
30   and flushed away like any other waste of man,
31   the man-turd, the breath of life,
32   and why we don't go mad as roaches, why not more
33   suicides I'll never know
34   as I wait in the white rain for knives like your tongue,
35   I am done, quite; like any ford that cuts off a river

[Page 66 ]


36   I am done forever and only,
37   this christ-awful waiting on the end of a stale movie,
38   everyone screaming for beauty and victory
39   like children for candy,
40   my hands open
41   unamazed hand
42   unamazed mind
43   unamazed doorsill
44   send your flowers to Shakey Joe
45   or Butternut Carlyle
46   who might trade them to useful purpose
47   before everything, everyone,
48   is dead

1   The landlord walks up and down the hall
2   coughing
3   letting me know he is there,
4   and I've got to sneak
5   in the bottles,
6   I can't walk to the crapper
7   the lights don't work,
8   there are holes in the walls from
9   broken water pipes
10   and the toilet won't flush,
11   and the little jackoff
12   walks up and down
13   out there
14   coughing, coughing,
15   up and down his faded rug
16   he goes,
17   and I can't stand it anymore,
18   /I break out,/
19   I GET him
20   just as he walks by,
21   /"What the hell's wrong?"/
22   he screams,
23   but it's too late,
24   my fist is working against the bone;
25   it's over fast and he falls,
26   withered and wet;
27   I get my suitcase and then
28   I am going down the steps,
29   and there's his wife in the doorway,
30   she's ALWAYS IN THE DOORWAY,
31   they don't have anything to do but
32   stand in doorways and walk up and down the halls,
33   "Good morning, Mr. Bukowski," her face is a mole's face
34   praying for my death, "what---"
35   and I shove her aside,

[Page 68 ]


36   she falls down the porch steps and
37   into a hedge,
38   I hear the branches breaking
39   and I see her half-stuck in there
40   like a blind cow,
41   and then I am going down the street
42   with my suitcase,
43   the sun is fine,
44   and I begin to think about
45   the next place where I'm
46   going to set up, and I hope
47   I can find some decent humans,
48   somebody who can treat me
49   better.

1   there were several hundred fools
2   around the goose who broke her leg
3   trying to decide
4   what to do
5   when the guard walked up
6   and pulled out his cannon
7   and the issue was finished
8   except for a woman
9   who ran out of a hut
10   claiming he'd killed her pet
11   but the guard rubbed his straps
12   and told her
13   kiss my ass,
14   take it to the president;
15   the woman was crying
16   and I cannot stand tears.


17   I folded my canvas
18   and went further down the road:
19   the bastards had ruined
20   my landscape.

1   Bring bring

3   like a horse on fire


4   Ezra said,
5   write it
6   soaz a man on th' West Coast'a
7   Africka culd
8   understand ut;
9   and he proceeded to write the /Cantos/
10   full of dead languages
11   newspaper clippings
12   and love scenes from St. Liz;
13   bring bring
14   straight things: in bird-light,
15   the terror of a mouse,
16   grass-arms great stone heads;
17   and reading Canto 90
18   he put the paper down
19   Ez did (both their eyes were wet)
20   and he told her ...
21   "among the greatest love poems
22   ever written."


23   Ezra, there are many kinds of traitors
24   of which
25   the political are the least,
26   but self-appraisal of
27   poetry and love
28   has proved more fools than

1   a lady in pink sits on her porch
2   in tight capris
3   and her ass is a marvelous thing
4   pink and crouched in the sun
5   her ass is a marvelous thing,
6   and now she rises and claps her hands
7   toward the sea
8   and shouts:
9   TIM, TIM, COME BACK, COME BACK
10   HERE! it is a child in a walker
11   running across the cement
12   looking for butterflies
13   and a way out,
14   and she chases him:
15   TIM, TIM, COME BACK HERE!
16   I watch her butt
17   her pink tight magic butt
18   and it rises in my mind
19   like a Beethoven symphony
20   but she is not mine.
21   I have been quietly reading about
22   the 18th century glass harmonica
23   and somebody else will take the pink wobble
24   to direct hand;
25   but
26   really
27   I've seduced her on this Sunday afternoon
28   and I have seen each movement and crawl
29   of pink flesh beneath pink capris,
30   and she catches her boy in the sun
31   and he laughs back at her
32   already a man on the dare
33   exploring the new front yards of his mind,
34   and he might resent that I have made love
35   to his mother this way

[Page 72 ]


36   as he might resent other things
37   later
38   pink red dawn blood bombs
39   the squealing of sheep
40   the taxis that ride us out,
41   or he might put on a necktie
42   choke out the mind
43   and become like the rest
44   therefore
45   making my pink love
46   upon these black keys
47   wasted.

1   and, I said, you can take your rich aunts and uncles
2   and grandfathers and fathers
3   and all their lousy oil
4   and their seven lakes
5   and their wild turkey
6   and buffalo
7   and the whole state of Texas,
8   meaning, your crow-blasts
9   and your Saturday night boardwalks,
10   and your 2-bit library
11   and your crooked councilmen
12   and your pansy artists---
13   you can take all these
14   and your weekly newspaper
15   and your famous tornadoes,
16   and your filthy floods
17   and all your yowling cats
18   and your subscription to /Time,/
19   and shove them, baby,
20   shove them.


21   I can handle a pick and ax again (I think)
22   and I can pick up
23   25 bucks for a 4-rounder (maybe);
24   sure, I'm 38
25   but a little dye can pinch the gray
26   out of my hair;
27   and I can still write a poem (sometimes),
28   don't forget /that,/ and even if
29   they don't pay off,
30   it's better than waiting for death and oil,
31   and shooting wild turkey,
32   and waiting for the world
33   to begin.

[Page 74 ]




34   all right, bum, she said,
35   get out.


36   what? I said.


37   get out. you've thrown your
38   last tantrum.
39   I'm tired of your damned tantrums:
40   you're always acting like a
41   character in an O'Neill play.


42   but I'm different, baby,
43   I can't help
44   it.


45   you're different, all right!
46   God, how different!
47   don't slam
48   the door
49   when you leave.


50   but, baby, I /love/ your
51   money!


52   you never once said
53   you loved me!


54   what do you want
55   a liar or a
56   lover?


57   you're neither! out, bum,
58   out!


59   ... but baby!


60   /go back to O'Neill!/

[Page 75 ]




61   I went to the door,
62   softly closed it and walked away,
63   thinking: all they want
64   is a wooden Indian
65   to say yes and no
66   and stand over the fire and
67   not raise too much hell;
68   but you're getting to be
69   an old man, kiddo;
70   next time play it closer
71   to the
72   vest.

1   certainly sought: one quiet time,
2   the horses of war
3   shot
4   with their broken legs,
5   air sprayed with the languor
6   of walking through a small neighborhood
7   at 6 p.m.
8   to smell porkchops frying,
9   the arrayed sensibility
10   of men living through light and sound,
11   and rain
12   if there be rain
13   or snow
14   if there be snow,
15   and pain,
16   living through wives and children
17   and the sensibility of fire
18   when it is cold; but
19   the dogs want a part of us,
20   they want all of us,
21   and coming in from the factory
22   to a bug-infected room
23   in East Kansas City
24   is not enough
25   (but who the enemy is
26   we are
27   not quite sure)
28   only
29   this morning
30   combing my hair
31   one eye on the clock,
32   wondering if another drink
33   would do,
34   I
35   think
36   I
37   saw them.

1   imbecile night,
2   corkscrew like a black guitar,
3   the day was heaving hell,
4   and now you come
5   crawling down the drainpipes
6   emptying your bladder
7   all over the place,
8   and I have drunk 9 bottles of beer,
9   a pint of vodka,
10   smoked 18 cigarettes,
11   and still you sit upon me,
12   you march the dead out upon
13   the balcony of my brain;
14   I see shaven eyebrows; lips, slippers;
15   my love, in an old robe, curses,
16   reaches out for me; the
17   Confederate Army runs; Hitler
18   turns a handspring ... then
19   the yowling love of cats
20   saves me, brings me
21   back again ... one more drink,
22   one more smoke, and in the drawer
23   a picture of a day at the beach
24   in 1955 ... god, I was young then,
25   younger anyhow; and at the window,
26   one or 2 lights, the city is dead
27   except for thieves and janitors,
28   and I am almost dead too, so
29   much gone, and I raise the bottle
30   in the center of the room
31   and you are everywhere
32   black imbecile night,
33   you are under my fingernails,
34   in my ears and mouth,
35   and here we stand,

[Page 78 ]


36   you and I, a giant and a midget
37   locked in disorder, and when the
38   first sun comes down showing the spiders
39   at work, caterpillars crawling on razor threads,
40   you will let me go,
41   but now you crawl into the tomb of my bottle,
42   you wink at me and posture, the wallpaper is
43   weak with roses, the spiders dream of
44   gold-filled flies, and I walk the room again,
45   light another cigarette, feeling I really
46   should go mad, but not quite knowing
47   how.

1   don't kid yourself:
2   something kills them all---
3   finally it becomes a matter of
4   dying of one thing or
5   the other---
6   cancer, a new car, sex, warm
7   art, poetry, ballet dancing,
8   a hardware store, smoking grass, peeking
9   out of windows or
10   wiping the ass with
11   cheap toilet
12   paper


13   when Christ began
14   he had the cross in mind
15   all along.


16   if I came down off this one
17   here
18   it would only be to find a
19   better one.


20   meanwhile, sitting with a drink in hand
21   I know, of course,
22   what it's all
23   about, come to the point,
24   dismiss it, forget it,
25   hand to mouth
26   I kid myself a
27   little.

1   that this is the gift
2   and I am ill with it;
3   it has sloshed around my bones
4   and brings me awake to
5   stare at walls.


6   musing often leads to madness,
7   o dog with an
8   old rag doll.


9   into and beyond terror.
10   seriousness will not do,
11   seriousness is gone:
12   we must carve from
13   fresh marble.


14   hell, jack, this is wise-time:
15   we must insist on camouflage,
16   they taught us that;
17   wine come down through
18   staring eye,
19   god coughed alive
20   through the indistinct smoke
21   of verse.


22   the light yellow mamas are gone
23   the garter high on the leg,
24   the charm of 18 is 80.
25   and the kisses,
26   snakes darting liquid silver
27   have stopped:
28   no man lives the magic
29   long.

[Page 81 ]




30   until one morning it catches you;
31   you light the fire,
32   pour a hasty drink
33   as the psyche crawls like a mouse
34   into an empty pantry.


35   if you were El Greco
36   or even a watersnake
37   something could be done.


38   another drink.
39   well, rub your hands
40   and prove you are alive.
41   walk the floor. seriousness
42   will not do.


43   this is the gift,
44   this is the gift ...
45   certainly the charm of dying
46   lies in the fact
47   that very little
48   is lost.

1   It is always best, of course,
2   to push it in right below
3   the heart.


4   Don't try to hit the
5   bull's eye.


6   When seeking damage
7   aim for a large target
8   and strike several times.


9   He who pauses is
10   one damn fool.


11   I remember a discourse
12   with a leper
13   who suggested using
14   hooks and pulleys.


15   Not so. Not so.


16   He was very bitter.


17   It is best to go for the eye,
18   smash the cornea,
19   blind him,
20   then strangle him with rope.


21   My mother suggested an old bathing cap
22   down the throat.

1   my goldfish stares with watery eyes
2   into the hemisphere of my sorrow;
3   upon the thinnest of threads
4   we hang together,
5   hang hang hang
6   in the hangman's noose;
7   I stare into his place and
8   he into mine ...
9   he must have thoughts,
10   can you deny this?
11   he has eyes and hunger
12   and his love too
13   died in January; but he is
14   gold, really gold, and I am grey
15   and it is indecent to search him out,
16   indecent like the burning of peaches
17   or the rape of children,
18   and I turn and look elsewhere,
19   but I know that he is there behind me,
20   one gold goblet of blood,
21   one thing alone
22   hung between the reddest cloud
23   of purgatory
24   and apt. no. 303.

26   that we are the same?

1   she was a short one
2   getting fat and she had once been
3   beautiful and
4   she drank the wine
5   she drank the wine in bed and
6   talked and screamed and cursed at
7   me
8   and i told her
9   please, I need some
10   sleep.


11   ---sleep? sleep? you son of a
12   bitch, you never sleep, you
13   don't need any
14   sleep!


15   I buried her one morning early
16   I carried her down the sides of the Hollywood Hills
17   brambles and rabbits and rocks
18   running in front of me
19   and by the time I'd dug the ditch
20   and stuck her in
21   belly down
22   and put the dirt back on
23   the sun was up and it was warm
24   and the flies were lazy and
25   I could hardly see anything out of my eyes
26   everything was so
27   warm and yellow.


28   I managed to drive home and I got into bed and I
29   slept for 5 days and 4
30   nights.

1   the Chinaman said don't take the hardware
2   and gave me a steak I couldn't cut (except the fat)
3   and there was an ant circling the coffee cup;
4   I left a dime tip and broke out a stick of cancer,
5   and outside I gave an old bum who looked about
6   the way I felt, I gave him a quarter,
7   and then I went up to see the old man
8   strong as steel girders, fit for bombers and blondes,
9   up the green rotten steps that housed rats
10   and past the secretaries showing leg and doing nothing
11   and the old man sat there looking at me
12   through two pairs of glasses and a vacation in Paris,
13   and he said, Kid, I hear you been takin' Marylou out,
14   and I said, just to dinner, boss,
15   and he said, just to dinner, eh? you couldn't hold
16   that broad's pants on with all the rivets on 5th street,
17   and please remember you are a shipping clerk,
18   I am the boss here and I pay these broads and I pay you.
19   yes, sir, I said, and I felt he was going to skip it
20   but he slid my last check across the desk
21   and I took it and walked out
22   past
23   all the lovely legs, the skirts pulled up to the ass,
24   Marylou's ass, Ann's ass, Vicki's ass, all of them,
25   and I went down to the bar
26   and George said whatya gonna do now,
27   and I said go to Russia or Hollywood Park,
28   and I looked up in time to see Marylou come in,
29   the long thin nose, the delicate face, the lips, the legs,
30   the breasts, the music, the talk the love the laughing
31   and she said
32   I quit when I found out
33   and the bastard got down on his knees and cried
34   and kissed the hem of my skirt and offered me money
35   and I

[Page 87 ]


36   walked out
37   and he blubbered like a baby.
38   George, I said, another drink, and I put a quarter in
39   the juke
40   and the sun came out
41   and I looked outside in time to see the old bum
42   with my quarter
43   and a little more luck
44   that had turned into a happy wine-bottle,
45   and a bird even flew by /cheep cheep,/
46   right there on Eastside downtown, no kidding,
47   and the Chinaman came in for a quickie
48   claiming somebody had stolen a spoon and a coffee cup
49   and I leaned over and bit Marylou on the ear
50   and the whole joint rocked with music and freedom
51   and I decided that Russia was too far away
52   and Hollywood Park just close enough.

1   There is this long still knife somehow like a
2   cossack's sword ...


3   and C. writes that Ferlinghetti has written
4   a poem about Castro. well, all the boys
5   are doing poems on Castro now, only
6   Castro's not that good
7   or that bad---just a small horse
8   in a big race.


9   I see this knife on the stove and I move it to
10   the breadboard ...


11   after a while it is time to look around and
12   listen to the engines and wonder if it's
13   raining; after a while writing won't help
14   anymore, and drinking won't help anymore, or
15   even a good piece of ass won't.


16   I see this knife on the breadboard and I move it
17   to the sink ...


18   this wallpaper here: how many years was it here
19   before I arrived? ... this cigarette in my hand
20   it is like a thing itself, like a donkey walking
21   uphill ... somebody took my candle and candle-
22   holder: a lady with red hair and a white face
23   standing near the closet, saying, "Can I have
24   this? can I really have this?"


25   The edge of the knife is not as sharp as it should
26   be ... but the point, the point fascinates, the way
27   they grind it down like that---symmetry, real Art,
28   and I pick up this breadknife and walk into the
29   dining room ...

30   Larsen says we mustn't take ourselves so
31   seriously. Hell, I've been telling him that
32   for 8 years!


33   There is this full length mirror in the hall. I
34   can see myself in it and I look, at last.
35   It hasn't rained in 175 days and it
36   is as quiet as a sleeping peacock. a
37   friend of mine shoots pool in a hall across from
38   the university where he teaches English, and when
39   he gets tired of that, he drags out a .357 magnum
40   and splits the rocks in half BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!
41   while figuring just where the word will fit real
42   good. In front of the mirror I cut swift circles in the
43   air, dividing sides of light. I am hypnotized,
44   unsettled, embarrassed. my nose is pink, my
45   cheeks are pink, my throat is white, the phone
46   rings like a wall sliding down and I answer
47   "Nothing, no, I'm not doing anything ..."


48   it is a dull conversation but it is soon over. I
49   walk to the window and open it. the cars go by
50   and a bird turns on the wire and looks at me. I
51   think 3 centuries ahead, of myself dead that long
52   and life seems very odd ... like a crack of
53   light in a buried tomb.


54   the bird flies away and I walk to the machine and
55   sit down:


56   Dear Willie:


57   I got your letter, everything fine
58   here ...

        Sparrow Press ]


1   I drive my car
2   through a valley
3   where
4   (very oddly)
5   young girls sit on fencerails
6   showing impartial leg and
7   haunch
8   in butterglory sun,
9   young girls painting
10   cows and
11   trees in heat
12   painting
13   old farms that sit like
14   pools of impossibility
15   on unplanted ground,
16   ground as still and insane
17   as the weathervanes
18   stuck northwest
19   in the degenerate air;
20   I drive on
21   with the girls and their brushes and
22   their taffy bodies stuck inside my
23   head like
24   toothache,
25   and I get out
26   much farther down the road
27   walk into a peeling white cafe
28   and am handed water in a glass as
29   thick as a
30   lip, and
31   4 people sit
32   eating,
33   eyes obsessed with molecules of no
34   urgency;
35   I order a veal cutlet and the

[Page 91 ]


36   waitress walks away
37   trussed in white flat linen
38   and I sit and watch and wait
39   so disattached I wish I could
40   cry or curse or break the water glass;
41   instead I pour cream into the
42   coffee
43   I think of the girls and the cows,
44   stir the cream with a damaged and
45   apologetic
46   tinkle
47   then decide
48   not to think or feel anymore
49   that day.

        House Madrigals: Early Selected Poems, 1946-1966 (1988) , Black
        Sparrow Press ]



1   death wants more death, and its webs are full:
2   I remember my father's garage, how child-like
3   I would brush the corpses of flies
4   from the windows they had thought were escape---
5   their sticky, ugly, vibrant bodies
6   shouting like dumb crazy dogs against the glass
7   only to spin and flit
8   in that second larger than hell or heaven
9   onto the edge of the ledge,
10   and then the spider from his dank hole
11   nervous and exposed
12   the puff of body swelling
13   hanging there
14   not really quite knowing,
15   and then /knowing/ ---
16   something sending it down its string,
17   the wet web,
18   toward the weak shield of buzzing,
19   the pulsing;
20   a last desperate moving hair-leg
21   there against the glass
22   there alive in the sun,
23   spun in white;


24   and almost like love:
25   the closing over,
26   the first hushed spider-sucking:
27   filling its sack
28   upon this thing that lived;
29   crouching there upon its back
30   drawing its certain blood
31   as the world goes by outside
32   and my temples scream
33   and I hurl the broom against them:
34   the spider dull with spider-anger

[Page 93 ]


35   still thinking of its prey
36   and waving an amazed broken leg;
37   the fly very still,
38   a dirty speck stranded to straw;
39   I shake the killer loose
40   and he walks lame and peeved
41   towards some dark corner
42   but I intercept his dawdling
43   his crawling like some broken hero,
44   and the straws smash his legs
45   now waving
46   above his head
47   and looking
48   looking for the enemy
49   and somehow valiant,
50   dying without apparent pain
51   simply crawling backward
52   piece by piece
53   leaving nothing there
54   until at last the red gut-sack splashes
55   its secrets,
56   and I run child-like
57   with God's anger a step behind,
58   back to simple sunlight,
59   wondering
60   as the world goes by
61   with curled smile
62   if anyone else
63   saw or sensed my crime.

        Early Selected Poems, 1946-1966 (1988) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   talking of death
2   is like talking of
3   money---
4   we neither know the
5   price or the
6   worth,
7   yet looking down at my hands
8   I can guess
9   a little.


10   man's made for guessing and for
11   failure
12   and woman
13   for the rest.


14   when the time comes
15   I hope I can remember
16   eating a pear.


17   we are sick now
18   with so many dead
19   dogs
20   skulls
21   armies
22   flowers
23   continents.


24   there is a fight---


25   this is it:
26   against the mechanics
27   of the thing.


28   eat a good pear today
29   so tomorrow

31   remember
32   it.

1   in a national magazine of repute
2   (yes, I was reading it)
3   I saw a photograph of lions
4   crossing a street
5   in some village
6   and taking their time;
7   that's the way
8   it should be
9   and some day when
10   they turn out the lights
11   and the whole thing's over,
12   I'll be sitting here
13   in the chalky smoke
14   thinking of those 10 damned
15   (yes, I counted them)
16   lions
17   blocking traffic
18   while the roses bloomed.

        Rooming House Madrigals: Early Selected Poems, 1946-1966 (1988)
        , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   lonely as a dry and used orchard
2   spread over the earth
3   for use and surrender.


4   shot down like an ex-pug selling
5   dailies on the corner.


6   taken by tears like
7   an aging chorus girl
8   who has gotten her last check.


9   a hanky is in order your lord your
10   worship.


11   the blackbirds are rough today
12   like
13   ingrown toenails
14   in an overnight
15   jail---
16   wine wine whine,
17   the blackbirds run around and
18   fly around
19   harping about
20   Spanish melodies and bones.


21   and everywhere is
22   nowhere---
23   the dream is as bad as
24   flapjacks and flat tires:


25   why do we go on
26   with our minds and
27   pockets full of
28   dust
29   like a bad boy just out of

[Page 98 ]


30   school---
31   you tell
32   me,
33   you who were a hero in some
34   revolution
35   you who teach children
36   you who drink with calmness
37   you who own large homes
38   and walk in gardens
39   you who have killed a man and own a
40   beautiful wife
41   you tell me
42   why I am on fire like old dry
43   garbage.


44   we might surely have some interesting
45   correspondence.
46   it will keep the mailman busy.
47   and the butterflies and ants and bridges and
48   cemeteries
49   the rocket-makers and dogs and garage mechanics
50   will still go on a
51   while
52   until we run out of stamps
53   and/or
54   ideas.


55   don't be ashamed of
56   anything; I guess God meant it all
57   like
58   locks on
59   doors.

        Poem-Makers/ [from The Rooming House Madrigals: Early Selected
        Poems, 1946-1966 (1988) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   it is quite easy to appear modern
2   while in reality being the biggest damnfool
3   ever born;
4   I know: I have gotten away with some awful stuff
5   but not nearly such awful pot as I read in the journals;
6   I have an honesty self-born of whores and hospitals
7   that will not allow me to pretend to be
8   something which I am not---
9   which is a double failure: the failure of people
10   in poetry
11   and the failure of people
12   in life.
13   and when you fail in poetry
14   you fail life,
15   and when you fail life
16   you were never born
17   no matter what the statistics
18   or what your mother named you.


19   the grandstands are crowded with the dead
20   screaming for a winner
21   wanting a number to carry them over
22   into living,
23   but it is not as easy as that---
24   just as with the poem:
25   if you are dead
26   you might as well be buried
27   and throw the typewriter away
28   and stop fooling with
29   poems horses women life:
30   you are cluttering up
31   the exits---
32   so get out fast
33   and desist from the
34   precious few
35   pages.

1   I own the ticks on a horse
2   I own his belly and balls
3   I own this
4   the way his eyes roll
5   the way he eats hay
6   and shits and
7   stands up asleep


8   he is mine
9   this machine
10   like a blue train I used to play with
11   when my hands were smaller
12   and my mind better


13   I own this horse,
14   someday I will ride my horse
15   down all the streets
16   past the trees we will go
17   up the mountain
18   down the valley


19   ticks and eyes and balls
20   the both of us
21   we will go to where kings eat
22   dandelions
23   in the giant sea
24   where thinking is not terror
25   where eyes do not go out
26   like Saturday night children


27   the horse I own and the myself I own
28   will become blue and nice and clean
29   again


30   and I will get off and
31   wait for you.

        House Madrigals: Early Selected Poems, 1946-1966 (1988) , Black
        Sparrow Press ]



1   I have lived in England
2   and I have lived in hell,
3   but perhaps there is nothing quite so horrible
4   as picking up the latest literary review
5   filled with the latest literary darlings;
6   K. teaches at L.; M. has a second volume of
7   poems coming out; O. has been published
8   in the leading journals; S. has won a
9   scholarship to Paris---


10   and you hold the pages up
11   to the overhead light
12   and still
13   nothing comes through.


14   it is a puzzle indeed,
15   far more a puzzle than when a 90-to-one shot
16   leaps through at the last moment
17   along the rail.


18   a horse can live.


19   and, indeed, do you expect to find
20   poetry
21   in a poetry review?


22   things are not that
23   simple.

        Rooming House Madrigals: Early Selected Poems, 1946-1966 (1988)
        , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   I have lain in bed all day
2   but I have written one poem
3   and I am up now
4   looking out the window
5   and like a novelist might say
6   /drunk/ : the clouds are coming at me
7   like scullery maids with dishpans
8   in their hands---
9   something that holds gritty dirty
10   water.
11   but I am a drunken non-novelist
12   but in clear condition now
13   here sits the bottle of beer
14   and I am warmly thinking
15   in a kind of foam-shaped idle fancy
16   working closely
17   but all I can stoke up are
18   squares and circles which
19   do not fit; so
20   /messeigneurs/
21   I will tell you the truth:
22   again (in bed)
23   I read another article on D. Thomas &
24   some day I will get lucky and sit around
25   and own a French horn and a tame eagle
26   and I will sit on the porch all day
27   a white porch always in the sun
28   one of those white porches with green
29   vines all around, and
30   I will /read/ about Dylan and D.H. until
31   my eyes fall out of my head for eagle
32   meat and I will play the French horn
33   blind. but even now it gets darker
34   the evening thing into night
35   the bones down here

[Page 103 ]


36   the stars up there
37   somebody rattling the springs in
38   Denver so another pewker can be born.
39   I think everything is a sheet of sun
40   and the best of everything
41   is myself walking through it
42   wondering about the pure /nerve/
43   of the life-thing going on:
44   after the jails the hospitals
45   the factories the good dogs
46   the brainless butterflies.
47   but now I am back at the window
48   there is an opera on the radio
49   and a woman sits in a chair to my left
50   saying over and over again:
51   BRATCH BRATSHT BRAATCHT!
52   and she is holding a book in her hand:
53   /How to Learn Russian Easily./
54   but there is really nothing you can do
55   easily: live or die or accept fame
56   or money or defeat, it's all hard.
57   the opera says this, the dead birds
58   the dead countries the dead loves
59   the man shot because somebody thought
60   he was an elk
61   the elk shot because somebody thought
62   it was an elk.
63   all the pure /nerve/ of going on
64   this woman wanting to speak Russian
65   myself wanting to get drunk
66   but we need something to eat.
67   GRIND CAT GRIND MEAT says
68   the woman in Russian so I figure
69   she's hungry, we haven't eaten
70   in a couple of hours. CLAM
71   BAYONET TURKEY PORK
72   AND PORK she says, and I walk
73   over and put on my pants and

[Page 104 ]


74   I am going out to get something.
75   the forests are far away and I am
76   no good with the bow and arrow
77   and somebody sings on the radio:
78   /"farewell, foolish objects."/
79   and all I can do is walk into a grocery
80   store and pull out a wallet and hope
81   that it's loaded. and this is
82   about how I waste my Sundays.
83   the rest of the week gets better
84   because there is somebody telling
85   me what to do
86   and although it seems madness
87   almost everybody is doing it
88   whatever it is.
89   so now if you will excuse me
90   (she is eating an orange now)
91   I will put on my shoes and shirt
92   and get out of here---it'll
93   be better for
94   all of us.

        [from The Rooming House Madrigals: Early Selected Poems,
        1946-1966 (1988) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   I am a panther shut up and bellowing in
2   cement walls, and I am angry at blue
3   evenings without ventilation
4   and I am angry with you, and it will come
5   like a rose
6   it will come like a man walking through fire
7   it will shine like an unseen trumpet in a trunk
8   the eyes will smell like sausages
9   the feet will have small propellers
10   and I will hold you in Bayonne and
11   the sailors will smile
12   my heart like something cut away from
13   cancer will feel and beat again feel
14   and beat again---but now
15   the blue evening is cinched like old
16   muskets and the dangling sex rope hangs
17   as the tree stands up and calls:
18   /July/ . the dust of hope in the bottom of paper cups
19   along with small spiders that have names like ancient
20   European cities; spit and dross, heavy wheels;
21   oilwells stuck between fish and sucking up the grey gas
22   of love and the palms up on the cliff waving
23   waving in the warm yellow light
24   as I walk into a drugstore to buy toothpaste,
25   rubbers, photographs of frogs, a copy of the latest
26   /Consumer Reports/ (50 cents) for I consume and
27   am consumed and would like to know
28   on this blue evening
29   just which razorblade it would be best for me
30   to use, or maybe I could get a station wagon or buy a
31   stereo or a movie camera, say 8mm, under $55
32   or an electric frying pan ... like the silver head
33   of some god-thing after they drop the bomb /BANG/
34   and the grass gives up and love is a shadow
35   and love is a fishtail weaving through

[Page 106 ]


36   threads that seem eyes but are only what's
37   left of me on the last blue evening after the bands
38   have suicided out, the carnival has left town and
39   they've blown up the Y.W.C.A. like a giant balloon and
40   sent it out to sea full of screaming lovely lonely
41   girls.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /Fleg/ [from The Rooming House Madrigals:
        Early Selected Poems, 1946-1966 (1988) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   Now it's Borodin ... 4:18 a.m.,
2   symphony #2,
3   the gas is on
4   but the masses still sleep
5   except the bastard
6   downstairs
7   who always has the light on
8   all night, he yawns all night
9   and sleeps all day,
10   he's either a madman
11   or a poet; and has an
12   ugly wife,
13   neither of them work
14   and we pass each other
15   on the steps (the wife and I)
16   when we go down
17   to dump our bottles,
18   and I look at his name
19   on the mailbox: /Fleg/
20   God. /No wonder/ . A fleg
21   /never/ sleeps. Some kind
22   of fish-thing waiting
23   for a twist in the sky.
24   but very kind, I must
25   remember, when the
26   drunk women up here
27   scream or throw things
28   Fleg ignores it all,
29   yawns, and this is
30   fine. There used to be
31   an /Anderson,/ a /Chester/
32   /Anderson/ always at my door
33   in his pants
34   and undershirt,
35   red-eyed as a woman

[Page 108 ]


36   who has lost a lover,
37   manager behind his shoulder
38   (and one night 2 cops),
39   "God, I can't /sleep/ .
40   I'm a /working/ man,
41   I've got to get my /sleep/
42   Jesus. I can't SLEEP."


43   Fleg? /Sleep/ ? I've never even
44   /seen/ him. I don't think
45   he does /anything/ . Just some
46   kind of shoulder of mutton
47   with silver eyes
48   looking up at his ceiling,


49   tiredly smiling,
50   saying softly to his
51   ugly wife: "That /Bukowski/
52   up there, he's a kick
53   for sore balls, ain't he?"


54   "Now, Honey, don't talk that way."


55   "He had a colored woman up there
56   the other night. I can tell,
57   I can tell."


58   "Now, Mission, you can't tell no
59   such damn thing."


60   ( /Mission? Mission Fleg/ . Christ.)


61   "Yes, I can. I heard her screaming."


62   "Screaming?"


63   "Well, moaning, kind of like you
64   know. What's this guy look like,
65   baby?"

[Page 109 ]




66   "Passed him today. Face kind of smashed
67   in. A long nose like an ant-eater.
68   Mouth like a monkey. Kind of funny eyes.
69   Never saw eyes like those."


70   It's about 4:38 a.m. Borodin is finished (yeah)
71   not a very long symphony. I turn my radio down
72   and the Flegs I find
73   are listening
74   to the same station.


75   I hope we never meet,
76   I like Fleg the way he is
77   (in my mind)
78   and I'm sure he wants me
79   the way I am
80   (in his mind),
81   and he has just yawned now
82   up through the ceiling
83   his ceiling
84   which is my floor; ah,
85   my /poor tired/ Fleg
86   waiting for me to give
87   him LIFE;
88   he's probably slowly dying of
89   something
90   and I am too,
91   but I'm so glad
92   he doesn't call the police
93   while I'm
94   at it.

1   this South American up here on a Gugg
2   walked in with his whore
3   and she sat on the edge of my bed and
4   crossed her fine legs
5   and I kept looking at her legs
6   and he pulled at his stringy necktie
7   and I had a hangover
8   and he asked me
9   WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE AMERICAN
10   POETS?
11   and I told him I didn't think very much
12   of the American poets
13   and then he went on to ask some other
14   very dull questions
15   (as his whore's legs layed along the side of
16   my brain) like
17   WELL? YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT ANYTHING
18   BUT IF YOU WERE TEACHING A CLASS AND ONE OF THE
19   STUDENTS ASKED YOU WHICH AMERICAN POETS
20   THEY SHOULD READ
21   WHAT WOULD YOU TELL THEM?
22   she crossed her legs as I watched and I thought
23   I could knock him out with one punch
24   rape her in 4 minutes
25   catch a train for L.A.
26   get off in Arizona and walk off into the desert
27   and I couldn't tell him that I would never teach
28   a class
29   that along with not liking American poetry
30   that I didn't like American classes either
31   or the job that they would expect me to
32   do,
33   so I said
34   Whitman, T. S. Eliot, D. H. Lawrence's poems about
35   reptiles and beasts, Auden. and then I

[Page 111 ]


36   realized that Whitman was the only true American,
37   that Eliot was not an American somehow and the
38   others certainly not, and
39   he knew it too
40   he knew that I had fucked up
41   but I made no apologies
42   thought some more about rape
43   I almost loved the woman but I knew that when she walked out
44   that I would never see her again
45   and we shook hands and the Gugg said
46   he'd send me the article when it came out
47   but I knew that he didn't have an article
48   and he knew it too
49   and then he said
50   I will send you some of my poems translated into
51   English
52   and I said fine
53   and I watched them walk out of the place
54   I watched her highheels clack down the tall
55   green steps
56   and then both of them were gone
57   but I kept remembering her dress sliding all over her
58   like a second skin
59   and I was wild with mourning and love and sadness
60   and being a fool unable to
61   communicate
62   anything
63   and I walked in and finished that beer
64   cracked another
65   put on my ragged king's coat
66   and walked out into the New Orleans street
67   and that very night
68   I sat with my friends and acted vile and
69   the ass
70   much mouth and villainy
71   and cruelness
72   and they never
73   knew why.

1   I take the taxi to Newport and study the wrinkles in the
2   driver's skull; all anticipation is gone:
3   defeat has come so often
4   (like rain)
5   that it has assumed more meaning
6   than victory; the player is good at
7   the piano
8   and we wait in a corner
9   (this poet!)
10   waiting to recite
11   poems; it's like a cave here:
12   full of bats and whores
13   and bodiless music
14   moving at the back of the world; my head aches,
15   and seeking a deliberate door
16   I think gently of successful papa Haydn
17   rotting in the rainy garden
18   above copulating
19   tone-deaf gophers ...


20   the sun is in a box somewhere
21   asleep like a cat;
22   the bats flit, a body
23   takes my hand (the one with the drink:
24   the right hand is the drinker)
25   a woman, a horrible
26   damned woman,
27   something alive
28   sits
29   and blinks
30   at me:
31   Hank, it says,
32   they want you up
33   front!
34   fuck 'em, I say, fuck 'em.

[Page 113 ]


35   I have grown quite fat and
36   vulgar (a deliberate death
37   on the kitchen floor) and
38   suddenly I laugh
39   at my excellent condition
40   like some swine of a businessman
41   and I don't even feel
42   like getting up
43   to piss ...


44   Angels,
45   we have grown apart.

1   I once bought a toy rabbit
2   at a department store
3   and now he sits and ponders
4   me with pink sheer eyes:


5   He wants golfballs and glass
6   walls.
7   I want quiet thunder.


8   Our disappointment sits between us.

1   the latest sleeping on my pillow catches
2   window lamplight through the mist of alcohol.


3   I was the whelp, the prude who shook when
4   the wind shook blades of grass the eye could see
5   and
6   you were a
7   convent girl watching the nuns shake loose
8   the Las Cruces sand from God's robes


9   you are
10   yesterday's
11   bouquet so sadly
12   raided, I kiss your poor
13   breasts as my hands reach for love
14   in this cheap Hollywood apartment smelling of
15   bread and gas and misery.


16   we move through remembered routes
17   the same old steps smooth with hundreds of
18   feet, 50 loves, 20 years.
19   and we are granted a very small summer, and
20   then it's
21   winter again
22   and you are moving across the floor
23   some heavy awkward thing
24   and the toilet flushes, a dog barks
25   a car door slams ...
26   it's gotten inescapably away, everything,
27   it seems, and I light a cigarette and
28   await the oldest curse
29   of all.

1   Please keep your icecream hands
2   for the leopard,
3   please keep your knees
4   out of my nuts;
5   if women must love me
6   I ask them also
7   to cook me sauerkraut dinners
8   and leave me time
9   for games of gold
10   in the mind,
11   and time for sleep
12   or scratching
13   or rolling upon my side
14   like any tired bull
15   in any tired meadow.


16   love is not a candle
17   burning down---
18   life is,
19   and love and life are
20   not the same
21   or else
22   love having choice
23   nobody would ever die.


24   which means? which means:
25   let loose a moment
26   your hand upon my center---
27   I've done you well
28   like any scrabby plant
29   upon a mountain, so
30   please be kind enough
31   to die for an hour]
32   or 2,
33   or at least

[Page 117 ]


34   take time
35   to turn the
36   sauerkraut.

        of Nowhere/ [from The Rooming House Madrigals: Early Selected
        Poems, 1946-1966 (1988) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   I don't know, it was raining and I had fallen down
2   somewhere but I seemed to have money so it didn't
3   matter, and I went into the opera to dry off, and it
4   was opening night and everybody was dressed and
5   trying
6   to act very polite and educated but I saw a lot of
7   guys there mean as hell, I don't mean mean enough
8   to be
9   a Dillinger but mean enough to be successful in
10   business and their wives were all tone deaf
11   and even the people hollering in the opera
12   were not enjoying it but hollering because it was the
13   thing to do, like wearing bermudas in the summer, and
14   I thought, I'll never write an opera because they'll
15   walk all over it, and I walked out
16   and phoned a gal I knew from South Philly and she met
17   me on Olvera Street and we went into a fancy place
18   and ate and drank and this big female kept
19   whirling her fans and shaking her ass in my face
20   and the South Philly broad got mad and I laughed
21   and a little Mexican mean as a tarantula
22   kept asking us to keep quiet and I asked him out
23   in the alley and he went and I took him quite
24   easily and I felt like Hemingway and I took the
25   S. Philly broad to my room and I told her all about
26   the opera
27   how the people were so nicely dressed
28   and applauded all the time
29   whether it was good or bad
30   and we slept real good that night
31   the rain coming down on our heads
32   through the open window
33   but I kept thinking of the bigassed Mexican gal
34   with the fans who kept shaking it

[Page 119 ]


35   and I don't think she was kidding
36   because I am real handsome
37   and educated
38   and someday I'm going to give up
39   drinking and smoking and whoring
40   and kneel and pray in the Sunday sunshine
41   while they are killing the beautiful bulls
42   and selling their ears and tails in
43   Tiajuana, and I'm going to the opera,
44   I'm going to the opera and have 12 guys
45   working for me for
46   80 dollars a week, including half-days on
47   Saturdays and no
48   hangovers on
49   Monday.

1   my friend writes of rejection and editors,
2   and how he has visited K. or R. or W.,
3   and am I in /S. #12/ ? he will have a poem in there,
4   and T. has written him from Florida
5   but rejected his poems; R. sleeps in the printshop
6   and T. chided him mercilessly ...
7   met editor of the /X. Review/ in the street,
8   and editor acted like he was kicked in the nuts
9   when he found out who he was
10   and pressed him for opinion of poems;
11   it does good to corner these guys sometime,
12   flush them outa the brush;
13   ad agencies have forgotten him, and W. is taking
14   too long to read his book; only got $5
15   for reading at the Unicorn,
16   phoned K. of the /W. Review,/ sounds like a sharp guy;
17   and he thinks he is done with R.;
18   encloses some clippings for my amusement:
19   his name in a newspaper column;
20   he'll have to call R. again: S. is lecturing at
21   the university
22   and he can't bear to go; M. is a homo,
23   C. can't make up his mind and P. is mad at him
24   because he drank beer in front of N.
25   nothing but rejects but he knows his stuff is good.
26   L. was there to borrow a pack of Pall Malls, bastard makes
27   him sick, always whining ...
28   B. writes that P. is in trouble, they must organize
29   a benefit;
30   awful discouraged. not even money for stamps.
31   dead without stamps. write me, he says,
32   I got the blues.


33   write you? about what, my friend?
34   I'm only interested in
35   poetry.

1   I found a loose cement slab outside the icecream store,
2   tossed it aside and began to dig; the earth was
3   soft and full of worms and soon I was in to my
4   waist, size 36;
5   a crowd gathered but stepped back before my shots
6   of mud,
7   and by the time the police came, I was in below
8   my head,
9   frightening gophers, eels and finding bits of golden
10   inlaid skull,
11   and they asked me, are you looking for oil, treasure,
12   gold, the end of China? are you looking for love, God,
13   a lost key chain? and little girls dripping icecream
14   peered into my darkness, and a psychiatrist came
15   and a
16   college professor and a movie actress in a bikini, and
17   a Russian spy and a French spy and an English spy,
18   and a drama critic and a bill collector and an old
19   girl friend, and they all asked me, what are you
20   looking
21   for? and soon it began to rain ... atomic submarines
22   changed course, Tuesday Weld hid behind a newspaper,
23   Jean-Paul Sartre rolled in his sleep, and my hole
24   filled
25   with water; I came out black as Africa, shooting
26   stars
27   and epitaphs, my pockets full of lovely worms,
28   and they took me to their jail and gave me a shower
29   and a nice cell, rent-free, and even now the people
30   are picketing in my cause, and I have signed
31   contracts to appear on the stage and television,
32   to write a guest column for the local paper and
33   write a book and endorse some products, I have
34   enough money to last me several years at the best

35   hotels, but as soon as I get out of here, I'm gonna
36   find me another loose slab and begin to dig, dig,
37   dig, and this time I'm not coming back... . rain, shine,
38   or bikini, and the reporters keep asking, why did you
39   do it? but I just light my cigarette and smile ...

1   to say great words of kings and life
2   to give equations like a math genius;
3   I sat in on a play by Shakespeare,
4   but the grandeur did not come through;
5   I do not claim to have a good ear
6   or a good soul, but most of Shakespeare
7   laid me dry, I confess,
8   and I went me into a bar
9   where a man with hands like red crabs
10   laid his sick life before me through the fumes,
11   and I grew drunk,
12   mirror upon myself,
13   the age of life like a spider
14   taking last blood from us all,
15   and I knew I had misjudged Shakey,
16   his voice speaking out of the tube of the grave,
17   and the traffic went past
18   I could see it out the door,
19   pieces of things that moved
20   and the red crab hands moved before my face
21   and I took my drink then knocked it over
22   with the back of my hand;
23   and I walked out on the street
24   but nothing got better.

1   exposed to grief too long
2   I become in time
3   surfeited with suffering,
4   decide that I owe myself
5   survival; this is not easy:
6   telling yourself that you
7   deserve better days
8   after the history of your past;
9   but I have seen complete fools
10   go on (of course)
11   without ever
12   considering their shortcomings;
13   then too turtles crawl the
14   land, dirty words scratched
15   on their backs ...
16   but they hardly
17   improve the horizon.

1   would you have me peel an orange and
2   talk of Saavedra (Miguel de) Cervantes?
3   get out! you are like that fly on the
4   curtain.


5   I am not liked in the marketplace.
6   I do not smile at the children.
7   I am not interested in the doings of
8   armies.
9   I drink at fountains until my eyes
10   stick out like ripe berries.
11   I stink under the armpits and do not
12   shine my shoes.
13   I do not own
14   anything.


15   I understand little but my
16   misuse.
17   I understand only horror and
18   more horror.


19   I cannot rhyme.
20   I am too tired to
21   steal.
22   I listen to Segovia
23   smile.
24   I look at a hog's head and
25   am in
26   love.

28   hymenotomy of a
29   man---o
30   sweet things of this time
31   where are you?

32   you must find me now for I am
33   terrified with what I
34   see!


35   the dungeons sweep past lit with
36   eyes. eyes? /magma!/
37   I enter a shop and buy wine from a
38   dead man
39   then walk away under a sky overflowing
40   with pus. the hunters cough
41   on the benches.


42   I walk ...

7   and grocer John gets down

9   his precious eggs

11   and the bats of

1   a farewell thing while breathing
2   was walking down the hall
3   in underwear
4   with painted face like clown
5   a bomb from Cologne in right pocket
6   a /Season in Hell/
7   in the left,
8   stripes of sunset
9   like
10   bass
11   running
12   down
13   his
14   arms,
15   and they found him in the morning
16   dangling in the fire escape
17   window,
18   face frosted and gone as an electric bulb,
19   and the sparrows
20   were in the brush downstairs,
21   and
22   friend,

24   and they
25   (the people, not the sparrows)
26   carried him down the steps

6   the con-men raking it in:

8   the mansions
9   the trips to

11   even the great artists

1   this

3   drink and the life
4   catch up with what is left of
5   one.
6   I still hope to send you the
7   paperback although it is all
8   swollen.


9   I read
10   most of it in the bathroom where the
11   faucets drip hot water and make
12   steam

15   pop

20   here and

22   and I stagger like a deer taking a

24   the face is not what it should
25   be and I tell myself that it does not
26   matter
27   that I
28   am tired of factual and recognized
29   good
30   that we need new goodness new
31   truth for
32   ourselves and

[Page 131 ]


33   let the others wear that
34   out.


35   but anyhow
36   I still hope to mail you the
37   paperback
38   I am sure I will mail it to you
39   sometime I think I will
40   just walk into the room and brush by
41   knock it to the floor with my
42   hand and pick it up
43   without looking at anything
44   and I will find an envelope and

46   you.


47   I want to get it out
48   of here.

1   all up and down the street they came back
2   without arms or legs or eyes or
3   lungs or minds or
4   lives, although
5   the war had been
6   won
7   and the madam stood in the doorway
8   and told me,
9   it won't matter, it'll be
10   business as
11   usual
12   because if they haven't shot off
13   the other parts
14   they'll still want to
15   fuck.


16   and the dead? I
17   asked.


18   the dead are without money or
19   sense.


20   many of the living are the same
21   way? I suggested.


22   yeah, but those we don't
23   serve.


24   God will love
25   you.


26   I'm sure He
27   will.

[Page 133 ]




28   will you serve
29   Him?


30   I have been serving Him, you know
31   that: men are men and
32   soldiers are soldiers and
33   they love to
34   fuck, don't
35   you?


36   amen, I
37   said.

        Early Selected Poems, 1946-1966 (1988) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   ants crawl upon paper flowers with all the insect color
2   of my hatred and
3   I crash out the lamp and rise to scream,
4   but, lo, I am greater than garlic and faster
5   than the foreigner Errico!


6   in the cupboard sits my bottle
7   like a dwarf waiting to scratch out my prayers.
8   I drink and cough like some idiot at a symphony,
9   sunlight and maddened birds are everywhere,
10   the phone rings gamboling its sound
11   against the odds of the crooked sea;
12   I drink deeply and evenly now,
13   I drink to paradise
14   and death
15   and the lie of love.


16   at the window I watch the soldiers parachute down
17   as my radio plays the /Symphonie Fantastique/ by
18   Berlioz;
19   the lightning stills the ants, stiffens them with
20   the fear of man, and there is a knock upon my door.
21   I walk with my luger and turn the knob. everything
22   is nonsense, nothing matters. the flies are upon
23   the sugar, wildly in the small richness: they have
24   my blithe and tinkered soul ...


25   THE MARCH TO THE GALLOWS!


26   I laugh gaily as the chandeliers swing
27   and the last of the lovers
28   clutch at the straws of their lives,
29   and I fire through the doorway
30   as the music sinks to a lisp at the dismay
31   and derangement
32   of Birth.

        (1988) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   a woman walks by and I look at her and know that her
2   existence is
3   depleted of thought and worms
4   that she does not realize that successful men can be such
5   beasts
6   that she does not know that I have fallen into the sloth of
7   formula


8   I watch her as I sit in a dirty kitchen on a dirty
9   afternoon
10   she walks dreaming of oranges and
11   Cadillacs


12   mentally I throw her up into a palm
13   tree
14   physically I rape her
15   spiritually I spit in her
16   eye


17   I realize that really she is no more say than
18   some words written by a small boy in a public
19   crapper


20   these innumerable and astounding
21   realizations
22   this dirty
23   life


24   her skin is white and sagging
25   she has on a purple
26   underslip


27   this is what causes
28   wars
29   great paintings

[Page 136 ]




30   suicides
31   harps
32   geognosy and
33   hermits.

1   there is nothing subtle about dying or
2   dumping garbage, or the spider
3   and this fist full of nickels and
4   the barking of dogs tonight
5   when the beast puffs on beer
6   and moonlight,
7   and asks my name
8   and I hold to the wall
9   not man enough to cry
10   as the city dumps its sorrow
11   in wine bottles and stale kisses,
12   and the handcuffs and crutches and slabs
13   fornicate like mad.

1   if it's raining and you're sitting behind a shade with
2   a cup of curari or a dead
3   antelope
4   with bluer eyes than any of the beautiful blue eyes
5   of any of the girls in this ugly
6   town
7   I'll paint your fence green or
8   unplug your drain for almost
9   nothing;
10   if the fog comes in like soft cleanser
11   and you can see old men looking out at it
12   from behind curtains
13   these warm old men smoking pipes
14   I will tell you stories to make your dreams
15   easier;
16   but if you mutilate me
17   hang me alongside the scarecrow like a
18   cheap Christ
19   and let some schoolboy hang a sign about my
20   throat
21   I'm going to walk your streets of night
22   with a knife
23   in the rain in the snow
24   on gay holidays I'll be there
25   behind you
26   and when I decide finally that we will
27   meet
28   you will not understand
29   because you did not want
30   to
31   and the flowers and the dogs and the
32   cities and the children will not
33   miss you.

1   the most binding labor
2   is
3   trying to make it
4   under a sanctified
5   banner.
6   similarity of intention
7   with others
8   marks the fool from the
9   explorer


10   you can learn this at
11   any
12   poolhall, racetrack, bar
13   university or
14   jail.


15   people run from rain but
16   sit
17   in bathtubs full of
18   water.


19   it is fairly dismal to know that
20   millions of people are worried about
21   the hydrogen bomb
22   yet
23   they are already
24   dead.


25   yet they keep trying to make
26   women
27   money
28   sense.


29   and finally the Great Bartender will lean forward
30   white and pure and strong and mystic

[Page 140 ]

32   enough
33   just when you feel like
34   you're getting
35   started.

        Madrigals: Early Selected Poems, 1946-1966 (1988) , Black
        Sparrow Press ]


1   I was down by the mill at last,
2   and I saw a rabbit go by
3   and a rotten log
4   and a rotten heart,
5   and I sat and smoked on a stump
6   and I watched the ants;
7   the ants are everywhere
8   picking up the dead,
9   their dead and the other dead,
10   cleaning up the earth,
11   and the sky was the same old
12   pale blue
13   like a weak water color,
14   and a couple of clouds,
15   fat and senseless;
16   and I took out the bottle
17   and the notebook
18   and I was a man a thousand years old,
19   and a thousand years back
20   or a thousand years ahead,
21   and I looked down into the oil of water
22   and the sun came back
23   painting blurs in my head,
24   showing me who was master
25   and how weak I was
26   and I put my hand flat on the dirt
27   palm up
28   and the ants came up
29   and touched
30   and passed around
31   so I guessed that I was not dead,
32   but no, there was one,
33   he came up and climbed
34   and I could feel the thin hair-legs
35   as he climbed

[Page 142 ]


36   both of us brilliant in the sunlight,
37   and then down he went into the dirt,
38   and he ran ahead, but the next one ran
39   up my sleeve and then out,
40   and then stood there in my palm, blind,
41   looking up at me, and while he stood there
42   another came up and touched his feelers
43   and they talked about me,
44   and then came a third and a fourth
45   and I felt their excitement:
46   /this palm in the dust could be theirs,/
47   and I rose with a curse
48   and pinched and blew them off
49   like the idiots they were:
50   their time would come to share with the worm,
51   but this time this time was mine!
52   but no matter that I walked off into the pines
53   and frightened a squirrel,
54   they had said,
55   they'd had their say,
56   and I was done.

1   he told me he had all the gas on
2   without flame
3   but when I got there
4   at 11:30 p.m. the gas was flaming and
5   he was drunk on the couch
6   with his ragged goatee:
7   "it got too much," he told me,
8   "I got to thinking
9   and it got too much."


10   which is good enough, we who think
11   or work with words, we who carve
12   can come up against this, especially
13   if we believe our early successes
14   and believe the game is won.


15   I think of Ernie tagging himself
16   when the time was ready
17   and I think of Frost
18   going on,
19   licking the boots of politicians,
20   telling the pretty lies
21   of an addled mind,
22   and I think,
23   well, Ernie's won
24   another round.


25   I pour the kid a drink, then
26   pour myself one. kid?
27   hell, he's 30. a lady's man
28   and a master of the English
29   language with a
30   peanut-shell soul.

[Page 144 ]




31   and I? and I? nothing more.
32   we drink and he reels off
33   petty larcenies. later I leave,
34   both of us alive.


35   the next Sunday, I'm told,
36   my friend was in Frisco
37   in a green bow tie
38   reading his poems to a
39   society of misplaced ladies.


40   I'm told he
41   gassed them to
42   death.

        Sparrow Press ]



1   at 3:30 a.m. in the morning
2   a door opens
3   and feet come down the hall
4   moving a body,
5   and there is a knock
6   and you put down your beer
7   and answer.


8   god damn it, she says,
9   don't you ever sleep?


10   and she walks in
11   her hair in curlers
12   and herself in a silk robe
13   covered with rabbits and birds


14   and she has brought her own bottle
15   to which you splendidly add
16   2 glasses;
17   her husband, she says, is in Florida
18   and her sister sends her money and dresses,
19   and she has been looking for a job
20   for 32 days.


21   you tell her
22   you are a jockey's agent and a
23   writer of jazz and love songs,
24   and after a couple of drinks
25   she doesn't bother to cover
26   her legs
27   with the edge of the robe
28   that keeps falling away.


29   they are not bad legs at all,
30   in fact, very good legs,

[Page 146 ]


31   and soon you are kissing a
32   head full of curlers,


33   and the rabbits are beginning
34   to wink, and Florida is a long way
35   away, and she says we are not strangers
36   really because she has seen me
37   in the hall.


38   and finally
39   there is very little
40   to say.

1   good weather
2   is like
3   good women---
4   it doesn't always happen
5   and when it does
6   it doesn't
7   always last.
8   a man is
9   more stable:
10   if he's bad
11   there's more chance
12   he'll stay that way,
13   or if he's good
14   he might hang
15   on,
16   but a woman
17   is changed forever
18   by
19   children
20   age
21   diet
22   conversation
23   sex
24   the moon
25   the absence or
26   presence of the sun
27   or good times.
28   a woman must be nursed
29   into subsistence
30   by love
31   where a man can become
32   stronger
33   by being hated.

[Page 148 ]


34   I am drinking tonight in Spangler's Bar
35   and I remember the cows
36   I once painted in Art class
37   and they looked good
38   they looked better than anything
39   in here. I am drinking in Spangler's Bar
40   wondering which to love and which
41   to hate, but the rules are gone:
42   I love and hate only
43   myself---
44   the others stand beyond me
45   like oranges dropped from the table
46   and rolling away; it's what I've got to
47   decide:


48   kill myself or
49   love myself?
50   which is the treason?
51   where's the information
52   coming from?


53   books ... like broken glass:
54   I wdn't wipe my ass with 'em
55   yet, it's getting
56   darker, see?


57   (we drink here and speak to
58   each other and seem knowing.)


59   paint the cow with the biggest
60   tits
61   paint the cow with the biggest
62   rump.


63   the bartender slides me a beer
64   it runs down the bar
65   like an Olympic sprinter
66   and the pair of pliers that is my hand

[Page 149 ]


67   stops it, lifts it,
68   golden, dull temptation,
69   I drink and
70   stand there
71   the weather bad for cows
72   but my brush is ready
73   to stroke up
74   the green grass straw eye
75   sadness takes me over
76   and I drink the beer straight down
77   order a shot
78   fast
79   to give me the guts and the love to
80   go
81   on.

        Madrigals: Early Selected Poems, 1946-1966 (1988) , Black
        Sparrow Press ]



1   I keep practicing death
2   and as the worms writhe
3   in agony of waiting
4   I might as well have another
5   drink, and I am thinking
6   I am /there/ :
7   and I cross my legs
8   in the patio of
9   some Mexico City hotel
10   in 1997
11   and the birds come down
12   to pick out my eyes
13   and the birds fly away
14   and I no longer see
15   them.


16   is it shotguns of cancer
17   or sun-madness?


18   the rotting of the heart,
19   the gut, the lily.


20   now there's Hem. I always thought of Hem
21   as a tough old guy frying a steak
22   in some kitchen
23   under a bright light. what
24   happened, Ernie?


25   Hem was practicing too.
26   Everytime he watched a bull die
27   he got ready. when he lit a cigar
28   at four in the afternoon, he
29   got ready.

[Page 151 ]




30   the bulls, the soldiers, the cities
31   the towns ...


32   my sadness, my sadness
33   (let me have this drink)
34   could be strung across guitars
35   everywhere
36   and played for 10 minutes
37   with all the generals bowing
38   whores little girls again
39   maids kissing my photograph
40   on the plaza wall haha
41   and old warriors
42   rubbing their blue stiff veins
43   and hoping for one more day
44   of bravery.


45   I practice for you, death:
46   your wig
47   that dress
48   your eyes
49   these teeth.


50   I too am an old man frying a steak
51   in a small kitchen.


52   when I run out of luck
53   I'll run out of whiskey
54   and when I run out of whiskey
55   the land will not be green,
56   and my love and my sadness ...
57   who needs these?


58   I practice death pretty good:
59   send in the bull
60   send in the girl whose white flesh
61   maddens men on the boulevards,
62   send in Paris,

[Page 152 ]


63   send in a car on the freeway
64   with 6 people going to a picnic,
65   send in the winner of the 8th,
66   send in Palm Beach and all the people
67   on the sand!
68   and I practice for you
69   too,
70   and the man sweeping the sidewalk
71   and the lady in bed with me
72   and the poems of Shakespeare
73   and the elephants
74   and the queers and the murderers,
75   I practice for everybody,
76   but for myself mostly.


77   pouring another drink now
78   at 9:30 in the morning,
79   the Racing Form on the couch,
80   the mailman walking toward me
81   with a loveletter from a lady who
82   doesn't want to die and a letter from the
83   government
84   telling me to give them money;
85   and I practice for the government too,
86   and I'm red, all red inside,
87   punctured with heart and intestine and lung,
88   I hope they don't arrest me,
89   I practice pretty good
90   and I've got a steak, a cigar
91   and a fifth of scotch,
92   I've read most of the classics
93   and I watch the birds fly this morning
94   and I can see most of them,
95   many of them that you can't see,
96   and I'm going to take a bath pretty soon,
97   put on some clean clothes
98   and drive South to the track.

[Page 153 ]


99   it is not an unusual morning except that
100   it is one more,
101   and I want to thank you
102   for listening.

1   justification of blood and rock is

4   justification of gun and club and pincers is
5   justification of you
6   spreading a tablecloth


7   the tree's mathematics is the pounding dull leaves of
8   your eyes


9   my feet pushed into socks is an Arab crawling up to
10   kill


11   juice of christ in a pear is myself driving away
12   at 90 miles an hour


13   and


14   the flak and the gruel and the words are riveted to the
15   walls
16   they are


17   packaged like bombs to explode under my
18   enemies


19   and the evening comes down smiling and humming one
20   more dead tune


21   and


22   it's hooray: look out: wait:

24   life is tall and silver

1   the birds are on fire
2   now
3   out there
4   and I walk across the room
5   and hold back the shade
6   and they are out there now
7   burning at
8   5:05 a.m.---darkness lifting like a
9   horse falling through sand. well,
10   I've got a blazer of whiskey left and
11   there are enough stretchers to carry the dead
12   but
13   not enough water to save the burning
14   birds: and /they/ are telling me now:
15   FLAME! FLAME!
16   FLAME!
17   as old trains move through the
18   desert
19   as the whores sleep with the job
20   done
21   as the schoolboys dream of laborless
22   love
23   the birds BURN and
24   die before me---
25   they
26   fly away done
27   leaving the grass for what's left of the
28   worms what's left of the worms
29   what's left of them
30   for what's left of me:
31   old tin song with lunatic tears:


32   which
33   is nothing new
34   except it's different now

35   feeling so bad
36   they used to call it the blues
37   but it's not so bad
38   whatever you call it
39   because at this time of light
40   say 5:36 a.m.
41   I still have a little whiskey left and
42   therefore a
43   chance.

1   and the sun wields mercy
2   but like a torch carried too high,
3   and the jets whip across its sight
4   and rockets leap like toads,
5   and the boys get out the maps
6   and pin-cushion the moon,
7   old green cheese,
8   no life there but too much on earth:
9   our unwashed India boys
10   crossing their legs, playing pipes,
11   starving with sucked-in bellies,
12   watching the snakes volute
13   like beautiful women in the hungry air;
14   the rockets leap,
15   the rockets leap like hares,
16   clearing clump and dog
17   replacing out-dated bullets;
18   the Chinese still carve
19   in jade, quietly stuffing rice
20   into their hunger, a hunger
21   a thousand years old,
22   their muddy rivers moving with fire
23   and song, barges, houseboats
24   pushed by the drifting poles
25   of waiting without wanting;
26   in Turkey they face the East
27   on their carpets
28   praying to a purple god
29   who smokes and laughs
30   and sticks his fingers in their eyes
31   blinding them, as gods will do;
32   but the rockets are ready: peace is no longer,
33   for some reason, precious;
34   madness drifts like lily pads
35   on a pond, circling senselessly;

[Page 159 ]


36   the painters paint dipping
37   their reds and greens and yellows,
38   poets rhyme their loneliness,
39   musicians starve as always
40   and the novelists miss the mark,
41   but not the pelican, the gull;
42   pelicans dip and dive, rise,
43   shaking shocked half-dead
44   radioactive fish from their beaks;
45   indeed, indeed, the waters wash
46   the rocks with slime; and on Wall St.
47   the market staggers like a lost drunk
48   looking for his key; ah,
49   this will be a good one, by God:
50   it will take us back to the
51   snake, the limpet, or if we're lucky,
52   the catalysis to the
53   sabre-teeth, the winged monkey
54   scrabbling in the pit over bits
55   of helmet, instrument and glass;
56   a lightning crashes across
57   the window and in a million rooms
58   lovers lie entwined and lost
59   and sick as peace;
60   the sky still breaks red and orange for the
61   painters---and for the lovers,
62   flowers open as they have always
63   opened but covered with the thin dust
64   of rocket fuel and mushrooms,
65   poison mushrooms; it's a bad time,
66   a dog-sick time---curtain,
67   act III, standing room only,
68   SOLD OUT, SOLD OUT, SOLD OUT again,
69   by god, by somebody and something,
70   by rockets and generals and
71   leaders, by poets, doctors, comedians,
72   by manufacturers of soup
73   and biscuits, Janus-faced hucksters

[Page 160 ]


74   of their own indexterity;
75   I can see now the coal-slick
76   contaminated fields, a snail or 2,
77   bile, obsidian, a fish or 3
78   in the shallows, an obloquy of our
79   source and our sight ...
80   has this happened before? is history
81   a circle that catches itself by the tail,
82   a dream, a nightmare,
83   a general's dream, a president's dream,
84   a dictator's dream ...
85   can't we awaken?
86   or are the forces of life greater than we?
87   can't we awaken? must we forever,
88   dear friends, die in our sleep?

        Rooming House Madrigals: Early Selected Poems, 1946-1966 (1988)
        , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   pinch-penny light, rifted, pitied light
2   like the drunken face of God in the sand,
3   smiling forgiveness ... some old candle burning
4   in some old house
5   on the last night of earth,
6   house burning,
7   earth burning
8   in tears and poetry
9   scorching the filthy stars.


10   stalwart death, clean-up batter,
11   picking his nose and his victims,
12   old buddy, chewing stale bread,
13   always successful
14   as I listen to the crickets
15   while the master poets snore,
16   as I bring up the walls of China
17   in my poor brain
18   and walk them in wet dark
19   dropping lilies into ponds
20   calling to the dead
21   who have crawled away to hide;
22   while the master poets snore
23   I pay homage to bombs
24   the face of Baune turning to blood
25   with only the eyes holding still to the edge of sunset,
26   not wanting to go down ...


27   now I cling evilly to these walls
28   and stand before a mirror
29   examining my content:
30   I represent rent, cheap labor
31   and nickle-coffee nights,
32   dancer in the splendid hock-shops
33   and rooms that close across the throat

[Page 162 ]


34   as words fly from my small white hands
35   as the master poets snore ...


36   are their birds more silken than mine?
37   perhaps, perhaps ... it is so hard to deny!
38   what trick hikes their wings?
39   I tell you, no sparrow is more carved or
40   craving than mine ... and yet
41   across my window
42   no voice answers, nothing responds;
43   I hear only the electric voices,
44   the shuffling of plates and lives,
45   on and on
46   these same simple dead sounds
47   enfolding me in their unchallenged weight,
48   while the master poets sing
49   and are praised,
50   and even fools love and are loved;
51   faith burns away:
52   I am a beggar hoisting lulled
53   sacked thoughts,
54   knowing I have the bolt to throw
55   but the catcher's out of sight.

1   Beowulf may have killed Grendel and

3   but he
4   couldn't kill this
5   one:
6   it moves around with broken back and
7   eyes of spittle
8   has cancer
9   sweeps with a broom
10   smiles and kills
11   germs germans gladiolas


12   it sits in the bathtub
13   with a piece of soap and
14   reads the newspaper about the
15   Bomb and Vietnam and the freeways
16   and it smiles and then
17   gets out naked
18   doesn't use a towel
19   goes outside
20   and rapes young girls
21   kills them and
22   throws them aside like
23   steakbone


24   it walks into a bedroom and watches
25   lovers fuck
26   it stops the clock at
27   1:30 a.m.
28   it turns a man into a rock while he
29   reads a book


30   the beast
31   spoils candy
32   causes mournful songs to be

[Page 164 ]


33   created
34   makes birds stop
35   flying


36   it even killed Beowulf
37   the brave Beowulf who
38   had killed Grendel and Grendel's
39   mother


40   look
41   even the whores at the bar
42   think about it
43   drink too much and
44   almost
45   forget business.

1   in some suburban cellar
2   a rat rises and tongues the leaky bottom of your life;
3   dreams of Cairo leave the body first,
4   such a November!---sweet pain tickling
5   like a fly, brushed off, it circles back
6   and settles again ...
7   I will not lie: I hear the cackle of the grave
8   on nights that cannot be drunk away,
9   and it has rained all this same day
10   and buying my paper
11   I saw the drops falling
12   from the newsboy's hat
13   to his nose
14   and then falling from his nose ...
15   but I doubt he ever considered
16   cutting his throat,
17   ending a quick love.
18   Ramsey, says a voice on the phone,
19   Ramsey, you sound so damned sad!
20   downstairs a child draws circles in the mud,
21   it has stopped raining.
22   circles, circles
23   weep less, wonder less.


24   I hear a voice singing.
25   I open a window.
26   a dog barks.
27   in Amsterdam a holy man trembles.

1   I am stuck with a snarl,
2   by God,
3   that would walk up the side
4   of a house;
5   I snarl, kissing maidens,
6   50-year-old whores
7   and torn-up mutuel
8   tickets;
9   all affected, I think,
10   as the motorcycle cop
11   writes out his ticket
12   and I think of myself
13   killing him,
14   laying him in the sunlight
15   badge upwards
16   for butterflies
17   and stares;
18   I snarl when I shit
19   or read the
20   stock market quotations;
21   I snarl when it rains,
22   I am almost depraved,
23   seldom laugh,
24   misunderstand flat tires
25   and various things
26   such as
27   human decay of mind and
28   body, spiders at
29   work,
30   all the dead troops of

36   or thirsty,
37   riot for useless
38   causes; stuck elevators,
39   constipation,
40   I understand nothing
41   except maybe
42   falling off a couch
43   drunk;
44   ariel ariel by God,
45   the clown's tin sides
46   thumping,
47   I bring the cigarette
48   close,
49   light it,
50   not setting my hair
51   on fire
52   (I guess this is
53   important);
54   I snarl a bit
55   in case there is Anybody
56   on the stairway,
57   on the roof,
58   on the mountain,
59   pissing from the tower of
60   Pisa (which must be
61   leaned back a bit
62   for ten million dollars)
63   and looking.

1   sterile faces squeezed out from squalid tubes of
2   bodies ream and blind me to any
3   compromise.
4   I would crawl down into the black volcanic gut of a
5   chicken and
6   hide hide hide.
7   listen, I know you think I am bitter and
8   maybe insane, well
9   that's all right
10   but find me a place:


11   a doorman at the casino
12   where I may separate the drunks from their
13   florins

26   most of the
27   time.
28   I mean good
29   stuff not like what
30   I've been
31   getting.
32   I want all
33   silk and garters and flesh and

[Page 171 ]


34   snake wriggle and the
35   diamond earrings and the
36   accent, and the smell of
37   small cotton

48   just a few things.

1   there's no color like the color of an orange,
2   and the mountains were a sad smokey purple like
3   old curtains in some cheap burlesque house;


4   and the small toad sat there
5   holding the dusty road like a tiny tank,
6   and staring,
7   staring like something really definite,
8   a greener living green than any green leaf;
9   and it puffed its sides and let them fall
10   and sometimes through the skin you could see
11   the dark water of another world;
12   and then it shot the blood through one eye---
13   you could see the guts contract
14   gripped by the glove of the skin---and
15   the red-thin stream of frogblood
16   a bright neat trick of centuries
17   hurled through bright valley air
18   upon golden nylon;


19   she screamed and he laughed, delighted with
20   the frog's great victory; she rubbed a quick
21   pink hanky against the desecrated nylon---
22   some womanly female in her had been splashed
23   and unveiled and defeated, and her dress hung
24   like some loose and second skin as the
25   indelicate horror writhed in her and claimed away
26   her fullness;
27   "you fool!" she spit over the stocking, "it's
28   nothing to laugh about!"


29   he looked at the toad in the fine rustbrown road
30   and imagined it smiled at him---
31   and then it turned half-sideways and hopped left
32   without haste

[Page 173 ]


33   and popped again into the air
34   like some slow-motion nature film,
35   the leg-ends seeming to grip for notches in the air
36   and the head humped stiff
37   and brutalized away from life
38   like an old man reading a newspaper;
39   and then, with a backward over-the-shoulder look
40   it hopped into the grass of home;


41   "he's gone," he spoke sadly.
42   he looked to the rocks of the purple mountains
43   and sensed the frog moving toward them,
44   done with cities and roads;
45   he imagined the frog in a stream
46   his green skin happy against the blue-chill water;


47   he took her hand and they moved forward
48   together
49   over the unguarded road.

1   to hell with metric---I have read the lore of the ages
2   and placed them back on their lifeless shelves:
3   we have written ourselves insensible
4   while outside ...
5   to hell with poesy---I would rather sit
6   in cheap burlesque houses
7   and watch the sick Irish and Jewish clowns
8   spill their rank wit
9   into thimble minds.
10   ah, I know the clouds are quicker than we think
11   and that we fail at center,
12   spread outward
13   like so much ink
14   and quickly die;
15   so being a poltroon, I have read the classics,
16   I have argued in the marketplace,
17   I have been drunk with the immortals:
18   I have listened to these children cry
19   that language is too huge a bone for all of us:
20   even the finer wits have dulled their massive teeth.


21   all the waters are wasted
22   on Cadillacs and dahlias,
23   and I am wasted on Milton and matchsticks ...
24   and, tonight, closer to madness than I have ever known,
25   I watch a small yellow bird
26   eat gravel at the bottom of his cage.
27   oh, let me lose my father's face!
28   ... and find a forest all the axmen execrate,
29   let me be fuddled in the glade
30   numb with the growth of fancy;
31   let me find men and dogs and children,
32   let me find towers and lattice swaying
33   in the sun
34   and a God of Life instead of Death.

[Page 178 ]


35   when they deal their sticks against my brain
36   let me see dogs and goats and islands
37   and clasp my hands beneath their might
38   (to hell with your bright wit,
39   with vengeance like a tiger crawls)
40   and flying, flying
41   reach Israel
42   the waters
43   a stone of blue
44   all round in midnight


45   ah, I want too much!
46   bring on your voices, gallant but gall,
47   chill me with garlic and horns
48   and yawn me glibly through the
49   last candle of my hours: I will die
50   witless and poor.

5   caught under rock;
6   words as ridiculous
7   as the equator
8   as pitiful and clumsy
9   as some mongrel dog
10   scratching
11   working away at an itch
12   in the skin;
13   then
14   there are other tools:
15   other ways
16   some shine and some sing
17   and there are some that spin
18   and some that kill,
19   but always,
20   back to the word:
21   it will describe your painting
22   your statue---


23   words
24   to end a fable
25   that no longer itches
26   anywhere


27   now ridiculous but not clumsy
28   pitiful
29   but not wrong.

1   I have refused the discipline
2   of Art and Government and
3   God and all that which
4   destroys my seeming
5   and lifting my beer now
6   frothy
7   in the golden afternoon
8   light
9   I have it:
10   plateaus of softness, wire
11   leaves, spirit of the sidewalks
12   walls that weep like old paintings
13   everything real, not bent,
14   and as a brown sparrow
15   drops across my window's sight
16   and the planes graze Africa again
17   in fire-lit nightmare
18   I have all I need on this tablecloth:
19   sunflower seeds, can opener
20   razor, 2 pencils, bent paper clip
21   memory of sparrow, angular sidewalk---
22   this under my fingers
23   myself myself myself.

1   they get up on their garage roof
2   both of them 80 or 90 years old
3   standing on the slant
4   she wanting to fall really
5   all the way
6   but hacking at the old roofing
7   with a hoe


8   and he
9   more coward
10   on his knees praying for more days
11   gluing chunks of tar
12   his ear listening
13   for more green rain
14   more green rain
15   and he says
16   mama be careful


17   and she says nothing
18   and hacks a hole
19   where a tulip
20   never grew.

1   no more stalling,
2   the war torch is lit
3   and all over the neighborhood
4   men rattle in their irons,
5   flares kite the sky
6   somebody rushes past,
7   a confused cock crows
8   and I strike up
9   a cigarette.


10   it is difficult to decide
11   where the enemy is:


12   I go inside
13   to wife and hound
14   both fat and soft
15   as peaches
16   under the
17   sun.


18   I shave by candlefat and lightning,
19   I shave by their holy silence
20   in a shattered mirror.


21   I put on my hat
22   and hug them both
23   like two jellychildren
24   lost in smoke;
25   then outside I go,
26   searching the West
27   (dim and hilly
28   I'm told)
29   with bright
30   mean eyes.

1   You smoke a cigarette in fury and fall into
2   neutral slumber, to awaken to a dawn of
3   windows and grieving, without trumpets; and
4   somewhere, say, is a fish---all eye and movement---
5   wiggling in water; you could be that
6   fish, you could be there, held in water,
7   you could be the eye, cool and hung,
8   non-human; put on your shoes, put on
9   your pants, boy; not a chance, boy---
10   the fury of the absent air, the scorn of those alike
11   as dead violets; scream, scream, scream
12   like a trumpet, put on your shirt, your
13   tie, boy: grieve is a pretty word like
14   mandolin, and strange like artichoke; grieve is
15   a word and grieve is a way; open the door,
16   boy; go away.

1   the dead do not need
2   aspirin or
3   sorrow,
4   I suppose.


5   but they might need
6   rain.


7   not shoes
8   but a place to
9   walk.


10   not cigarettes,
11   they tell us,
12   but a place to
13   burn.


14   or we're told:
15   space and a place to
16   fly
17   might be the
18   same.


19   the dead don't need
20   me.


21   nor do the
22   living.


23   but the dead might need
24   each
25   other.


26   in fact, the dead might need
27   everything we
28   need

[Page 186 ]


29   and
30   we need so much,
31   if we only knew.
32   what it
33   was.


34   it is
35   probably
36   everything


37   and we will all
38   probably die
39   trying to get
40   it


41   or die


42   because we
43   don't get
44   it.


45   I hope
46   you will understand
47   when I am dead


48   I got
49   as much
50   as
51   possible.

1   fucker, you might at least send me a couple of your
2   books
3   I don't read anymore unless
4   I get them free
5   you write a good letter but then
6   a lot of them write good
7   letters
8   but when it comes to writing the poem
9   they dry up and die like a
10   wax museum.


11   and, baby, I see you've been around:
12   /Evergreen Review, Poetry/ etc.
13   I cannot
14   make these golden outhouses of
15   culture and have long since
16   given up.


17   I will never have a house in the valley with
18   little stone men to water my
19   lawn.


20   as I get older
21   (and I am getting older)
22   I can look at a green gardenhouse
23   (not mine)
24   for hours or I can look at
25   these swinging elephant ears outside the
26   window
27   they are caught between the wind and me and
28   the sinking sun
29   and the sea is 20 miles west and
30   I have not seen the sea for maybe 3
31   years and

[Page 188 ]


32   maybe it's not there anymore and maybe I'm
33   not here, anymore.


34   and the only time I begin to feel
35   is when I drink the yellow beer down so fast and so
36   long that the electric light bulb glows like the
37   sun and my woman looks like a highschool girl with
38   schoolbooks and
39   there is not a dent in the world and
40   Pound has shaved and
41   the bulldog smiles.


42   now,
43   for a cigarette. cancer and I
44   have an understanding like a
45   whore paid for. I haven't been to a
46   charity ward and been slugged to my knees for some
47   time
48   all the stale blood everywhere like
49   puke
50   and I keep thinking that there have been men who
51   died for something or
52   thought they did
53   and so
54   there's this sense of waste
55   just dying for yourself with
56   nobody around
57   not even a nurse
58   just
59   this
60   old man of 80
61   yelling at you down on the floor while you are
62   hemorrhaging,
63   yelling from his bed:
64   "shut up! I want to SLEEP!"


65   well, he'll get his
66   sleep.

1   the chain is on the door
2   the naked women shut out
3   the naked power on as I
4   bend over turbine-powered
5   sun-powered jets
6   knowing that I am not very good at
7   going on---
8   I'd rather watch a beetle crawl the sick
9   powdered dust of

13   my cigar more alive than my

1   grief-tailed fish,
2   Sunday-eye in walking shorts
3   with staff,
4   motorcades in honor of the roots
5   of trees,
6   the rain like a young girl
7   walking toward me,
8   the houses waving like flags
9   filled with drunken hymns,
10   the bulls of Spain
11   the bulls of Spain
12   winning
13   unpracticed as leaves
14   as alone as shrimp upon a sea-bottom
15   or if this is wrong
16   as alone as what is there,
17   as my love
18   an old woman with rouged cheeks
19   skips rope again
20   as Hemingway's fingers live again
21   tough and terrible and good,
22   as Kid Gavilan once again flurries
23   like hyacinths into Spring,
24   I am sad I am sad I am sad
25   that the tongue and teeth will eat us
26   must choose so many good
27   like these fingers of lilies into the brain
28   sock out light
29   to those of us who sit in dark rooms alone
30   on Monday mornings
31   while presidents speak of honor and culture
32   and dedication;
33   or orange moon of moaning
34   that my voice speaks like slivers through a broken
35   face,

[Page 192 ]


36   all this time I've seen through the bottoms of bottles
37   and black oil wells pumping their stinking arms
38   ramming home to the core of a rose
39   split into shares split into dividends
40   that tinkle less than the grunt of a frog,
41   I am hammered home not upon wisdom
42   but upon defamation:
43   old cars in junk yards,
44   old men playing checkers in the park,
45   women putting a price upon the curve of leg and breast,
46   men going to education like a bank account
47   or a high-priced whore to accompany them to a symphony,
48   one-third of the world starving while
49   I am indecent enough to worry about my own death
50   like some monkey engrossed with his flea,
51   I am sad because my manliness chokes me down
52   to the nakedness of revulsion
53   when there is so little time to understand,
54   I am sad because my drink is running low
55   and I must either visit people who drink
56   or go to storekeepers
57   with a poem they will never print,
58   strings of an avant-garde symphony
59   upon my radio,
60   somebody driving a knife through the everywhere cotton
61   but only meaning
62   that he protests dying,
63   and I have seen the dead
64   like figs upon a board
65   and my heart gone bad
66   breaking from the brain and reason
67   left with only
68   the season of
69   love
70   and
71   the question:
72   /why?/
73   that Wagner is dead say

[Page 193 ]


74   is bad enough
75   to me
76   only
77   or that Van Gogh
78   does not see the strings and puddles
79   of this day,
80   this is not so good,
81   or the fact that
82   those I have known to touch
83   I am no longer able to touch;
84   I am a madman who sits in the front row
85   of burlesque shows and musical comedies
86   sucking up the light and song and dance
87   like a child
88   upon the straw of an icecream soda,
89   but I walk outside
90   and the heinous men
91   the steel men
92   who believe in the privacy of a wallet
93   and cement
94   and chosen occasions only
95   Christmas New Year's the 4th of July
96   to attempt to manifest a life
97   that has lain in a drawer like a single glove
98   that is brought out like a fist:
99   too much and too late.
100   I have seen men in North Carolina mountains
101   posing as priests when they had not even
102   become men yet
103   and I have seen men in odd places
104   like bars and jails
105   good men who posed nothing
106   because they knew that posing was false
107   that the blackbird the carnation the dollar bill in the palm
108   the poem for rested people with 30 dollar curtains plus
109   time for flat and meaningless puzzles,
110   they knew the poem the knife
111   the curving blueing cock of Summer

[Page 194 ]


112   that all the love that hands could hold
113   would go would go
114   and that the needs for knicknacks and gestures
115   was done
116   o fire hold me in these rooms
117   o copper kettle boil,
118   the small dogs run the streets,
119   carpenters sneeze,
120   the barber's pole itches
121   to melt in the sun,
122   come o kind wind of black car
123   as I cross Normandy Avenue
124   in a sun gone blue
125   like ruptured filaments of a battered suitcase,
126   to see where you are to see where you have gone
127   I enter the store of a knowing Jew, my friend,
128   and argue for another bottle
129   for him
130   and
131   for me
132   for
133   all
134   of
135   us.

1   the bumblebee
2   is less than a stack of
3   potato chips,
4   and growling and groaning
5   through barbs
6   searchlight shining into eyes,
7   I think of the good whore
8   who wouldn't even
9   take god damn easy money
10   and when you slipped it into her purse
11   she'd find it
12   and slap it back
13   like the worst of insults,
14   but she saved you from the law
15   and your own razor
16   only meant to shave with


17   to find her dead later
18   in a three-dollar-and-fifty-cent-a-week room,
19   stiff as anything can stiffen,
20   never having complained
21   starved and laughing
22   only wanting one more drink
23   and one less man
24   only wanting one small child
25   as any woman would
26   coming across the kitchen floor toward her,
27   everything done up in ribbons and sunshine,


28   and when the man next to the barstool
29   that stood next to mine
30   heard about Liz
31   he said,
32   "Too bad, god damn, she was a fine piece."

[Page 196 ]


33   No wonder a whore is a whore.


34   Liz, I know, and although I'd like to see you
35   now
36   I'm glad
37   you're dead.

1   It isn't easy running through the halls
2   lights out trying to find a door
3   with the jelly law
4   pounding behind you like the dead,
5   then #303 and in, chain on,
6   and now they rattle and roar,
7   then argue gently,
8   then plead,
9   but fortunately
10   the landlord would rather have his door
11   up than me down
12   in jail ...


13   "... he's drunk in there
14   with some woman. I've warned him,
15   I don't allow such things,
16   this is a nice place, this is ..."


17   soon they go away;
18   you'd think I never paid the rent;
19   you'd think they'd allow a man to drink
20   and sit with a woman and watch the sun
21   come up.


22   I uncap the new bottle
23   from the bag and she sits in the corner
24   smoking and coughing
25   like an old Aunt from New Jersey.

1   have you ever been in a room
2   on top of 32 people sleeping
3   on the floors below,
4   only you are not sleeping,
5   you are listening to the engines
6   and horns that never stop,
7   you are thinking of minotaurs,
8   you are thinking of Segovia
9   who practices 5 hours a day
10   or the graves
11   that need no practice,
12   and your feet twist in the sheets
13   and you look down at a hand
14   that could easily belong to a man
15   of 80, and you
16   are on top of 32 people sleeping
17   and you know that most of them
18   will awaken
19   to yawn and eat and empty trash,
20   perhaps defecate,
21   but right now they are yours,
22   riding your minotaurs
23   breathing fiery hailstones of song,
24   or mushroom breathing:
25   skulls flat as coffins,
26   all lovers parted,
27   and you rise and light a cigarette,
28   evidently,
29   still alive.

1   the foreign hands and feet that tear my window shades,
2   the masses that shape before my face and ogle
3   and picture me relegated to their damned cage
4   failed and locked
5   quite finally in;...
6   the fires are preparing the burnt flowers of my hills,
7   the wall-eyed butcher spits
8   and flaunts his blade
9   backed by law, dullness and admiration---
10   how the girls rejoice in him: he has no doubts,
11   he has nothing
12   and it gives him strength
13   like a bell clanging against the defenseless air ...


14   there is no church for me,
15   no sanctuary; no God, no love, no roses to rust;
16   towers are only skeletons of misfit reason,
17   and the sea waits
18   as the land waits,
19   amused and perfect;


20   carefully, I call voices on the phone,
21   measuring their sounds for humanity and laughter;
22   somewhere I am cut off, contact fails;
23   I return the receiver
24   and return also
25   to the hell of my undoing, to the looming
26   larks eating my wallpaper
27   and curving fat and fancy in the bridgework
28   of my tub,
29   and waiting against my will
30   against music and rest and color
31   against the god of my heart
32   where I can feel the undoing of my soul
33   spinning away like a thread
34   on a quickly revolving spool.

9   take them through the streets of
10   evening where Christ
11   forgot to weep
12   as I move down move down
13   to dying
14   behind pulled windowshades
15   like a man who has been gassed or stoned
16   or insulted by the days.


17   there goes a rat stuck with love,
18   there goes a man in dirty underwear,
19   there go bowels like a steam roller,
20   there goes the left guard for Notre Dame in
21   1932, and like Whitman
22   I have these things:


23   I am a face behind a window
24   a toothache
25   an eater of parsley
26   a parallel man staring at ceilings of night
27   a heaver of gas
28   an expeller of poisons
29   smaller than God and not nearly as sure
30   a bleeder when cut

[Page 201 ]


31   a lover when lucky
32   a man when born.


33   there's much more and much less.


34   at 6 o'clock they start coming in like the
35   sea or the evening paper, and like the leaves of the
36   berry bush outside they are a little sadder now,
37   inch by inch now it's speckled with brown and falling leaves,
38   day by day it gets worse like a wart haggled with a pin;
39   my shades are down as the scientists decide how
40   to get to Mars,
41   how to get out of
42   here. it is evening, it is time to eat a pie, it is time for
43   music.


44   Whitman lies there like a sandcrab like a frozen
45   turtle and I get up and walk across
46   the room.

1   So what is a body but a man
2   caught inside
3   for a little while?
4   staring into a mirror,
5   recognizing the vegetable clerk
6   or a design on wallpaper;
7   it is not vanity that seeks reflection
8   but dumb ape wonder;
9   but still the reflection ...
10   movement of arm and muscle, shell-head,
11   a face staring down through the
12   stale dimension of dreams
13   as a Mississippi coed powders her nose
14   and paints a lavender kiss;
15   the phone rings like a plea
16   and the razor breaks through the snow,
17   the dead roses, the dead moths,
18   sunset after sunset,
19   steam and Christ and darkness,
20   one tiny inch of light.

1   the simple misery of survival
2   the tyranny of ancient rules
3   and new deaths,
4   the coming of the beetle-winged
5   enemy
6   chanting, cursing
7   bits of blood and grit;
8   I slam my fingers
9   in the window
10   as the phone rings.
11   I count 9 rings
12   and then it stops;
13   some voice it was
14   to test my reality
15   when I have no reality,
16   when I am water
17   walking around bone
18   in a green room.


19   I would burn the swans
20   in their lake,
21   I would send messengers
22   to the mountaintop
23   to razz the clouds.

1   hey man! somebody yells down to me through my broken
2   window,
3   ya wanna go down to the taco stand?


4   hell, no!
5   I scream from down on the floor.


6   why not? he asks.


7   I yell back, who are you?


8   none of us knows who we are, he states, I just thot maybe you
9   wanted to go down to the taco
10   stand.


11   please go away.


12   no, I'm comin' in.


13   listen, friend, I've got a foot of salami
14   here and the first fink that walks in,
15   he's gonna get it in the side of his
16   head!


17   don't mess with me, he answers, my mother played halfback for
18   St. Purdy High for half-a-year before somebody found her
19   squatting over one of the
20   urinals.


21   oh yeah, well, I've got bugs in my hair, mice and fish in
22   my pockets and Charles Atlas is in my bathroom
23   shining my mirror.


24   with that, he leaves.

[Page 205 ]




25   I get up, brush the beercans off my chest

1   hummingbird make yr mark he said and then something about
2   an arab and a son of a bitch and I hit him in the mouth and
3   we fought in the snow for ten minutes spotting it with red
4   blossoms---breathing is a blade---and I kept thinking of astronauts
5   up there circling the earth like a rowboat around a pond
6   all out of trouble and in trouble, and we finally stopped
7   or somebody or something stopped us and we went into Harry's
8   for a drink and the place was empty and Harry kept looking
9   at us as if he hated us and pretty soon we began to hate him
10   his money, his hate, his hate of us without as much money
11   or as much hate, and my friend threw his glass against Harry's
12   mirror and then he /did/ hate us, and we ran out down the alley
13   and the dogs barked, and the only essence that was left
14   was remembering
15   the time
16   the last time I was asleep
17   and the earth obeyed
18   everything.

1   look at him
2   a withered man


3   sure
4   he's been thru a
5   bit


6   he was under the covers and the house shook with the
7   bombardment


8   he smiled out at
9   us


10   I hope I never get that
11   old


12   a slice of wall shook free and fell across his
13   bed


14   they say he was a tough boy
15   they say he was worth millions


16   sunlight poked thru a hole in the
17   wall
18   sunlight and smoke and a
19   treebranch


20   I had almost finished ripping out the plumbing
21   looking for something valuable
22   but there was nothing
23   left


24   somebody had been there
25   earlier

[Page 208 ]




26   "let's go"


27   when we got to the top of the hill
28   a shell landed right in the middle of where we'd
29   left


30   it was boards flying and him down in there
31   and then a fire came---
32   fast
33   red
34   perfect


35   we went into the woods and Harry threw a rock at a
36   squirrel and
37   missed.

1   how can we endure?
2   how can we talk about roses
3   or Verlaine?
4   this is a hungry band
5   that likes to work and count
6   and knows the special laws,
7   that likes to sit in parks
8   thinking of nothing valuable.


9   this is where the stricken bagpipes blow
10   upon the chalky cliffs
11   where faces go mad as sunburned violets
12   where brooms and ropes and torches fail,
13   squeezing shadows ...
14   where walls come down en masse.


15   tomorrow the bankers set the time
16   to close the gates against our flood
17   and prevaricate the waters;
18   bang, bang the time,
19   remember now
20   the flowers are opening in the wind
21   and it doesn't matter finally

23   when back in our broad land
24   dead again
25   we walk among the dead.

1   The time comes to go deeper
2   into self and the time comes
3   when it is more innocent
4   or easier to die
5   like bombers over
6   Santa Monica,
7   and I remember
8   laying there in the sand,
9   myself 20 years old,
10   reading Faulkner
11   because the name sounded good
12   and being vaguely excited
13   by something
14   that was not myself
15   and closing the book
16   and getting
17   sick of the sea
18   and the sky
19   blue blue blue
20   spots of white,
21   all dizzy in the trap,
22   wanting out

24   I was nailed
25   like the sand-fleas
26   I slapped at,
27   and Mr. Faulkner
28   laying on his side
29   immortal and burning
30   with my toes
31   and everything tilting
32   and not quite
33   true.

1   well
2   it's interesting what does go on,
3   and what doesn't go on
4   that should,
5   and the world's quite a sight
6   spun through spiders and webs
7   that catch us half asleep
8   and do us in
9   before we're even old enough
10   to know we're through


11   if it isn't a whore it's a wife,
12   and if it isn't a wife
13   it's a jam over taxes
14   or bread or liquor,
15   or somebody's slipping it into her
16   while you're down at the shop
17   sweating your nuggets to keep her in silk.


18   or you're on horses or pot
19   or crossword puzzles,
20   or you're on vitamins or Beethoven.


21   but you oughta see
22   what goes on on a 75 foot yacht:
23   it would make you give up
24   liberty and little magazines
25   and Tolstoy
26   to see what beautiful young ladies can do
27   to somebody else.


28   and he doesn't even care,
29   and he'll tell you
30   pouring a short shot,
31   that bitch'd outscrew a rabbit,

[Page 212 ]


32   and unless you've got money
33   by the time you got it figured out
34   you're either so old you're senseless
35   or you're so old you're dead.


36   and there she stands by the rail
37   looking good
38   golden sun and real gold,
39   the fish going by in the largest swimming pool
40   in the world, and she even smiles at you
41   as you go below to get more bottles and boots
42   and to scrape the barnacles from the master;
43   but, ah, you pig!---he told me all you did,
44   as men will do---which is another way of saying
45   you and I ain't living well,
46   or enough.

1   whenever the landlord and landlady get
2   beer-drunk
3   she comes down here and knocks on my door
4   and I go down and drink beer with them.
5   they sing old-time songs and
6   he keeps drinking until
7   he falls over backwards in his chair.
8   then I get up
9   tilt the chair up
10   and then he's back at the table again
11   grabbing at a
12   beercan.


13   the conversation always gets around to
14   Buffalo Bill. they think Buffalo Bill is
15   very funny. so I always ask,
16   what's new with Buffalo Bill?


17   oh, he's in again. they locked him
18   up. they came and got him.


19   why?


20   same thing. only this time it was a
21   woman from the Jehovah's Witness. she
22   rang his bell and was standing there
23   talking to him and he showed her his
24   /thing,/ you know.


25   she came down and told me about it
26   and I asked her, "why did you bother that
27   man? why did you ring his bell? he wasn't
28   doing anything to you!" but no, she had to
29   go and tell the authorities.

[Page 214 ]




30   he phoned me from the jail, "well, I did it
31   again!" "why do you keep doing that?" I
32   asked him. "I dunno," he said, "I dunno
33   what makes me do that!" "you shouldn't do
34   that," I told him. "I know I shouldn't do
35   that," he told me.


36   how many times has he done
37   that?


38   Oh, god, I dunno, 8 or 10 times. he's
39   always doin' it. he's got a good lawyer, tho,
40   he's got a damn good
41   lawyer.


42   who'd you rent his place to?


43   oh, we don't rent his place, we always keep his
44   place for him. we like him. did I tell you about
45   the night he was drunk and out on the lawn
46   naked and an airplane went overhead and he
47   pointed to the lights, all you could see
48   was the taillights and stuff and he pointed to
49   the lights and yelled, "I AM GOD,
50   I PUT THOSE LIGHTS IN THE SKY!"


51   no, you didn't tell me about
52   that.


53   have a beer first and I'll
54   tell you about it.


55   I had a beer
56   first.

1   there is a lady down the hall who paints
2   butterflies and insects
3   and there are little statues in the room,
4   she works with clay
5   and I went in there
6   and sat on the couch and had something to drink,
7   then I noticed
8   one of the statues had his back turned to us,
9   he stood there brooding, poor bastard,
10   and I asked the lady
11   what's wrong with him?
12   and she said, I messed him up,
13   in the front, sort of.
14   I see, I said, and finished my drink,
15   you haven't had too much experience with men.
16   she laughed and brought me another drink.
17   we talked about Klee,
18   the death of cummings,
19   Art, survival and so forth.
20   you ought to know more about men,
21   I told her.
22   I know, she said. do you like me?
23   of course, I told her.
24   she brought me another drink.
25   we talked about Ezra Pound.
26   Van Gogh.
27   all those things.
28   she sat down next to me.
29   I remember she had a small white mustache.
30   she told me I had a good life-flow
31   and was manly.
32   I told her she had nice legs.
33   we talked about Mahler.
34   I don't remember leaving.

[Page 216 ]




35   I saw her a week later
36   and she asked me in.
37   I fixed him, she said.
38   who? I asked.
39   my man in the corner, she told me.


40   good, I said.
41   want to see? she asked
42   sure, I said.
43   she walked to the corner and turned
44   him around.


45   he was fixed, all right


46   my god, it was ME!


47   then I began to laugh and she laughed
48   and the work of Art stood there,
49   a very beautiful thing.

        [from The Rooming House Madrigals: Early Selected Poems,
        1946-1966 (1988) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   I had just won $115 from the headshakers and
2   was naked upon my bed
3   listening to an opera by one of the Italians
4   and had just gotten rid of a very loose lady
5   when there was a knock upon the wood,
6   and since the cops had just raided a month or so ago,
7   I screamed out rather on edge---
8   who the hell is it? what you want, man?
9   I'm your publisher! somebody screamed back,
10   and I hollered, I don't have a publisher,
11   try the place next door, and he screamed back,
12   you're Charles Bukowski, aren't you? and I got up and
13   peeked through the iron grill to make sure it wasn't a cop,
14   and I placed a robe upon my nakedness,
15   kicked a beercan out of the way and bade them enter,
16   an editor and a poet.
17   only one would drink a beer (the editor)
18   so I drank two for the poet and one for myself
19   and they sat there sweating and watching me
20   and I sat there trying to explain
21   that I wasn't really a poet in the ordinary sense,
22   I told them about the stockyards and the slaughterhouse
23   and the racetracks and the conditions of some of our jails,
24   and the editor suddenly pulled five magazines out of a portfolio
25   and tossed them in between the beercans
26   and we talked about /Flowers of Evil,/ Rimbaud, Villon,
27   and what some of the modern poets looked like:
28   J. B. May and Wolf the Hedley are very immaculate, clean
29   fingernails, etc.;
30   I apologized for the beercans, my beard, and everything on the
31   floor
32   and pretty soon everybody was yawning
33   and the editor suddenly stood up and I said,
34   are you leaving?
35   and then the editor and the poet were walking out the door,

[Page 218 ]


36   and then I thought well hell they might not have liked
37   what they saw
38   but I'm not selling beercans and Italian opera and
39   torn stockings under the bed and dirty fingernails,
40   I'm selling rhyme and life and line,
41   and I walked over and cracked a new can of beer
42   and I looked at the five magazines with my name on the cover
43   and wondered what it meant,
44   wondered if we are writing poetry or all huddling in
45   one big tent
46   clasping assholes.

1   whichever way you turn
2   there is gauze and the needle,
3   the back turned to light,
4   scars like valleys
5   scars like pits of terror,
6   and the peach falls to
7   the dirt.


8   the hospitals are the same
9   most grey like old balloons,
10   these sidewalks
11   they are so sweet
12   leading to the beds
13   where they shit upon
14   themselves,
15   my hands again locked,
16   sick twigs of limbs,
17   hurricane here:
18   minds going out
19   like lighthouse lamps


20   hell hell
21   so much sick


22   and they come up to change
23   the sheets, 2 mexican girls
24   without even a sneeze
25   or pause
26   and one of them points at
27   me: "I'll take this one
28   and you take that one
29   and we'll make them well
30   and then we'll
31   all
32   shack-up together!"

[Page 220 ]


33   and they laugh


34   and the clean sheet comes
35   down bringing in the cool
36   air, and I hear them
37   walk away laughing
38   and the trees are filled
39   with fruit, the sun
40   brings gophers peeking
41   from their holes; stones
42   are these which stick in
43   shoes, that pounce upon
44   the hollow head
45   that cannot bleed or
46   kiss; I touch the sheets,
47   I touch the sheets ...

1   I type at a window that faces the street
2   on ground level and
3   if I fall out
4   the worst that can happen is a dirty shirt
5   under a tiny banana tree.


6   as I type people go by
7   mostly women
8   and I sit in my shorts
9   (sometimes without top)
10   and going by they
11   can't be sure I am not entirely
12   naked. so
13   I get these faces
14   which pretend they don't see
15   anything
16   but I think they do:
17   they see me as I
18   sweat over the poem like beating a
19   hog to death
20   as the sun begins to fail over
21   Sunset Blvd.
22   over the motel sign
23   where tired people from Arkansas and Iowa
24   pay too much to sleep while
25   dreaming of movie stars.
26   there is a religionist next door
27   and he plays his radio loud
28   and it seems to have
29   very good volume
30   so I am getting the
31   message.
32   and there's a white cat
33   chewed-up and neurotic
34   who calls 2 or 3 times a day

[Page 222 ]


35   eats and leaves
36   but just looking at him
37   lifts the soul a little
38   like something on strings.
39   and the same young man from the girlie
40   magazine phones and we talk
41   and I get the idea
42   that we each hang up
43   mildly thinking each other
44   somewhat the fool.


45   now the woman calls me to dinner.
46   it's good to have food.
47   when you've starved
48   food always remains a
49   miracle.
50   the rent is a little higher here
51   but so far I've been able to
52   pay it
53   and that's a miracle too
54   like still maybe being sane

56   and old ladies in libraries.
57   there are still
58   small things to do
59   like rip this sheet from the typer

61   stay alive this way.
62   there are lots of curtains waving here
63   and now the woman has walked in
64   she's rocking back and forth
65   in the rocker behind me
66   a bit angry
67   the food is getting cold and
68   I've got to go
69   (she doesn't care that
70   I've got to finish this thing).
71   it's just a poor little neighborhood

[Page 223 ]


72   no place for Art,
73   whatever that is, and
74   I hear sprinklers
75   there's a shopping basket
76   a boy on roller skates.
77   I quit I quit


78   for the miracle of food and
79   maybe nobody ever angry
80   again, this place and
81   all the other places.

1   I keep putting the empties out back but
2   the kids smash them against the
3   wall almost as fast as I can drink them, and
4   old Mr. Sturgeon died and
5   they carried him down the stair and
6   I was in
7   my underwear; the rats ran after
8   him leaping with beautiful tails like the
9   tails of young whores half-drunk on
10   wine; I kept watching the
11   signal change outside and
12   my shoes sitting in the closet and
13   pretty soon people started coming
14   in, talking about death and
15   I watched a billboard advertising beer, and
16   we turned out all the lights and
17   it was dark and
18   somebody lit a cigarette and
19   we all watched the
20   flame; it warmed the
21   room, it put a glow on the walls and
22   there was a flaring concert of
23   liquid voices saying the
24   room is still here, the
25   drawers are
26   still here; Mrs. McDonald will
27   want her rent.


28   that's all they
29   said.


30   soon somebody went out for another bottle and
31   we were thinking of
32   something else.

33   I don't remember what, but
34   the
35   signal kept changing.

19   the best way to explain the meaning
20   of concourse is to forget all about
21   it or any meaning at all
22   is
23   just something that grows or does not

34   when I mowed his lawn twice over

38   the left one, I have a bloodvessel that
39   juts out an inch there now and I
40   picked up the log and threw it into
41   his beautiful roses and limped around
42   and finished the lawn not sweating
43   and 25 years later I buried him. it
44   cost me a grand: he was stronger

1   Winter comes in a lot of places in August,
2   like the railroad yards
3   when we come over the bridge,
4   hundreds of us,
5   workers, like cattle,
6   like Hannibal victorious over the Mountain;
7   Winter comes in Rome, Winter comes in Paris
8   and Miami
9   and we come
10   over the silver bridge,
11   carrying our olive lunch pails
12   with the good fat wives' coffee
13   and 2 bologna sandwiches
14   and oh, just a /tid-bit/ found /somewhere/
15   to warm our gross man-bones
16   and prove to us that love
17   is not clipped out like a coupon;
18   ... here we come,
19   hundreds of us,
20   blank-faced and rough
21   (we /can/ take it, god damn it!)
22   over our silver bridge,
23   smoking our cheap cigars in the grapefruit air;
24   here we come,
25   bulls stamping in cheap cotton,
26   bad boys all;
27   ah hell, we'd rather play the ponies
28   or chance a sunburn at the shore,
29   but we're men, /god damn it,/ men,
30   can't you see?
31   men,
32   coming over our bridge,
33   taking our Rome and our coffee,
34   bitter, brave and
35   numb.

1   folding away my tools with the dead parts of
2   my soul
3   I go to night school, study Art;
4   my teacher is a homosexual who teaches us to
5   make shadows with
6   a 2b pencil (there are five laws of light, and it
7   has only been
8   known for the last 400 years
9   that shadows have a core);
10   there are color wheels,
11   there are scales
12   and there are many deep and futile rules
13   that must never be broken;


14   all about me sit half-talents, and suddenly---
15   I know
16   that there is nothing more incomplete than a
17   half-talent;
18   a man should either be a genius
19   or nothing at all;


20   I would like to tell that homosexual
21   (though I never will)
22   that people who dabble in the Arts
23   are misfits in a misshapen society;
24   the superior man of today is the man
25   of limited feeling
26   whose education consists of
27   ready-made actions and reactions to
28   ready-made situations;


29   but he is more interested in men than ideas,
30   and if I told him that a society which takes
31   its haircuts from characters in comic strips
32   needs more than heavenly guidance,

[Page 230 ]


33   he would say
34   with sweeping and powerful irrelevance
35   that I was a bitter man;


36   so we sit and piddle with charcoal
37   and talk about Picasso
38   and make collages; we are getting ready
39   to do nothing unusual
40   and I alone am angry
41   as I think about the sun clanging against the earth
42   and all the bodies moving
43   but ours;


44   I would bring down the world's stockpile of drowned
45   and mutilated days!
46   I would bring down the beams of sick warehouses
47   I have counted
48   with each year's life!
49   I want trumpets and crowing,
50   I want a red-palmed Beethoven rising from the grave,
51   I want the whir and tang of a simple living orange
52   in a simple living tree;


53   I want you to draw like Mondrian, he says;
54   but I don't want to draw
55   like Mondrian,
56   I want to draw like a sparrow eaten by a cat.

1   the love of the bone
2   where the earth chewed it down, that's
3   what lasts,
4   and I remember sitting on the grass
5   with the negro boy,
6   we were sketching housetops and
7   he said,
8   you're leaving some out,
9   you're cheating,
10   and I walked across the street
11   to the bar
12   and
13   then he came in---
14   you are due back in class
15   at 2, he told me,
16   then he left.


17   class doesn't matter, I thought,
18   nothing matters that we're told,
19   and if I am a fly I'll never know
20   what a lion really is.


21   I sat there until 4:30
22   and when I came out,
23   there he was.


24   Mr. Hutchins liked my
25   sketch, he told me.


26   that was over 20 years
27   ago.


28   I think
29   I saw him the other night.

[Page 232 ]




30   he was a cop in the city jail
31   and he pushed me into
32   a cell.


33   I'm told
34   he doesn't paint
35   any
36   more.

1   I tried all night to sleep
2   but I couldn't sleep
3   and I began drinking
4   around 5:30
5   and reading about Delius
6   and Stravinsky,
7   and soon I heard them getting up
8   all over the building,
9   putting on coffee,
10   flushing toilets,
11   and then the phone rang
12   and she said,
13   "Sam, you haven't been in jail?"
14   "not lately,"
15   I told her,
16   and then she asked where the hell
17   I had been and all that,
18   and finally I got rid of her
19   and pulled up the shades
20   and put my clothes on,
21   and I went down to the coffeeshop
22   and they were all sitting there
23   with bacon and eggs.
24   I had a coffee and went on in.


25   I emptied the baskets and
26   ashtrays, put toilet paper
27   in the women's john
28   and then scattered the compound
29   to sweep. the old man came in
30   and eyed me riding the broom.
31   "you look like hell," he said, and
32   "did you
33   put paper in the ladies' room?"
34   I spit into the compound and

[Page 234 ]


35   nodded. "that package to
36   McGerney's," he said. "12 pints
37   of floor wax ..."
38   "yeah?" I asked.
39   "he says 7 of them pints
40   were broken. did you pack them right?"
41   "yeah."
42   "did you put FRAGILE labels
43   on them."
44   "yeah."
45   "if you run out of FRAGILE
46   labels, let me know."
47   "O.K."
48   "... and be more careful
49   from now on."
50   he went into the office and
51   I swept on toward the back.
52   a few minutes later
53   I heard him laughing with
54   the secretaries.


55   I unlocked the back door, brought in
56   the empty trashcans, sat down and
57   smoked
58   a cigarette. I began to get sleepy
59   at last.


60   one of the secretaries came back
61   rotating her can,
62   pounding her spikes
63   on the cement floor.


64   she handed me a stack of orders
65   to pick and pack, and this look, this
66   smile
67   on her face saying---


68   I don't have to do much work,
69   but you do.

[Page 235 ]


70   then she walked away wobbling,
71   wobbling meat.


72   I put some water in the tape machine
73   and stood there
74   waiting
75   waiting for 5:30.

1   Here without question is the bird-torn design,
2   drunk here in this cellar
3   amongst the flabby washing machines
4   and last year's rusty newspapers;
5   the ages like stone
6   whirl above my head
7   as spiders spin sick webs;
8   I can leech here for years
9   undetected
10   sleeping against the belly of a boiler
11   like some growthless
12   hot yet dead
13   foetus;
14   I lift my bottle like a coronet
15   and sing songs and fables
16   to wash away
17   the fantastic darkness
18   of my breathing;
19   oh, coronet, coronet:
20   sing me no bitterness
21   for I have tasted stone,
22   sing me no child's pouting and hate
23   for I am too old for night;
24   I am with the roots
25   of flowers
26   entwined, entombed
27   sending up my passionate blossoms
28   as a flight of rockets
29   and argument;
30   wine churls my throat,
31   above me
32   feet walk upon my brain,
33   monkies fall from the sky
34   clutching photographs
35   of the planets,

[Page 237 ]


36   but I seek only music
37   and the leisure
38   of my pain; oh, damned coronet:
39   /you are running dry!/
40   ... I fall beneath the spiders,
41   the girders move like threads,
42   and feet come down the stairs,
43   feet come down the stairs, I think,
44   belonging to the golden men
45   who push the buttons
46   of our burning universe.

1   bluewhite birdlight
2   nothing but the motor of sand
3   noticing bits of life:
4   I and fleas and chips of wood,
5   wind sounds, sounds of paper
6   caught with its life flapping,
7   deserted dogs
8   as content as rock,
9   facing rump to sea
10   furred against sun and sensibility,
11   snouting against dead crabs
12   and last night's bottles ...
13   everything dirty, really,
14   really dirty,
15   like back at the hotel,
16   the white jackets and 15 ^¢ tips,
17   the old girls skipping rope
18   not like young neighborhood girls
19   but for room, bottle and trinket,
20   and the hotel sits behind you
21   like grammar school and old wars
22   and you simply roll upon your stomach,
23   skin against warm dirty sand
24   and a dog comes up with his ice-nose
25   against the bottoms of your feet
26   and you howl angry laughter
27   through hangover and forty-year old kisses,
28   through guilty sun and tired wave,
29   through cheap memories that can never be
30   transformed by either literature or love,
31   and the dog pulls back
32   looking upon this stick of a white man
33   with red coal eyes
34   through filtered smoke,
35   and he makes for the shore, the sea,

[Page 239 ]


36   and I get up and chase after him,
37   another hound, I am,
38   and he looks over a round shoulder,
39   frightened, demolished,
40   as our feet cut patterns of life,
41   dog-life, man-life,
42   lazy indolent life, gull-life
43   and running, and the sharks
44   out beyond the rocks
45   thrashing for our silly blood.

5   fire power
6   big teeth and

8   a colored man
9   with cigar

17   a fetid white obscene
18   thing---
19   the old man
20   lifts apart some purple flowers
21   and peeks through the fence at the
22   orange animal


23   and like a horror movie
24   I see the orange animal open its
25   mouth---
26   it belches it has teeth fastened onto a giraffe's
27   neck---
28   and it reached over the fence and it gets the
29   old man in his blue
30   bathing trunks

[Page 241 ]




31   neatly
32   it gets him
33   from behind the fence of purple flowers
34   and his whiteness is like
35   garbage in the air
36   and then
37   he's dumped into a
38   shock of lumber


39   and then the orange animal
40   backs off
41   spins
42   turns
43   runs off into the Hollywood Hills
44   the palm trees the
45   boulevards as


46   the colored man
47   sucks red steam
48   from his
49   cigar


50   I'll be glad when it's all

1   they live down by the sea ... these men
2   and you see them going to the gray public bath
3   like colonels on parade;
4   they have trailers and dogs and wives and children
5   in that importance; they crawl upon the rocks
6   as turtles do and dream sun-dreams
7   turtle-dreams
8   that do not hurt;
9   ---or you see them singly ... standing with their poles
10   the sea climbing their ankles and ignored like some
11   useless oil
12   and their long lines search and wait beyond the breakers,
13   a vein from life to life and calm brisk death.


14   I have never seen their fish, or their gods
15   or the color of their eyes---though I imagine
16   the palest shade of pink,
17   like small-sweet pickled onions, and their bellies
18   like the bellies of jellyfish hiding in flowers
19   beneath the rock.


20   they are there all year, I'm told ... these same men
21   with their rusty lives. when it rains the sand gets wet,
22   not as bad as mud, and they never die: you see
23   their fires at night as you drive back from the track,
24   nothing moving except the flame a little and the sea
25   changing shape, and you can see the threads of smoke
26   easing into the sky;
27   and as their camp goes by, leaving you vacant
28   you stare again into a world of red tail lights
29   and turn on the radio
30   and through the glass like the hand of some
31   forgotten god
32   you watch
33   a gull dip over your car
34   and then rise and fly out toward the sea.

        , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   practically speaking
2   the great words of great men
3   are not so great.


4   nor do great nations nor great beauties
5   leave anything but the residue
6   of reputation to be slowly
7   gnawed away.


8   nor do great wars seem so great,
9   nor great poems
10   nor first-hand legends.


11   even the sad deaths
12   are not now so sad,
13   and failure was nothing but a
14   trick
15   to keep us going,


16   and fame and love
17   a trick to dull our bleeding.


18   and as fire becomes ash and steel
19   becomes rust, we become
20   wise
21   and then
22   not so wise.


23   and we sit in chairs
24   reading old maps,
25   wars done, loves done, lives done,


26   and a child plays before us like a monkey

[Page 246 ]


27   and we tap our pipe and yawn,
28   close our eyes and sleep.


29   pretty words
30   like pretty ladies,
31   wrinkle up and die.

        Madrigals: Early Selected Poems, 1946-1966 (1988) , Black
        Sparrow Press ]



1   rose, rose
2   bark for me


3   all these centuries in the sun
4   you have heard men sing
5   to break like the stems that held you


6   you have sat in the hair of young girls
7   like roses themselves, feeling like roses,
8   and you know, you know what happened


9   I gave roses to a lady once and she put them
10   on her dresser and hugged them and smelled them
11   and now the lady is gone and the roses are gone
12   but the dresser is there, I see the dresser
13   and on the boulevards I see you again


14   alive again! yes!
15   and, I am still
16   alive.


17   rose, rose
18   bark for me


19   walking last night
20   feeling my flesh fat about my girth
21   old dreams faint as fireflies
22   I came upon a flower
23   and like a giant god gone mad
24   yanked off its head
25   and then put the petals in my pocket
26   feeling and tearing
27   soft insides, ha so!---
28   like defiling a virgin.

[Page 248 ]




29   she hugged you, she loved you
30   and she died, and


31   in my room, hand out of pocket,
32   the first night's drink, and
33   along the edge of the glass,
34   the same same scarlet
35   virgin and thorn, my hand
36   my hand my hand; bark, rose
37   teeth of centuries blooming
38   in the sun, vast god damned
39   god pulling these poems out
40   of my head.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /Spain Sits Like a Hidden Flower in My
        Coffeepot/ [from The Rooming House Madrigals: Early Selected
        Poems, 1946-1966 (1988) , Black Sparrow Press ]




1   it is like tanks come through Hungary and
2   I am looking for matchsticks to
3   build a soul


4   it is the hunger of the intestine
5   and feeling sorry for a
6   radio dropped and broken last Tuesday night


7   Gertrude knows what is left of me
8   but she can hardly boil an egg and
9   she can't boil me
10   or put me together like
11   matchsticks
12   but some day I must send you
13   some of her poems or
14   her old shoe once worn by a
15   duchess


16   there isn't anybody on the street now
17   the street is empty and
18   Spain sits like a hidden flower
19   in my coffeepot as
20   the audience applauds the bones of
21   Vivaldi


22   and I could go on
23   tossing phrases like
24   burning candles
25   but I leave that to the
26   acrobats


27   a loaf of bread
28   dog bark
29   babycry

[Page 250 ]


30   the matchless failure of
31   bright things


32   her leaning forward
33   over a cup of tea
34   telling me---
35   you are a kind man
36   you are a very kind
37   man

                    




38   the eyes believing dynasties of softness
39   the hands touching my neck
40   the cars going by


41   the snails sleeping with pictures of Christ


42   I phrase the ending like hatchets
43   or a bush burned down
44   and kiss a staring
45   greenblue
46   eye


47   greenblue eye
48   like faded drapes the light burned through


49   and my god
50   another woman another night
51   going on


52   the rats are thimbles in cats' paws when it
53   rains in Miami
54   and the fence falls down


55   the world is on its back
56   legs lifted
57   and I enter again

[Page 251 ]




58   into the
59   sweat and stink and torture---
60   a very kind man
61   gentle as a knife


62   the brilliant hush of parrots


63   Gertrude lives in a place by the freeway
64   and I live here---
65   the mice the garbage the lack of air
66   the gallantry


67   and
68   outside of here:
69   young girls skipping rope
70   strong enough to hang the men
71   now nowhere
72   about


73   me?:
74   I dreamed I drank an Arrow shirt
75   and stole a broken
76   pail.

        Sparrow Press ]



1   As my skin wrinkles in warning like
2   paint on a burning wall
3   fruitflies with sterile
4   orange-grey
5   eyes
6   stare at me
7   while I dream of lavender ladies as impossible
8   and beautiful as
9   immortality


10   as my skin wrinkles in warning
11   I read /The New York Times/
12   while spiders wrestle with ants in shaded roots
13   of grass
14   and whores lift their hands to heaven for
15   love
16   while the white mice
17   huddle in controversy over a
18   piece of cheese


19   as my skin wrinkles in warning
20   I think of Carthage and Rome and
21   Berlin
22   I think of young girls crossing their
23   nylon legs at bus stops


24   as my skin wrinkles in warning like
25   paint on a burning wall
26   I get up from my chair to drink water
27   on a pleasant afternoon
28   and I wonder about water
29   I wonder about me,
30   a warm thermometer kind of wonderment
31   that rises like a butterfly
32   in a distilled pale yellow afternoon

[Page 253 ]


33   and then I walk back out
34   and sit on my chair
35   and don't think anymore---
36   as to the strain of broken ladders and old war
37   movies---
38   I let everything
39   burn.

1   maybe I'll win the Irish Sweepstakes
2   maybe I'll go nuts
3   maybe
4   maybe unemployment insurance or
5   a rich lesbian at the top of a hill


6   maybe re-incarnation as a frog ...
7   or $70,000 found floating in a plastic sack
8   in the bathtub


9   I need help
10   I am a fat man being eaten by
11   green trees
12   butterflies and
13   you


14   turn turn
15   light the lamp
16   my teeth ache the teeth of my soul ache
17   I can't sleep I
18   pray for the dead streetcars
19   the white mice
20   engines on fire
21   blood on a green gown in an operating room in
22   San Francisco
23   and I am caught
24   ow ow
25   wild: my body being there filled with nothing but
26   me
27   me caught halfway between suicide and
28   old age
29   hustling in factories next to the
30   young boys
31   keeping pace
32   burning my blood like gasoline and

[Page 255 ]


33   making the foreman
34   grin


35   my poems are only scratchings
36   on the floor of a
37   cage.

1   a rose
2   red sunlight;
3   I take it apart
4   in the garage
5   like a puzzle:
6   the petals are as greasy
7   as old bacon
8   and fall
9   like the maidens of the world
10   backs to floor
11   and I look up
12   at the old calendar
13   hung from a nail
14   and touch
15   my wrinkled face
16   and smile
17   because
18   the secret
19   is beyond me.

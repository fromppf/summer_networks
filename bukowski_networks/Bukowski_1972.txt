        Bukowski, Charles :  /a free 25 page booklet/ [from Mockingbird
        Wish Me Luck (1972) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   dying for a beer dying
2   for and of life
3   on a windy afternoon in Hollywood
4   listening to symphony music from my little red radio
5   on the floor.


6   a friend said,
7   "all ya gotta do is go out on the sidewalk
8   and lay down
9   somebody will pick you up
10   somebody will take care of you."


11   I look out the window at the sidewalk
12   I see something walking on the sidewalk
13   she wouldn't lay down there,
14   only in special places for special people with special $$$$
15   and
16   special ways
17   while I am dying for a beer on a windy afternoon in
18   Hollywood,
19   nothing like a beautiful broad dragging it past you on the
20   sidewalk
21   moving it past your famished window
22   she's dressed in the finest cloth
23   she doesn't care what you say
24   how you look what you do
25   as long as you do not get in her
26   way, and it must be that she doesn't shit or
27   have blood
28   she must be a cloud, friend, the way she floats past us.


29   I am too sick to lay down
30   the sidewalks frighten me
31   the whole damned city frightens me,
32   what I will become
33   what I have become
34   frightens me.

[Page 12 ]




35   ah, the bravado is gone
36   the big run through center is gone
37   on a windy afternoon in Hollywood
38   my radio cracks and spits its dirty music
39   through a floor full of empty beerbottles.


40   now I hear a siren
41   it comes closer
42   the music stops
43   the man on the radio says,
44   "we will send you a free 25 page booklet:
45   FACE THE FACTS ABOUT COLLEGE COSTS."


46   the siren fades into the cardboard mountains
47   and I look out the window again as the clasped fist of
48   boiling cloud comes down---
49   the wind shakes the plants outside
50   I wait for evening I wait for night I wait sitting in a chair
51   by the window---
52   the cook drops in the live
53   red-pink salty
54   rough-tit crab and
55   the game works
56   on


57   come get me.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /the smoking car/ [from Mockingbird Wish Me
        Luck (1972) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   they stop out front here
2   it looks as if the car is on fire
3   the smoke blazes blue from the hood and exhaust
4   the motor sounds like cannon shots
5   the car humps wildly
6   one guy gets out,
7   Jesus, he says, he takes a long drink from a
8   canvas water bag
9   and gives the car an eerie look.
10   the other guy gets out and looks at the car,
11   Jesus, he says,
12   and he takes a drink from a pint of whiskey,
13   then passes the bottle to his
14   friend.
15   they both stand and look at the car,
16   one holding the whiskey, the other the water bag.
17   they are not dressed in conventional hippie garb
18   but in natural old clothes
19   faded, dirty and torn.
20   a butterfly goes past my window
21   and they get back in the
22   car
23   and it bucks off in low
24   like a rodeo bronc
25   they are both laughing
26   and one has the bottle
27   tilted ...


28   the butterfly is gone
29   and outside there is a globe of smoke
30   40 feet in circumference.


31   first human beings I've seen in Los Angeles
32   in 15 years.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /the world's greatest loser/ [from
        Mockingbird Wish Me Luck (1972) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   he used to sell papers in front:
2   "Get your winners! Get rich on a dime!"
3   and about the 3rd or 4th race
4   you'd see him rolling in on his rotten board
5   with roller skates underneath.
6   he'd propel himself along on his hands;
7   he just had small stumps for legs
8   and the rims of the skate wheels were worn off.
9   you could see inside the wheels and they would wobble
10   something awful
11   shooting and flashing
12   imperialistic sparks!
13   he moved faster than anybody, rolled cigarette dangling,
14   you could hear him coming
15   "god o mighty, what was that?" the new ones asked.


16   he was the world's greatest loser
17   but he never gave up
18   wheeling toward the 2 dollar window screaming:
19   "IT'S THE 4 HORSE, YOU FOOLS! HOW THE HELL YA
20   GONNA BEAT THE
21   4?"
22   up on the board the 4 would be reading
23   60 to one.
24   I never heard him pick a winner.


25   they say he slept in the bushes. I guess that's where he
26   died. he's not around any
27   more.


28   there was the big fat blonde whore
29   who kept touching him for luck, and
30   laughing.


31   nobody had any luck. the whore is gone
32   too.


33   I guess nothing ever works for us. we're fools, of course---

[Page 15 ]


34   bucking the inside plus a 15 percent take,
35   but how are you going to tell a dreamer
36   there's a 15 percent take on the
37   dream? he'll just laugh and say,
38   is that all?


39   I miss those
40   sparks.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /the garbageman/ [from Mockingbird Wish Me
        Luck (1972) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   we do not accept unsolicited manuscripts
2   the garbageman said
3   dropping to one knee
4   and blowing the head away from the priest's
5   neck
6   and as the green bus stopped at the corner
7   a cripple got out and a witch and a little girl
8   with a flower.
9   we do not accept unsolicited manuscripts
10   the garbageman said
11   and he shot the cripple and the witch
12   but did not fire at the little girl,
13   then he ran down an alley
14   and climbed up on the roof of a garage,
15   reloaded
16   as the Goodyear Blimp sailed overhead
17   he pumped 6 shots, saying,
18   here are some unsolicited manuscripts,
19   and the blimp wavered, paused,
20   then began to nose down as 2 men parachuted
21   out
22   saying Hail Marys.
23   8 squad cars entered the area
24   and began to surround the garage
25   and the garbageman said,
26   we do not accept unsolicited manuscripts
27   and he got one cop,
28   and then they really began firing.
29   the garbageman stood up in the center of the sky,
30   threw his loaded rifle at them
31   and all the shells
32   and he said,
33   we do not accept unsolicited manuscripts,
34   and the first bullet got him in the chest,
35   spun him,
36   another in the back, one in the neck, and
37   he fell on top of the garage roof,
38   the blood rolling out on the tarpaper,
39   blood like syrup blood like honey blood like blood,
40   he said,
41   Holy Mary, we do not accept ...

        Bukowski, Charles :  /girl in a miniskirt reading the bible
        outside my window/ [from Mockingbird Wish Me Luck (1972) , Black
        Sparrow Press ]



1   Sunday. I am eating a
2   grapefruit. church is over at the Russian
3   Orthodox to the
4   west.
5   she is dark
6   of Eastern descent,
7   large brown eyes look up from the Bible
8   then down. a small red and black
9   Bible, and as she reads
10   her legs keep moving, moving,
11   she is doing a slow rhythmic dance
12   reading the Bible ...
13   long gold earrings;
14   2 gold bracelets on each arm,
15   and it's a mini- /suit/ , I suppose,
16   the cloth hugs her body,
17   the lightest of tans is that cloth,
18   she twists this way and that,
19   long young legs warm in the sun ...


20   there is no escaping her being
21   there is no desire to ...
22   my radio is playing symphonic music
23   that she cannot hear
24   but her movements coincide /exactly/
25   to the rhythms of the
26   symphony ...


27   she is dark, she is dark
28   she is reading about God.


29   I am God.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /moyamensing prison:/ [from Mockingbird
        Wish Me Luck (1972) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   we shot craps in the exercise yard while the
2   dummies played ball with a torn-up shirt
3   wound into a ball
4   once or twice a day we had to break it up
5   under a tommy gun from the tower---
6   some blank-faced screw pointing it at
7   us, but,
8   by god, through it we somehow played
9   and through some skill and
10   luck
11   I soon had all the money in the yard.
12   and in the morning and in the days that followed---
13   the screws, the sparrows, the shivs, the dips, the
14   strongarms, the looneys, the hustlers, the freaks,
15   the discarded dream-presidents of America, the cook,
16   in fact, all my critics, they all called me
17   "Mr. Bukowski," a kind of fleeting immortality
18   I guess,
19   but real as hogs' heads or dead flowers,
20   and the force of it
21   got to me there:
22   "Mr. Bukowski," ace-crapshooter,
23   money-man in a world of almost no
24   money.
25   immortality.
26   I didn't recite them Shelley, no,
27   and everything came to me after lights out:
28   slim-hipped boys I didn't want
29   steaks and ice cream and cigars which I did
30   want, and
31   shaving cream, new razorblades, the latest copy of the
32   /New Yorker./
33   what greater immortality than Heaven in Hell,
34   and I continued to enjoy it until they
35   threw me out on the streets
36   back to my typewriter,
37   innocent, lazy, frightened and mortal
38   again.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /notes upon the flaxen aspect:/ [from
        Mockingbird Wish Me Luck (1972) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   a John F. Kennedy flower knocks upon my door and is
2   shot through the neck;
3   the gladiolas gather by the dozens around the tip of
4   India
5   dripping into Ceylon;
6   dozens of oysters read Germaine Greer.


7   meanwhile, I itch from the slush of the Philippines
8   to the eye of the minnow
9   the minnow being eaten by the cumulative dreams of
10   Simon Bolivar. O,
11   freedom from the limitation of angular distance would be
12   delicious.
13   war is perfect,
14   the solid way drips and leaks,
15   Schopenhauer laughed for 72 years,
16   and I was told by a very small man in a New York City
17   pawnshop
18   one afternoon:
19   "Christ got more attention than I did
20   but I went further on less ..."


21   well, the distance between 5 points is the same as the
22   distance between 3 points is the same as the distance
23   between one point:


24   it is all as cordial as a bonbon:
25   all this that we are wrapped
26   in:


27   eunuchs are more exact than sleep


28   the postage stamp is mad, Indiana is ridiculous


29   the chameleon is the last walking flower.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /funhouse/ [from Mockingbird Wish Me Luck
        (1972) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I drive to the beach at night
2   in the winter
3   and sit and look at the burned-down amusement pier
4   wonder why they just let it sit there
5   in the water.
6   I want it out of there,
7   blown-up,
8   vanished,
9   erased:
10   that pier should no longer sit there
11   with madmen sleeping inside
12   the burned-out guts of the funhouse ...
13   it's awful, I say, blow the damn thing up,
14   get it out of my eyes,
15   that tombstone in the sea.


16   the madmen can find other holes
17   to crawl into.
18   I used to walk that pier when I was 8
19   years old.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /another academy/ [from Mockingbird Wish Me
        Luck (1972) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   how can they go on, you see them
2   sitting in old doorways
3   with dirty stained caps and thick clothes and
4   no place to go;
5   heads bent down, arms on
6   knees they wait.
7   or they stand in front of the Mission
8   700 of them
9   quiet as oxen
10   waiting to be let into the chapel
11   where they will sleep upright on the hard benches
12   leaning against each other
13   snoring and
14   dreaming;
15   men
16   without.


17   in New York City
18   where it gets colder
19   and they are hunted by their own
20   kind, these men often crawl under car radiators,
21   drink the anti-freeze,
22   get warm and grateful for some minutes, then
23   die.


24   but that is an older
25   culture and a wiser
26   one;
27   here they scratch and
28   wait,
29   while on Sunset Boulevard the
30   hippies and yippies
31   hitchhike in
32   $50
33   boots.


34   out in front of the Mission I heard one guy say to
35   another:
36   "John Wayne won it."
37   "Won what?" said the other guy

[Page 22 ]


38   tossing the last of his rolled cigarette into the
39   street.


40   I thought that was
41   rather good.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /a day at the oak tree meet/ [from
        Mockingbird Wish Me Luck (1972) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   Filet's Rule, the 12 horse around 12 to one,
2   that was the first race, they had a different
3   janitor in the men's room, and I didn't have the
4   2nd race either, Bold Courage, around 19 to one,
5   my Kentucky Lark got a dead ride from the boy
6   who stood up in the saddle all the way, which is
7   hardly a way to ride a 2 to one shot, and I
8   got a roast beef sandwich for $1.10, if you're going
9   to go broke you might as well eat well, and in the
10   3rd Grandby had to pull up to avoid Factional who
11   came over on him, the stewards argued for 15
12   minutes before allowing it to stand, and there I was
13   52 dollars down and the mountains were dry,
14   life was hardly worthwhile, and in the 4th, Aberion
15   Bob I think was the play but I went to Misty Repose
16   who got locked in the one hole at 6 furlongs and had
17   nothing left when he swung out. A. Bob won handily and
18   I was 67 dollars down, the coffee was a quarter and
19   the coffee girl looked like an x-prostitute, which
20   she probably wasn't, and then in the 5th, Christie's
21   Star took it at thirteen to one and I was 3rd, I think
22   with Bold Street, I can't beat those maiden races, and
23   I was 77 dollars down and bought a hot dog which cost
24   50 cents and was gone in 2 bites, and then I had to
25   go 20 win on Nearbrook, which won by 6 or 7 lengths
26   but at 4 to 5, so I am still 65 dollars down and the
27   mountains are still dry, but nobody is talking to me
28   or bothering me, there's a chance. I put 15 win on
29   Moving Express and 5 win on Choctaw Charlie and C.C.
30   comes in at eight to one, and then I am only 37 dollars
31   down, and we have the 8th race, Manta at 3 to 5
32   was a rather obvious bet, I looked for something to beat
33   her and came up with Hollywood Gossip. Manta went
34   on by, but I had been afraid of that and had only gone
35   5 win, I was 42 dollars down with one race to go, and
36   I put 20 win on Vesperal and ten win on Cedar Cross,
37   and Cedar Cross ran dead and Vesperal went wire to
38   wire, so that was 72 down before the race, and
39   you take the 84 dollar pay off and you've got 12 dollars
40   profit. There you go: behind for 8 races, winner in
41   the 9th. Nothing big, but bankroll intact. This comes,

[Page 24 ]


42   my friends, out of years of training. There are thorough-
43   bred horses and thoroughbred bettors. What you do is
44   stay with your plays and let them come to you. Loving
45   a woman is the same way, or loving life. You've
46   got to work a bit for it. In a day or 2 I'll go again
47   and get off better. You'll see me that night having a
48   quiet drink at the track bar as the losers run for the
49   parking lot. Don't talk to me or bother me and I won't
50   bother you. All right?

        Bukowski, Charles :  /rain/ [from Mockingbird Wish Me Luck
        (1972) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   a symphony orchestra.
2   there is a thunderstorm,
3   they are playing a Wagner overture
4   and the people leave their seats under the trees
5   and run inside to the pavilion
6   the women giggling, the men pretending calm,
7   wet cigarettes being thrown away,
8   Wagner plays on, and then they are all under the
9   pavilion. the birds even come in from the trees
10   and enter the pavilion and then it is the Hungarian
11   Rhapsody #2 by Lizst, and it still rains, but look,
12   one man sits alone in the rain
13   listening. the audience notices him. they turn
14   and look. the orchestra goes about its
15   business. the man sits in the night in the rain,
16   listening. there is something wrong with him,
17   isn't there?
18   he came to hear the
19   music.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /the colored birds/ [from Mockingbird Wish
        Me Luck (1972) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   it is a highrise apt. next door
2   and he beats her at night and she screams and nobody stops it
3   and I see her the next day
4   standing in the driveway with curlers in her hair
5   and she has her huge buttocks jammed into black
6   slacks and she says, standing in the sun,
7   "god damn it, 24 hours a day in this place, I never go anywhere!"


8   then he comes out, proud, the little matador,
9   a pail of shit, his belly hanging over his bathing trunks---
10   he might have been a handsome man once, might have,
11   now they both stand there and he says,
12   "I think I'm goin' for a swim."
13   she doesn't answer and he goes to the pool and
14   jumps into the fishless, sandless water, the peroxide-codein water,
15   and I stand by the kitchen window drinking coffee
16   trying to unboil the fuzzy, stinking picture---
17   after all, you can't live elbow to elbow to people without wanting to
18   draw a number on them.
19   every time my toilet flushes they can hear it. every time they
20   go to bed I can hear them.


21   soon she goes inside and then comes out with 2 colored birds
22   in a cage. I don't know what they are. they don't talk. they
23   just move a little, seeming to twitch their tail-feathers and
24   shit. that's all they do.
25   she stands there looking at them.
26   he comes out: the little tuna, the little matador, out of the pool,
27   a dripping unbeautiful white, the cloth of his wet suit gripping.
28   "get those birds in the house!"
29   "but the birds need sun!"
30   "I said, get those birds in the house!"
31   "the birds are gonna die!"
32   "you listen to me, I said, GET THOSE BIRDS IN THE HOUSE!"
33   she bends and lifts them, her huge buttocks in the black slacks
34   looking so sad.
35   he slams the door behind them. then I hear it.
36   BAM!
37   she screams
38   BAM! BAM!
39   she screams

[Page 27 ]


40   then: BAM!
41   and she screams.


42   I pour another coffee and decide that that's a new
43   one: he usually only beats her at
44   night. it takes a man to beat his wife night and
45   day. although he doesn't look like much
46   he's one of the few real men around
47   here.

2   with my belly dangling over my

4   and I glare at the lampshade

8   the boys put their muskets down
9   lift high their fish-green beer


10   as I fall forward off the couch

1   at high noon
2   at a small college near the beach
3   sober
4   the sweat running down my arms
5   a spot of sweat on the table
6   I flatten it with my finger
7   blood money blood money
8   my god they must think I love this like the others
9   but it's for bread and beer and rent
10   blood money
11   I'm tense lousy feel bad
12   poor people I'm failing I'm failing


13   a woman gets up
14   walks out
15   slams the door


16   a dirty poem
17   somebody told me not to read dirty poems
18   here


19   it's too late.


20   my eyes can't see some lines
21   I read it
22   out---
23   desperate trembling
24   lousy


25   they can't hear my voice
26   and I say,
27   I quit, that's it, I'm
28   finished.


29   and later in my room
30   there's scotch and beer:
31   the blood of a coward.


32   this then
33   will be my destiny:
34   scrabbling for pennies in dark tiny halls

[Page 32 ]


35   reading poems I have long since become tired
36   of.


37   and I used to think
38   that men who drove busses
39   or cleaned out latrines
40   or murdered men in alleys were
41   fools.

1   there are 4 guys at the door
2   all 6 feet four
3   and checking in at
4   around 210 pounds,
5   slim killers.
6   come in, I say,
7   and they walk in with their drinks
8   and circle the old man---
9   so you're Bukowski, eh?
10   yeh, you fucking killers, what do you
11   want?
12   well, we don't have a car
13   and Lee needs a ride to this nightspot
14   in Hollywood.
15   let's go, I say.
16   we get into my car
17   all of us drunk, and
18   somebody in back says,
19   we've been reading your poetry a long time,
20   Bukowski, and I say,
21   I've been writing it a long time,
22   kid. we dump Lee at the nightspot
23   then stop off for enough beer and cigars
24   to demolish the
25   stratosphere.
26   back at my place I sit with the killers and
27   we drink and smoke.
28   it is somehow enjoyable.
29   I find I can outdrink and outsmoke them
30   but I realize that in areas such as fights on
31   the front lawn
32   my day is done.
33   the motherfuckers are just getting too young and
34   too big.
35   after they pass out
36   I give each of them a pillow and a blanket
37   and make sure all the cigars are
38   out.


39   in the morning they were just 3 big kids
40   untrapped, a couple of them

[Page 34 ]


41   heaving in the bathroom.
42   an hour later
43   they were gone.

45   I can't say that
46   I disliked them.

1   I can see myself now
2   after all these suicide days and nights,
3   being wheeled out of one of those sterile rest homes
4   (of course, this is only if I get famous and lucky)
5   by a subnormal and bored nurse ...
6   there I am sitting upright in my wheelchair ...
7   almost blind, eyes rolling backward into the dark part of my skull
8   looking
9   for the mercy of death ...


10   "Isn't it a lovely day, Mr. Bukowski?"


11   "O, yeah, yeah ..."


12   the children walk past and I don't even exist
13   and lovely women walk by
14   with big hot hips
15   and warm buttocks and tight hot everything
16   praying to be loved
17   and I don't even
18   exist ...


19   "It's the first sunlight we've had in 3 days,
20   Mr. Bukowski."


21   "Oh, yeah, yeah."


22   there I am sitting upright in my wheelchair,
23   myself whiter than this sheet of paper,
24   bloodless,
25   brain gone, gamble gone, me, Bukowski,
26   gone ...


27   "Isn't it a lovely day, Mr. Bukowski?"


28   "O, yeah, yeah ..." pissing in my pajamas, slop drooling out of
29   my mouth.


30   2 young schoolboys run by---

[Page 36 ]




31   "Hey, did you see that old guy?"


32   "Christ, yes, he made me sick!"


33   after all the threats to do so
34   somebody else has committed suicide for me
35   at last.


36   the nurse stops the wheelchair, breaks a rose from a nearby bush,
37   puts it in my hand.


38   I don't even know
39   what it is. it might as well be my pecker
40   for all the good
41   it does.

3   shoving his chalky foot
4   upon my desk,
5   and that was it,
6   bang bang,
7   he looked at me,
8   and it was my bone body
9   and I was what remained,
10   and there was a newspaper
11   on my desk
12   and somebody folded the newspaper
13   and I folded,
14   I was the newspaper
15   under somebody's arm
16   and the sheet of me
17   had eyes
18   and I saw the skeleton
19   watching
20   and just before the door closed
21   I saw a man who looked
22   partly like Napoleon,
23   partly like Hitler,
24   fighting with my skeleton,
25   then the door closed
26   and we went down the steps
27   and outside
28   and I was under
29   the arm
30   of a fat little man
31   who knew nothing
32   and I hated him
33   for his indifference
34   to fact, how I hated him
35   as he unfolded me
36   in the subway
37   and I fell against the back
38   of an old woman.

1   5 men in black passing my window
2   it's Sunday
3   they've been to church.


4   5 men in black passing my window;
5   they're between 40 and 60
6   each with a little smile on his face
7   like a tarantula.


8   they're without women;
9   I am too.


10   look at them,
11   it's the way they walk by fives---
12   no two together,
13   not speaking,
14   just the little smiles.


15   each has done his horrible thing
16   during the week---
17   fired a stockboy, stolen from a partner;
18   cowardly horrible little men
19   passing my window.


20   5 men in black with little
21   smiles.


22   I could machinegun them
23   without feeling
24   banal


25   bury them without a tear:
26   death of all these things
27   Springtime.

8   clubs.


9   hell, you can't blame him;
10   I've worked for $16 a week,
11   quit, and lived a month on
12   that.


13   his wife is suing for divorce
14   and wants $200 a week

16   he has to stay famous and

3   said
4   are you really Charles

6   and I said
7   forget that
8   I do not feel good
9   I've got the sad sads
10   all I want to do is
11   fuck you


12   and she laughed
13   she thought I was being
14   clever
15   and O I just looked up her long slim legs of heaven
16   I saw her liver and her quivering intestine
17   I saw Christ in there
18   jumping to a folk-rock


19   all the long lines of starvation within me
20   rose
21   and I walked over
22   and grabbed her on the couch
23   ripped her dress up around her face


24   and I didn't care
25   rape or the end of the earth
26   one more time
27   to be there
28   anywhere
29   real


30   yes
31   her panties were on the
32   floor
33   and my cock went in
34   my cock my god my cock went in

1   look, he said, that story,
2   everybody knew it was me.


3   by god, I said, are you still
4   hacking at that?
5   I thought you were going to write a
6   story exposing /me?/
7   what happened to that?


8   you didn't have to write that
9   story about me!


10   forget it, I said, it's not
11   important.


12   he leaped and slammed the door;
13   the glass didn't break
14   but the curtain rod and curtain
15   fell.


16   I tried to finish a one-act play
17   gave up
18   and went to bed.


19   the phone rang.


20   listen, he said, when I came over
21   I had no idea I'd act like
22   that.


23   it's o.k., I said.
24   relax.


25   I leaned back to sleep and I
26   thought,
27   now I'll probably write a poem about
28   him.


29   there seems to be no way out, I thought,
30   everybody is always angry about the truth
31   even though they claim to
32   believe in it.


33   I slept and wrote the poem
34   in the morning.

1   Bartenders are human too
2   and when he reached for the baseball bat
3   the little Italian hit him in the face
4   with a bottle
5   and several whores screamed.
6   I was just coming out
7   of the men's room
8   when I saw the bartender
9   get off the floor
10   and open the cigar box
11   to get the gun,
12   and I turned around
13   and went out back,
14   and the Italian
15   must have argued poorly
16   because I heard the shot
17   just as I got
18   the car door open.


19   I drove down the alley
20   and turned East on 7th st.,
21   and I hadn't gone a block
22   before a cop pulled me over.


23   You trying to get killed?
24   he asked. Turn your lights
25   on.


26   He was a big fat one and he
27   kept pushing his helmet
28   further and further
29   on the back of his head.


30   I took the ticket and then
31   drove down to Union. I
32   parked outside the Reno Hotel
33   and went downstairs
34   to Harry's.

35   It was quiet there, only
36   a big redhead, bigger
37   than the cop.

25   "I was here before. you were rather short. you didn't like my
26   poems."
27   "there are plenty of reasons for not liking
28   poems."
29   "try these."
30   he put them on me. they were flatter than the paper they were typed
31   upon. there wasn't a tick or a
32   flare. not a sound. I'd never read
33   less.


34   "uh," I said, "uh-uh."


35   "you mean you don't LIKE
36   them?"


37   "there's nothing there---it's like a pot of evaporated piss."

[Page 51 ]




38   he took the papers, stood up and walked
39   around. "look, Bukowski. I'll put some broads from Malibu on
40   you, broads like you've never
41   seen."


42   "oh yeah, baby?" I asked.


43   "yeah, yeah," he
44   said.


45   and ran out the
46   door.


47   his Malibu broads were like his
48   poems: they
49   never arrived.

1   the black poets
2   young
3   come to my door---
4   "you Bukowski?"
5   "yeh. come in."


6   they sit and look around at the

8   and at

10   they hand me their poems.
11   I read
12   them.


13   "no," I say and hand them
14   back.


15   "you don't like
16   them?"


17   "no."


18   "'roi Jones came down to see us at our

22   "... Leroi Jones, Ray Bradbury, lots of big
23   boy ... they said this stuff was

25   "it's bad poetry, man. they are powdering your
26   ass."

29   "ah, god, don't you /see/ ? they are tickling your

32   "you just don't understand

34   "I do, they are rhymers, full of

45   I suppose I haven't. and it's useless to tell you that I am not

1   the bus driver grins while sweating in the heat
2   of the plateglass windshield,
3   he doesn't have a chance---
4   only Hollywood Boulevard, an impossible sun
5   and an impossible timetable,
6   there are so many without a chance.
7   I realize that there is very little chance
8   for any of
9   us. poetry won't save us or a job won't save us,
10   a good job or a bad
11   job.
12   we take a little bit and hang onto that until it is
13   gone.
14   gongs ring, dances begin, there are holidays and
15   celebrations ...
16   we try to cheat the bad dream ...
17   poetry, you whore, who will go to any man and then
18   leave him ...
19   the bus driver has Hollywood Boulevard
20   I sit next to a fat lady who lays her dead thigh
21   against me.
22   there is a tiny roll of sweat behind one of the bus driver's
23   ears. he is ashamed to brush it
24   away.
25   the people look ahead or read or look out their
26   windows.
27   the tiny roll of sweat begins to roll
28   it rolls along behind the ear
29   then down the neck,
30   then it's
31   gone.
32   Vine street, says the bus driver,
33   this is Vine
34   street.
35   he's right, at last. what a marvelous thing.
36   I get off at Vine Street. I need a drink or something
37   to eat. I don't care about the bus
38   anymore. it is a
39   rejected poem. I don't need it
40   anymore.
41   there will be more busses.

42   I decide upon something to eat

1   he came up on the porch
2   with a grinning subnormal type
3   and they stood there
4   drunk on wine.
5   the painter had his coat wrapped around something,
6   then pulled the coat away---
7   it was a policeman's helmet
8   complete with badge.
9   "gimme 20 bucks for this," he said.
10   "fuck off, man," I said, "what do I want with a
11   cop's derby?"
12   "ten bucks," he said.
13   "did you kill him?"
14   "5 bucks ..."
15   "what happened to that 6 grand you made
16   at your art show last month?"
17   "I drank it. all in the same bar."
18   "and I never got a beer," I said.
19   "2 bucks ..."
20   "did you kill him?"
21   "we ganged him, punched him around a bit ..."
22   "that's chickenshit. I don't want the headpiece."
23   "we're 18 cents short of a bottle, man ..."


24   I gave the painter 35 cents
25   keeping the chain on the door, slipping it to him
26   with my fingers. he lived with his mother,
27   beat his girlfriend regularly
28   and really didn't paint that
29   well. but I suppose a lot of obnoxious characters
30   work their way into
31   immortality.


32   I'm working on it myself.

3   months,
4   and he handed me the
5   stack and I
6   thought
7   oo oo.
8   a young girl
9   walked up
10   and handed him a plate of
11   corn and meat
12   in his cottage
13   by the beach
14   and the sea rolled in
15   and I turned the
16   white
17   pages.
18   I've been drinking
19   he said
20   and writing
21   and the young girl said
22   is there anything else
23   I can get
24   you?
25   he was rich and I was poor
26   and the sea rolled in
27   and I turned the
28   white
29   pages.
30   what do you think?
31   he asked?
32   and I said,
33   well, some of
34   these ...
35   but I didn't
36   finish.
37   later I walked
38   outside. I walked down
39   the sand to where the sand got
40   wet and I looked at the water and
41   the moon

42   and then I turned around

7   well, muscles please the ladies
8   and keep the bullies
9   at bay---
10   so
11   what?
12   is it worth it?
13   is it worth the collected works
14   of Balzac?
15   or a 3 week vacation
16   in Spain?
17   or, is it another way of
18   suffering?
19   if you got paid to do it,
20   you'd hate it.
21   if a man got paid to make love,
22   he'd hate it.


23   still, one needs the
24   exercise---

26   only the brain and soul get
27   worked-out.
28   quit your bitching and
29   do it.

5   these blue evenings of walking past buildings

7   know nothing of

3   like monkeys---
4   a piece of chinaware broken,
5   the Union Rescue Mission falls down---


6   6 a.m.
7   they sit in their cars
8   they're all driving around---
9   where are they going?


10   a little excitement has broken into their
11   canned lives


12   stranger stands next to stranger
13   chattering gibberish fear
14   anxious fear
15   anxious laughter ...


16   my baby, my flowerpots, my ceiling
17   my bank account


18   this is just a tickler
19   a feather
20   and they can't bear it ...


21   suppose they bombed the city
22   as other cities have been bombed
23   not with an a-bomb
24   but with ordinary blockbusters
25   day after day,
26   every day
27   as has happened
28   in other cities of the world?


29   if the rest of the world could see you today
30   their laughter would bring the sun to its knees
31   and even the flowers would leap from the ground
32   like bulldogs

35   and who cares where it is
36   as long as it's somewhere away from

        Bukowski, Charles :  /the good life at o'hare airport/ [from
        Mockingbird Wish Me Luck (1972) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   3 hour wait at the airport in
2   Chicago, surrounded by killers
3   I found a table alone
4   and had a scotch and water
5   when 4 preachers sat down,
6   and look here, said one of them,
7   looking at a newspaper,
8   here's a guy drunk, ran through a
9   wall, killed one person, injured 4.
10   if I was him, said another,
11   I'd commit suicide.
12   I ordered a large beer
13   and sat there reading my own novel.
14   look here, said the one with the paper,
15   here's a guy, no, two guys,
16   tried to hijack a liquor truck,
17   they were so dumb they didn't even know
18   it was only carrying wine. didn't even
19   break the seal. bound the driver
20   and then stopped for coffee. the driver
21   leaned on the horn and a cop car came by
22   and that was it. they went in and got
23   those 2 guys.
24   any 2 guys that dumb, said another,
25   they sure have it coming.
26   look sweetie, said another to the waitress,
27   we don't want anything to drink, we don't drink,
28   but we could sure use 4
29   coffees, and haven't I seen you someplace before,
30   hee hee hee?
31   give me another beer, I told the
32   waitress. I drink, and I've never seen you anyplace
33   before.
34   the waitress came back with 4 cups of coffee
35   and the beer, and I sat there reading my own novel
36   as the 4 preachers sat there
37   whirling their spoons around their cups,
38   clink clink clink
39   and I thought, this isn't a bad novel
40   this isn't a bad novel
41   at all, but the next one is going to be

[Page 66 ]


42   better, and I lifted my old beer and finished it,
43   and then drank some of the new
44   one, and clink clink clink
45   went the spoons against the cups
46   and one of the preachers coughed
47   and everybody was unhappy but
48   me.

1   driving through the park
2   I notice men and women playing golf
3   driving in their powered carts
4   over billiard table lawns,
5   they are my age
6   but their bodies are fat
7   their hair grey
8   their faces waffle batter,
9   and I remember being startled by my own face
10   scarred, and mean as red ants
11   looking at me from a department store mirror
12   and the eyes mad mad mad
13   I drive on and start singing
14   making up the sound
15   a war chant
16   and there is the sun
17   and the sun says, good, I know you,
18   and the steering wheel is humorous
19   and the dashboard laughs,
20   see, the whole sky knows
21   I have not lied to anything
22   even death will have exits
23   like a dark theatre.
24   I stop at a stop sign and
25   as fire burns the trees and the people and the city
26   I know that there will be a place to go
27   and a way to go
28   and nothing need ever be
29   lost.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /the mockingbird/ [from Mockingbird Wish Me

1   the mockingbird had been following the cat
2   all summer
3   mocking mocking mocking
4   teasing and cocksure;
5   the cat crawled under rockers on porches
6   tail flashing
7   and said something angry to the mockingbird
8   which I didn't understand.


9   yesterday the cat walked calmly up the driveway
10   with the mockingbird alive in its mouth,
11   wings fanned, beautiful wings fanned and flopping,
12   feathers parted like a woman's legs,
13   and the bird was no longer mocking,
14   it was asking, it was praying
15   but the cat
16   striding down through centuries
17   would not listen.


18   I saw it crawl under a yellow car
19   with the bird
20   to bargain it to another place.


21   summer was over.

1   someday the lion will
2   walk in
3   he'll grab an arm
4   just above the elbow
5   my old arm
6   my wrinkled dice-shooting arm
7   and
8   I'll scream
9   in my bedroom
10   I won't understand at all
11   and he'll be
12   too strong for me,
13   and people will walk in---
14   a wife, a girlfriend, a bastard son,
15   a stranger from down the street
16   and a
17   doctor
18   and
19   they will
20   watch
21   and the lion won't bother them
22   yet,
23   and then my arm will be
24   gone
25   the doctor will put the
26   stethoscope to my chest
27   ask me to cough
28   then
29   he will turn to the others and
30   say
31   there's a chance
32   but I think he's going
33   under---shock and loss of
34   blood.


35   hell, I know that,
36   and now the lion has my
37   other arm
38   I try to knee him
39   his tail knocks a picture off the wall

[Page 74 ]


40   a picture of a Dutch windmill and a
41   pond


42   it is a fine day
43   the world looks good
44   I feel I'd like to be
45   swimming or fishing or sleeping
46   under a tree
47   but the lion will not
48   let go


49   then
50   my other arm is
51   gone


52   the people kneel to
53   pray
54   all but the
55   doctor


56   the lion is clawing at my
57   chest
58   trying to get at the
59   heart
60   I ask the doctor to light me a
61   cigarette and
62   he does


63   then the
64   priest walks
65   in


66   the lion does not bother the priest
67   yet


68   I'd heard about the
69   lion
70   about how sometimes he was fast or sometimes he was
71   slow


72   I knew he usually preferred older people
73   although sometimes he even ate

[Page 75 ]


74   babies or young men and
75   girls


76   god o mighty! save me! save me!
77   I scream


78   but the people do not
79   move
80   they let the lion
81   eat me
82   the priest mumbles incantations I do not
83   understand
84   the doctor turns his back and looks
85   out the window


86   it is the month of July
87   with the taste of butter in the air
88   and I am rapidly becoming a
89   keepsake thing
90   as before my eyes I see the
91   moth, butcherbird, dove, vulture and
92   angel
93   burning


94   the lion eats my heart
95   and the doctor puts the sheet over my
96   head
97   and it is early in the
98   morning
99   very early in the
100   morning
101   and decent people are still
102   in bed
103   most of them asleep with bad breath
104   and very few of them making
105   love
106   and most of them
107   not like me
108   yet

11   the lobster eating houses are empty;
12   it's a recession, they say,
13   the good days are
14   over.
15   you can't tell an unemployed man
16   from an artist any more,
17   they all look alike
18   and the women look the same,
19   only a little more desperate.


20   we stop at a hippie hole
21   in Topanga Canyon ...
22   and wait, wait, wait;
23   the whole area of the canyon and the beach
24   is listless
25   useless
26   VACANCY, it says, PEOPLE WANTED.


27   the wood has no fire
28   the sea is dirty
29   the hills are dry
30   the temples have no bells
31   love has no bed


32   sun-stroked women without men


33   one sailboat


34   life drowned.

1   here I'm supposed to be a great poet
2   and I'm sleepy in the afternoon
3   here I am aware of death like a giant bull
4   charging at me
5   and I'm sleepy in the afternoon
6   here I'm aware of wars and men fighting in the ring
7   and I'm aware of good food and wine and good women
8   and I'm sleepy in the afternoon
9   I'm aware of a woman's love
10   and I'm sleepy in the afternoon,
11   I lean into the sunlight behind a yellow curtain
12   I wonder where the summer flies have gone
13   I remember the most bloody death of Hemingway
14   and I'm sleepy in the afternoon.


15   some day I won't be sleepy in the afternoon
16   some day I'll write a poem that will bring volcanoes
17   to the hills out there
18   but right now I'm sleepy in the afternoon
19   and somebody asks me, "Bukowski, what time is it?"
20   and I say, "3:16 and a half."
21   I feel very guilty, I feel obnoxious, useless,
22   demented, I feel
23   sleepy in the afternoon,
24   they are bombing churches, o.k., that's o.k.,
25   the children ride ponies in the park, o.k., that's o.k.,
26   the libraries are filled with thousands of books of knowledge,
27   great music sits inside the nearby radio
28   and I am sleepy in the afternoon,
29   I have this tomb within myself that says,
30   ah, let the others do it, let them win,
31   let me sleep,
32   wisdom is in the dark
33   sweeping through the dark like brooms,
34   I'm going where the summer flies have gone,
35   try to catch me.

1   with one punch, at the age of 16 and 1/2,
2   I knocked out my father,
3   a cruel shiny bastard with bad breath,
4   and I didn't go home for some time, only now and then
5   to try to get a dollar from
6   dear momma.


7   it was 1937 in Los Angeles and it was a hell of a
8   Vienna.


9   I ran with these older guys
10   but for them it was the same:
11   mostly breathing gasps of hard air
12   and robbing gas stations that didn't have any
13   money, and a few lucky among us
14   worked part-time as Western Union messenger
15   boys.


16   we slept in rented rooms that weren't rented---
17   and we drank ale and wine
18   with the shades down
19   being quiet quiet
20   and then awakening the whole building
21   with a fistfight
22   breaking mirrors and chairs and lamps
23   and then running down the stairway
24   just before the police arrived
25   some of us soldiers of the future
26   running through the empty starving streets and alleys of
27   Los Angeles
28   and all of us
29   getting together later
30   in Pete's room
31   a small cube of space under a stairway, there we were,
32   packed in there
33   without women
34   without cigarettes
35   without anything to drink,
36   while the rich pawed away at their many
37   choices and the young girls let
38   them,

[Page 79 ]


39   the same girls who spit at our shadows as we
40   walked past.


41   it was a hell of a
42   Vienna.


43   3 of us under that stairway
44   were killed in World War II.


45   another one is now manager of a mattress
46   company.


47   me? I'm 30 years older,
48   the town is 4 or 5 times as big
49   but just as rotten
50   and the girls still spit on my
51   shadow, another war is building for another
52   reason, and I can hardly get a job now
53   for the same reason I couldn't then:
54   I don't know anything, I can't do
55   anything.


56   sex? well, just the old ones knock on my door after
57   midnight. I can't sleep and they see the lights and are
58   curious.


59   the old ones. their husbands no longer want them,
60   their children are gone, and if they show me enough good
61   leg (the legs go last)
62   I go to bed with
63   them.


64   so the old women bring me love and I smoke their cigarettes
65   as they
66   talk talk talk
67   and then we go to bed again and
68   /I/ bring /them/ love
69   and they feel good and
70   talk
71   until the sun comes
72   up, then we
73   sleep.


74   it's a hell of a
75   Paris.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /hot/ [from Mockingbird Wish Me Luck (1972)
        , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I was up under the attic and it was almost summer
2   and I sat around drinking wine
3   and watching the hot pigeons suffer and fuck
4   on the hot roof
5   and I listened to sounds on my radio and
6   drank the wine
7   and I sat there naked and sweating
8   and wishing I were back in the journalism class
9   where everybody was a
10   genius.


11   it was even hot when I got thrown out of there
12   for non-payment of rent and I signed on with a
13   track gang going West---the windows wouldn't open
14   and the seats and sides of the cars were 100 years old with
15   dust. they gave us cans of food but no openers
16   and we busted the cans against the side of the seats
17   ate raw hash, raw lima beans
18   the water tasted like candlewick
19   and I leaped out under a line of trees in the middle of
20   Texas, some small town, and the police found me asleep
21   on a park bench and put me in a cell with only a crapper,
22   no water, no sink, and they questioned me about robberies and
23   murders,
24   under a hot light
25   and getting nothing
26   they drove me to the next town 17 miles away
27   the big one kicked me in the ass
28   and after a good night's sleep
29   I went into the local library
30   where the young lady librarian seemed to take an interest in my
31   reading habits
32   and later we went to bed
33   and I woke up with teethmarks all over me and I said,
34   Christ, watch it, baby, you might give me
35   cancer!


36   you're an idiot, she said.


37   I suppose that I
38   was.

1   strange eyes in my head
2   I'm the coward and the fool and the clown
3   and I listen to a man telling me that I can get a
4   restaurant guide and an expanding cultural events calendar


5   I'm just not here today
6   I don't want restaurants and expanding cultural events
7   I want an old shack in the hills

1   oh my god, oh my dear god
2   that we should end up
3   on the end of a rope
4   in some slimy bathroom
5   far from Paris,
6   far from thighs that care,
7   our feet hanging down
8   above the simplicity
9   of stained tile,
10   telephone ringing,
11   letters unopened,
12   dogs pissing in the street ...


13   greater men than I
14   have failed to agree with Life.


15   I wish you could have met my brother, Marty:
16   vicious, intelligent, endearing,
17   doing
18   quite well.

1   Standing here,
2   doing what?
3   as exposed as an azalea
4   to a bee.


5   Where's the axman,
6   where's it done?


7   They tiptoe round
8   on rotting wood,
9   peeking into shelves.
10   Summertime!


11   Where's the sun,
12   where's the sea?


13   The god's are gone!
14   Everything hums
15   with humble severity ...
16   they wipe their faces
17   with cotton and rags
18   ---and /wait/ for morning.


19   Where's the fire,
20   where's the burn?


21   /Rain-spouts!/ and rats
22   printing dirge-notes in ashes ...
23   a voice plows my brain:
24   "the gods are dead."


25   Where's the time,
26   where's the place?


27   Somewhat eased, extinguished,
28   I listen behind me
29   to my bird eating seed,
30   hoping he'll chitter
31   and peep some pink
32   back into white elbows.

[Page 84 ]




33   I love that bird,
34   the simple needing of seed, so clear:


35   A god can be anything
36   that's needed right away.
37   The sound of aircraft overhead
38   winging a man ...
39   stronger now, not yet pure,
40   but moving away the dread.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /consummation of grief/ [from Mockingbird

1   I even hear the mountains
2   the way they laugh
3   up and down their blue sides
4   and down in the water
5   the fish cry
6   and all the water
7   is their tears.
8   I listen to the water
9   on nights I drink away
10   and the sadness becomes so great
11   I hear it in my clock
12   it becomes knobs upon my dresser
13   it becomes paper on the floor
14   it becomes a shoehorn
15   a laundry ticket
16   it becomes
17   cigarette smoke
18   climbing a chapel of dark vines ...


19   it matters little


20   very little love is not so bad
21   or very little life


22   what counts
23   is waiting on walls
24   I was born for this


25   I was born to hustle roses down the avenues of the dead.

1   the dead come running sideways
2   holding toothpaste ads,
3   the dead are drunk on New Year's eve
4   satisfied at Christmas
5   thankful on Thanksgiving
6   bored on the 4th of July
7   loafing on Labor Day
8   confused at Easter
9   cloudy at funerals
10   clowning at hospitals
11   nervous at birth;
12   the dead shop for stockings and shorts
13   and belts and rugs and vases and
14   coffeetables,
15   the dead dance with the dead
16   the dead sleep with the dead
17   the dead eat with the dead.


18   the dead get hungry looking at hogs' heads.


19   the dead get rich
20   the dead get deader


21   those sons of bitches


22   this graveyard above the ground


23   one tombstone for the mess,

1   by god, it was a long day
2   the 3 horse broke down
3   the cook burned his hand,
4   e. pitts was recalled from the sandlots
5   because the regular back had a
6   hamstring,
7   and the grunion ran again
8   through the oily sea
9   to plant eggs on shore and be caught
10   by unemployed drunks
11   with flopping canvas hats
12   and no woman at all.
13   offshore you could see the lights of a
14   passing yacht
15   with a party on board,
16   lots of girls and jokes and the
17   rest,
18   and they put the 3 horse in
19   the truck, carried him away from the
20   crowd and shot
21   him, little things like that and other
22   things
23   are what sometimes create unemployed drunks
24   with flopping canvas hats,
25   sans woman,
26   trying to grab for
27   grunion.

5   I'm on fire walking into a drugstore
6   I'm on fire I'm on fire
7   the girl hands me my change and
8   laughs at me


9   I'm on fire in my bed alone

12   about Trotsky, Hitler, Alexander the Great,
13   anybody at all, any walking living dead
14   human once upon the

16   I'm on fire looking at the grass

30   I'm on fire wrapping garbage into a newspaper
31   I'm on fire with heroes and dwarfs and poverty and hope
32   I'm on fire with love and anger

33   I'm on fire like a bat hanging upsidedown
34   like a bellboy hating the rich and smiling at their tips


35   I'm on fire in a supermarket

37   bend over to pick up some potato salad

46   the smoke and burning rises
47   and the ash is crushed under ...

49   the champion who quit on one knee
50   all burning
51   all alone
52   all one
53   ash


54   I'm on fire like a dirty bathtub in a lonely roominghouse
55   I'm on fire like the roach I kill with my shoe


56   I'm on fire with men and woman and animals
57   who are being tortured and mutilated in dark and
58   isolated places


59   I'm on fire with the armies and anti-armies
60   I'm on fire with the man I hate most in the world

64   the enduring seems forever

70   the sun is burning everything:


71   the dogs, the clouds, the icecream


72   the end


73   the end of the stairway
74   the end of the ocean
75   the last scream


76   the bug in the jar
77   spouts into flame
78   and the inside of the skull

1   since fact is an artifice of fiction
2   let's call this fiction so like all good boys and girls
3   we can relax


4   i was in frisco a dandy place with lakes or something
5   i could see the gold bridge and it wasn't teeth from my window
6   enough to drink almost always enough to drink


7   i wrote the old man down in l.a. you might as well get a story
8   ready for your god damned neighbors because i am not going to yr
9   war


10   if it were not for the war the last war /you would not be here/
11   i would not have met your mother and you would not have been born
12   SON, YOUR COUNTRY IS AT WAR ! ! ! !


13   the fact that i was born because of circumstances of war
14   did not seem to me a proper argument to create further circumstances


15   i went out and got drunk properly


16   then the next morning i went down to the draft board


17   a boy fainted when they took blood out of his arm and i looked at the
18   needle dip into my vein and watched the red of me run up into the tube
19   and felt rugged


20   they looked up my ass
21   and then i went in to see the sike


22   u have yr shorts on backwards he told me
23   i got up and switched them
24   he sat there looking at me
25   WHAT DO YOU THINK OF PICASSO?
26   at first i said all right now not much
27   do you write or paint?
28   yes
29   and?
30   and what? I ASKED IF YOU WROTE OR PAINTED. leave me alone
31   i told him

[Page 92 ]




32   WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN PUBLISHED? PAINTINGS HUNG?
33   nothing accepted
34   nothing accepted anywhere
35   do you believe in the war? he asked no i said
36   ARE YOU WILLING TO GO TO WAR? he asked no i said
37   WHY DON'T YOU BE A CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTOR? because i said
38   i am not sure there is a God
39   NEXT WEDNESDAY NIGHT WE ARE HAVING A MEETING, A PARTY
40   FOR DOCTORS, WRITERS AND ARTISTS I WANT YOU TO BE
41   THERE I AM INVITING YOU WILL YOU COME?


42   no


43   all right he said u don't have to go
44   u mean i asked the party or the war?


45   either one he said you didn't think we'd understand did you?


46   no


47   he wrote something on a slip of paper and folded it and stuck it to
my card
48   with a paperclip give them this, up the line


49   he had written a hell of a lot on the slip as i walked i managed
50   to lift the edge of the slip but all i cd see was
51   HIDES AN EXTREME,
52   SENSITIVITY UNDER A POKER FACE
53   which was news to me
54   and then some guy in a uniform screamed at me
55   ALL RIGHT SON UNCLE SAM DOESN'T WANT YOU
56   and i walked out into
57   the clear and beautiful air


58   are you going to war my landlady asked me no i said bad heart
59   that's too bad i'm sorry she said and i went upstairs and poured
60   a good one


61   bad heart bad heart bad heart have u done the wrong thing
62   maybe u ought to go maybe you ought to go and walk right into it

[Page 93 ]


63   hell, friend they turned you down uncle sam does not want you
64   you are insane
65   i smiled and poured another one


66   i don't know how much later but some time later i am sitting in
another
67   cheap room philly i am drinking a bottle of port have a record
68   player and i am listening to the 2nd movement of brahms' 2nd symphony
69   when there is a knock on the door
70   it is a very polite knock


71   and since i do not know anybody much i figure it is either
72   one of the whores down at the corner in love with me
73   or somebody come to give me the nobel prize


74   and i opened the door and 2 big men were there and one of them said
75   F.B.I. and the other one said yr under arrest


76   i went over and took the needle out of brahms' arm
77   we want to question u they said downtown
78   all right
79   u better put on a coat you might be gone some time


80   we walked down the stairs and out into the street and got into the car
81   and it seemed as if each window had a face hanging out of it
82   and there was another guy in the back and he said keep one hand
83   on each knee and don't move them
84   we drove along a while and then
85   i reached up to scratch my nose
86   WATCH THAT HAND! one of them screamed
87   this guy is pretty casual another one said
88   i think we got a good one yep i think we got a good one


89   oh lord oh christ i thought i wonder what i done
90   i wonder what i done


91   they took me into a room that was mostly empty except for pictures
92   photos on the walls


93   you see those one of them pointed voice most serious
94   yes i said
95   those are men who died in the service of the fbi

[Page 94 ]


96   they took me into another room where a man
97   sat behind his desk with his shirtsleeves rolled up

129   they took me down to a small cell with toilet and sink

[Page 95 ]


130   no bunk no chair i stood by the window and looked out the bars
131   it was Saturday morning and it was one of the main downtown
132   streets and it was sunny it looked good ouside people
133   walking along easily unnervous a record shop speakered its
134   music onto the street i did not feel good you only begin to
135   miss the simple life after it is taken away from u after u go
136   into a hospital and u are on a bed maybe to die or go back
137   or in a jail never knowing when or if you'll get out
138   that's when you think that's when the sunshine looks good
139   that's when just walking down to the corner to buy a paper
140   is something like beethoven's 9th


141   i was transferred to a prison a much larger prison the next day
142   they put me in a cell with a little fat man who looked like
143   a businessman


144   he put out his hand: I am Courtney Taylor
145   public enemy number one
146   i shook his hand
147   what are you in for? he asked
148   they say i'm a draft dodger
149   listen he said there's just one thing we don't like around here
150   one kind we have no use for and that's the draft dodger
151   honor among thieves
152   eh?
153   what do you mean?
154   I mean u fucker,
155   leave me alone
156   leave me alone


157   if u want to kill yourself i'll tell you how he said
158   i don't want to hear it i said
159   all you do is take that bucket over there fill it with water
160   take your shoe off put your foot in it but first bring down
161   the overhead light i'll hold you on my shoulders and you can work
162   the screws loose from the pipe then u bend it down take the
163   globe out stick your finger in the hole yr foot in the bucket
164   and yr out of here


165   it sounded good to me but there was something grotesque and
166   embarrassing about it somehow so i decided not to do it

[Page 96 ]


167   i stretched out on the bunk and pretty soon i felt things
168   biting me bedbugs
169   look i said do u gamble?
170   what do u mean?
171   i mean i said let's bet a nickel a bed bug i bet i can catch
172   more than u
173   they don't really come out till lights out he said
174   u mean it gets worse i asked
175   multiply by 30,
176   have u told the guard?
177   the screw? i'll tell him again
178   HEY SCREW SCREW ! ! ! WE GOT BUDBUGS IN HERE! GET
179   THESE GOD DAMNED BEDBUGS OUT OF HERE HEY SCREW!
180   nobody showed up
181   we began playing 21 blackjack and 5 minutes later the screw
182   walked in
183   let's not have so much screaming and you bastards probably
184   brought those things in here with you
185   i got hot in a crapgame in the exercise
186   yard and stayed hot 3, 4, 5 days and began to feel better i was
187   making more money than i ever made on the outside we were always
188   hungry there but after lights out the cook would come down with
189   jello and whipcream and coffee and bits of tenderloin and i'd slip
190   him a dollar or 2 and my public enemy friend stopped talking about
191   the evils of ceiling with a 4f and just when we were beginning to
192   enjoy our nickel a bedbug bets Taylor being a swindler of grand
193   order couldn't resist breaking some of his in half but i being
194   poetaster and counter of tombstones feeling the blade against my
195   whimpering brain i i was more agile ... and so psycho and public
196   enemy number one pinched out the souls of bedbugs while the world
197   grabbed its balls in more agony: ww 2
198   and we forgot in our small dying to acknowledge the small nobility
199   of whatever it was
200   BUTTT as i wuz saying
201   just as we were beginning to
202   enjoy our bedbugs they rushed us out of the cell
203   5 or 6 days after
204   the original complaint to fumigate
205   and they put me in with a polack
206   or something
207   old old old

[Page 97 ]


208   he tore up my bedsheet the first time
209   i went to exercise yard to make a clothesline out of it
210   and i have a very sensitive skin despite my poker face
211   and the wool blankets only those who can't stand rough wool will
212   know what i mean and so i told the old man
213   he was always on the crapper
214   puffiing on an empty pipe and all these makeshift makeshit
215   clotheslines hanging about dripping polack stockings and rags
216   (forget my name i am a Prussian nobleman) (this is fiction)
217   (isn't it) (i am getting a little bored with this and could use a
218   hot piece of ass as what man cd not?)
219   he wuz always on the crapper
220   puffing and saying
221   TARA BUBU EAT TARA BUBU SHEET
222   TARA BUBU EAT TARA BUBU SHEET
223   over and over
224   then he'd laugh
225   he was telling me the facts of life but all i could feel
226   as the bluebirds were driven away from the white cliffs of dover
227   was that wool blanket against me all and everywhere


228   LISTEN YOU OLD FUCK i told him I'VE KILLED TWO
229   MEN ALREADY AND I'D JUST AS SOON KILL U AS SCRATCH
230   MY ASS ! ! !


231   and the old idiot just laughed at me and for a moment i saw it
232   it was possible why not my hands about that wrinkled morgue of
233   flesh hoo says u can't kill what's already dead the eyes pop out
234   the tongue the lungs reach for air like kittens chasing a roll of
235   yarn but it was too ugly i don't think what got Dos in
236   /Crime and Punishment/ was that a single man could not judge what to
237   eradicate but that he COULD and KNEW IT and it was easier to turn
238   it over to God because you would finally have to eradicate
239   everything including self (though u usually began with self and
240   by eradicating self you eradicated the rest) and that would make God
241   a failure and that would not do because if you eliminate God
242   you have to come down to self and Self built in 20 or 30 or 60 years
243   cannot match a 2000 year backlog of root and tradition and so Dos
244   did the wise thing in admitting that he could be wrong although he
245   felt right and i let the old man shit and spew tara bubu and slept
246   in wool blankets


247   they broke up the crap game from the tower
248   the screw pointed his m.g. down

[Page 98 ]


249   the guy with the dice was taking too big a chunk from
250   each pot and the losers were getting hot I guess i should have
251   said it to the old man that way but one guy said to the furnisher
252   of dice DON'T PUT YOUR HAND IN THERE AGAIN UNTIL I TELL
253   U TO
254   and that was that until the screw got busy pointed his
255   steel nose


256   they came back for me and put me in some kind of room
257   they were making out a report
258   they asked me how to spell some words
259   like Andernach and so forth
260   i had a long red beard by then
261   and they asked me why
262   and i said
263   have you ever had the end cell where they
264   pass out one razorblade at the first cell and that same razor
blade is
265   used by the last man in the last cell, and have you ever celled
with an
266   old man whose only joy in life is eating and shitting and shaving and
267   wd u take 1/3 of his joy by taking the blade and shaving FIRST?
268   besides i use this red beard to fight the wool blankets with


269   i believe the kid is psycho one of them said


270   anyhow 3 or 4 days later
271   they let me out
272   only first i had to go through another physical for the army
273   but once again
274   i couldn't get past the sike
275   and that same day
276   when they let me out
277   even before i tried to get
278   a room i lay down in that park outside the philly library
279   i got on
280   my back and i felt little grass bugs crawling upon me and i let them
281   crawl they were beautifully clean
282   and i let the clouds come down
283   into my head but the sky was a bad color it hurt my eyes it was all
284   not good i began to fill up with sadness
285   and i heard some girls come by
286   talking and laughing and one of them tripped over my ankle

[Page 99 ]


287   and she said OOOh OOOH and then laughed
288   and i glared
289   up at them outa my red wool beard and one of them said
290   OOOOOH I WANT HIM ! ! !
291   and then i fell back and went back to the clouds
292   until later
293   clambering up out of the misery of the tomb
294   i sat upon a park bench watching traffic go by
295   and then it came a long caravan of trucks
296   filled with good young soldiers who only wanted to live
297   and i was young and watching and for a moment i loved them the crowd
298   but once again they turned on me and from the first truck
299   came a hissing and a cursing and then a booing a racket of vile hate
300   they wanted me with them and the whole avenue filled with hot sound
301   and more trucks came by slowly and it was an opera it was an
302   opera of condemnation, but i had not wanted war never will and
303   the gods the gods the dice had been good and i waved an arm
304   and smiled somebody screamed YOU BASTARD GET OFF YOUR
305   DEAD ASS !


306   but i did not i watched them go where they were going
307   i imagine the one who fainted he was in there too


308   we were all
309   very young i was young they were young
310   but i imagine
311   war being swine mob being swine
312   i was not as young as they

        Bukowski, Charles :  /ants/ [from Mockingbird Wish Me Luck
        (1972) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I used to be a great
2   traveler, even without
3   money. some cities I'd say in 2
4   weeks, some 3 days ... for years I went through the
5   cities, sometimes coming up against the same one
6   2 or 3 times.
7   now I'm here ... not only the same city ...
8   the same apartment ... for ten years ...
9   ten years ...
10   the last person in here before me was
11   crazy, they carried her off
12   screaming
13   in a big white
14   sheet, and I moved
15   in.
16   it's all right ... there have been various
17   jobs, various women, various
18   ways ...
19   one bungles through, it seems ...
20   but it's the ants here,
21   the ants here are crazy, they keep building nests
22   in the bathtub drain ... in the water basin
23   drain ...
24   it's delicious and sanitary and ugly:
25   I turn on the hot water tap
26   and watch them go spinning to a
27   burning drowning hell ...
28   it's neat ...
29   but they keep coming back ...
30   more and more ants ...
31   the ants come back faster than the women.
32   today I was about to do in a new
33   batch, both tub and water basin,
34   the phone rang,
35   it was my friend Danny. he said,
36   listen, you are the only real man I know. I'm
37   going to kill myself ...
38   go, I said, ahead ...
39   she left me, he said, she left me like that,
40   hardly any notice ... I really loved
41   her. (he began to cry.)

[Page 101 ]


42   listen, I said, meeting a bitch is an accident,
43   having one leave you is a basic reality,
44   be glad you're coming up against
45   basic reality ...
46   thanks, he said (sobbing), and hung
47   up.
48   I went back to the ants and turned on both water
49   taps at
50   once.


51   I burned and drowned them good.


52   Then the phone rang,
53   listen, he said, I'm going to do it,
54   I'm really going to do it.


55   I hung up.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /he wrote in lonely blood/ [from
        Mockingbird Wish Me Luck (1972) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   sitting here
2   typing
3   at a friend's house
4   I find a black book by the typer:
5   Jeffers': /Be Angry at the Sun./
6   I think of Jeffers often,
7   of his rocks and his hawks and his
8   isolation.
9   Jeffers was a real loner.
10   yes, he had to write.
11   I try to think of loners who don't break out
12   at all
13   in any fashion,
14   and I think, no, that's not strong,
15   somehow, that's dead.
16   Jeffers was alive and a loner and
17   he made his statements.
18   his rocks and his hawks and his isolation
19   counted.
20   he wrote in lonely blood
21   a man trapped in a corner
22   but what a corner
23   fighting down to the last mark


24   "I've built my rock," he sent the message to
25   the lovely girl who came to his door,
26   "you go build yours."
27   this was the same girl who had screwed Ezra,
28   and she wrote me that Jeffers sent her away
29   like that.
30   BE ANGRY AT THE SUN.
31   Jeffers was a rock who was not dead.
32   his book sits to my left now as I type.
33   I think of all his people crashing down
34   hanging themselves, shooting themselves,
35   taking poisons ...
36   locked away against an unbearable humanity.
37   Jeffers was like his people:
38   he demanded perfection and beauty
39   and it was not there
40   in human form. he found it in non-human

[Page 103 ]


41   forms. I've run out of non-human forms,
42   I'm angry at Jeffers. no,
43   I'm not. and if the girl comes to my door
44   I'll send her away too. after all,
45   who wants to follow old
46   Ez?

1   the other night
2   under a new moon
3   with the cuckoo clocks wound
4   tight
5   they stopped 6 Chinese fishermen
6   on skidrow
7   San Pedro
8   with 28 million dollars worth of
9   shit
10   in their boots.


11   they say it was an old dwarf
12   on a houseboat
13   who painted butterflies
14   on the sleeping body of his wife
15   in their pitiful
16   dream.


17   Artists, they say, sell out cheapest and most
18   quickly.


19   meanwhile, a fat man in Hong Kong
20   hearing,
21   decided to do away with Art,
22   and
23   while irritated
24   just to make Mr. Justice
25   soil his new clean sheets
26   he dialed a number
27   and arranged
28   the assassination of the
29   next-to-last
30   American
31   hero.

1   and the pleasures of the past,
2   remembering the Goose Girl at Hollywood Park
3   1950,
4   red coats and trumpets
5   and faces cut with knives and mistakes;
6   I am ready for the final
7   retreat;
8   I have an old-time kerosene burner,
9   candles, 22 cans of Campbell's soup
10   and an 80 year old uncle in Andernach,
11   Germany
12   who was once the burgermeister of that
13   town I was born in
14   so long ago.
15   I ache all over with the melody of pain
16   and people knock at my door
17   come in and drink with me
18   and talk,
19   but they don't realize I've quit,
20   have cleaned up the kitchen
21   chased the mice out from under the bed
22   and am making ready
23   for the tallest flame of them all.


24   I look at buildings and clouds and ladies,
25   I read newspapers as my shoelaces break,
26   I dream of matadors brave and bulls brave
27   and people brave and cats brave and
28   can openers brave.


29   my uncle writes me in trembling hand:
30   "How is your little girl,
31   and is your health good? You didn't answer
32   my last letter ..."


33   "Dear Uncle Heinrich," I answer,
34   "my little girl is very clever and pretty and
35   also good. I hope that you are

[Page 106 ]


36   happy and well. I enclose a photo
37   of Marina. Answer when you are
38   able. Things here are the same as they

40   been.

1   once in lockup, being fingerprinted and photographed, all
2   that,
3   I dropped ashes from my cigarette on the floor
4   and the cop got mad, he said,
5   "by god, where the hell do you think you are?"
6   "County jail," I said, and he said, "All right, wise guy, now you
7   walk down
8   that corridor and then
9   take a left."
10   I walked on down
11   took my left and
12   here it came---
13   they had this beast of a thing
14   in a huge cellblock, alone, alone,
15   and there were wires across the bars
16   it was the L.A. County drunktank
17   and it was their pet
18   the thing saw me
19   came running
20   and threw itself snarling against the bars and wire
21   wanting to kill me, and I stood there and watched it,
22   then spoke:
23   "Cigarette? how about a smoke?"
24   the thing rattled the wire and snarled a few more times
25   and I pulled out a smoke.
26   the thing grinned at me and I poked a cigarette through the wire
27   put it in his lips and lit him
28   up.
29   "I dislike them too," I said.
30   the thing grinned and bobbed its head
31   yes.


32   the cop came and took me away
33   and put me in a cell with
34   5 less living.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /4th of july/ [from Mockingbird Wish Me

1   it's amazing
2   the number of people who can't feel
3   pain.


4   put 40 in a room
5   squeezed against each other
6   hours of lethargic talk
7   and they don't
8   faint
9   scream
10   go mad or even
11   wince.


12   it appears as if they are waiting for
13   something that will never
14   arrive.


15   they are as comfortable as chickens or
16   pigs in their pens.


17   one might even consider it wisdom
18   if you can overlook the faces
19   and the conversation.


20   when the 4th is over
21   and they go back to their separate holes
22   then the sun will kiss me hello
23   then the sidewalks will look good again.


24   back in their cages
25   they'll dream of the next great
26   holiday.
27   probably Labor Day
28   smashing together on the freeways
29   talking together
30   40 in a room,
31   cousins, aunts, sisters, mothers, brothers, uncles,
32   sons, grandfathers, grandmothers, wives, husbands,
33   lovers, friends, all the rest,
34   40 in a room
35   talking about nothing,
36   talking about themselves.

1   he got drunk and went to sleep
2   in his bed
3   and the fire started
4   and he layed in there
5   burning
6   until a friend in the next room
7   smelled it
8   and ran in
9   and tried to pull him out of the fire
10   by his arms
11   and the skin rolled right off the arms
12   and he had to grab again
13   deeper
14   near the bone,
15   and he got him out and up
16   and the guy started screaming
17   and running blind,
18   he hit some walls
19   finally made 2 doorways
20   and with half a dozen men trying
21   to hold him
22   he broke free
23   and ran into the yeard
24   screaming
25   still running
26   he ran right into some barbed wire
27   and tangled in the barbed wire
28   screaming
29   and they had to go up
30   and get him loose
31   from the wire


32   he lived for 3 nights and 3
33   days


34   drinking and smoking
35   are bad for the
36   health.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /99 degrees/ [from Mockingbird Wish Me Luck
        (1972) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   September after Labor Day,
2   99 degrees in Burbank, Calif.
3   I am looking at a fly
4   a small brown fly on a yellow curtain;
5   the Mexicans would be wise enough to sleep under trees
6   on a day like this
7   but Americans are stricken with ambition
8   they will survive as powerful and unhappy
9   neurotics,
10   right now my tax money is dropping bombs
11   on starving people in Asia
12   as I fight the small fly that has arrived from the
13   curtain by my elbow;
14   I swing and miss the fly,
15   neurotic American me,
16   the boys who pilot those planes are nice boys, gentle,
17   they kill apathetically
18   with honor and grace,
19   without hate.
20   I know one, he is now a prof who teaches American
21   Literature at a university in Oregon,
22   I've been drunk with him and his wife, several times,
23   so he teaches me,
24   that's nice.
25   99 degrees in Burbank
26   and as I sit here
27   any number of things are happening,
28   mostly unhappy things
29   like swearing mechanics with hangovers climbing under cars
30   and drunken dentists pulling teeth and cursing
31   and bald-headed surgeons making too much of a mess,
32   and the editor of /Time/ magazine backing his car out of the
33   driveway
34   after an argument with his wife;
35   it's 99 degrees in Burbank
36   and there's a jet overhead,
37   I don't think it will bomb me,
38   those Asians don't have enough tax money,
39   the only clever Asians are the ones who claim they are
40   Supremely Blessed, speak good English,
41   grow grey thick beards plus a heavenly smile topped by

[Page 112 ]


42   shining eyes and
43   charge $4 admit at the Shrine to
44   teach placidity and non-ambition
45   and screw half the intellectual girls in the city.
46   it's 99 degrees in Burbank
47   and those who will survive will survive
48   and those who will die will die,
49   and most will dry up and look like toads eating hamburger
50   sandwiches at noon,
51   I don't know what to do---
52   send money and the way,
53   be kind to me,
54   I like it
55   effortless, sweet and easy, remember,
56   I never bombed
57   anybody, I
58   can't even kill this
59   fly.

1   I have them timed---
2   first the nurse will arrive in her nice
3   yellow automobile---4:10 p.m.---
4   she always shows me a lot of
5   leg---and I always look---
6   then think---
7   keep your leg, baby.
8   then, after that,
9   there's the man who arrives
10   and takes his bulldog
11   out to crap
12   about the time I'm out to mail
13   my letters. We test each other,
14   never speak---I live without working,
15   he works without
16   living;
17   I can see us some day
18   battling on his front lawn---
19   he screaming, "you bum!"
20   and myself screaming back:
21   "lackey! slave!"
22   as his bulldog chews my leg
23   and the neighbors pelt me
24   with stones.


25   I guess I better get interested in
26   Mexican jumping beans
27   and the Rose Bowl
28   Parade.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /the shoelace/ [from Mockingbird Wish Me
        Luck (1972) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   a woman, a
2   tire that's flat, a
3   disease, a
4   desire; fears in front of you,
5   fears that hold so still
6   you can study them
7   like pieces on a
8   chessboard ...
9   it's not the large things that
10   send a man to the
11   madhouse. death he's ready for, or
12   murder, incest, robbery, fire, flood ...
13   no, it's the continuing series of /small/ tragedies
14   that send a man to the
15   madhouse ...
16   not the death of his love
17   but a shoelace that snaps
18   with no time left ...
19   the dread of life
20   is that swarm of trivialities
21   that can kill quicker than cancer
22   and which are always there---
23   license plates or taxes
24   or expired driver's license,
25   or hiring or firing,
26   doing it or having it done to you, or
27   constipation
28   speeding tickets
29   rickets or crickets or mice or termites or
30   roaches or flies or a
31   broken hook on a
32   screen, or out of gas
33   or too much gas,
34   the sink's stopped-up, the landlord's drunk,
35   the president doesn't care and the governor's
36   crazy.
37   lightswitch broken, mattress like a
38   porcupine;
39   $105 for a tune-up, carburetor and fuel pump at
40   Sears Roebuck;

[Page 115 ]


41   and the phone bill's up and the market's
42   down
43   and the toilet chain is
44   broken,
45   and the light has burned out---
46   the hall light, the front light, the back light,
47   the inner light; it's
48   darker than hell
49   and twice as
50   expensive.
51   then there's always crabs and ingrown toenails
52   and people who insist they're
53   your friends;
54   there's always that and worse;
55   leaky faucet, Christ and Christmas;
56   blue salami, 9 day rains,
57   50 cent avocados
58   and purple
59   liverwurst.


60   or making it
61   as a waitress at Norm's on the split shift,
62   or as an emptier of
63   bedpans,
64   or as a carwash or a busboy
65   or a stealer of old lady's purses
66   leaving them screaming on the sidewalks
67   with broken arms at the age of
68   80.


69   suddenly
70   2 red lights in your rear view mirror
71   and blood in your
72   underwear;
73   toothache, and $979 for a bridge
74   $300 for a gold
75   tooth,
76   and China and Russia and America, and
77   long hair and short hair and no
78   hair, and beards and no

[Page 116 ]


79   faces, and plenty of /zigzag/ but no
80   pot, except maybe one to piss in and
81   the other one around your
82   gut.


83   with each broken shoelace
84   out of one hundred broken shoelaces,
85   one man, one woman, one
86   thing
87   enters a
88   madhouse.


89   so be careful
90   when you
91   bend over.

1   of course, he still gets his choice
2   after the bullfights,
3   but like with any other man
4   the special one comes along.
5   you can feel it in the stomach

7   and the girl said,
8   "It's either bullfighting or me."


9   he turned on love
10   to look at the face of death.


11   you can see him at Tijuana
12   working close to the horn
13   taking chance after
14   chance. he's been gored

16   and you wonder if the thing is

        Bukowski, Charles :  /i saw an old-fashioned whore today/ [from
        Mockingbird Wish Me Luck (1972) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   at the Thrifty drugstore
2   buying a 5th of gin and a 5th of vodka
3   she was a dyed blond
4   and she was relaxed in a black and white striped dress
5   that fell just below knee-length
6   and her breasts were large
7   and she was a little bit fat
8   and the salesgirl who served her showed disgust
9   but the whore was used to all that
10   and waited for her change
11   and for the bottles to be bagged
12   and when the whore walked out
13   she walked out easily
14   and people looked up from their magazines
15   and the boys around the newsstand looked
16   and the people parking their cars looked
17   and I walked behind her
18   and I looked
19   and she got into a green car
20   pooltable green
21   lit a cigarette,
22   and I'm sure she drove off to someplace
23   magic
24   where people were always laughing and
25   the music was always playing
26   and the drinks were good
27   and the furniture and rugs were nice
28   and the mountains were tall
29   and there were 3 German shepherds on the lawn,
30   and when she made love you knew it
31   and the price was not a lifetime,
32   the blue cigarette smoke curling in the black
33   ashtray a little wet with beer and mix,
34   she'd roll you with the security of a leopard
35   getting a deer,
36   and you ought to see her in the bathtub
37   singing an aria from one of those
38   Italian operas.

6   old men in the pawnshops of the world
7   looked around and killed themselves in my mind

9   didn't care

11   the day I saw you with your new

13   you and your new lover
14   walking down my boulevards
15   past the butcher shop
16   past the liquor store
17   past the real estate

19   ha ha


20   suddenly I didn't care
21   anymore


22   I went into the store and I bought
23   a figurine of a fawn
24   a small cactus
25   a box of shrimp
26   a pair of green gloves
27   a paring knife
28   some incense

1   I took my girlfriend to your last poetry reading,

3   yes, yes? I asked.
4   she's young and pretty, she said.
5   and? I asked.
6   she hated your
7   guts.


8   then she stretched out on the couch
9   and pulled off her
10   boots.


11   I don't have very good legs,

8   we walked back to my place

10   out of the apartment

12   one was a dwarf,
13   quite squat

16   "Hank, what's wrong with that

1   There I am
2   hungover, I've just made it in
3   and sit next to the mother of my child;
4   she sits there old and grey,
5   I sit there old and greying ...
6   there's a 6 year old daughter,
7   it's Christmas at Edison Grammar School,
8   December 17th,
9   1 p.m.
10   I sit mostly with women.
11   ah, there's a guy, and there's a guy ...
12   what's the matter with those bums?
13   no jobs? too
14   bad.


15   first there's something ...
16   they need 5 nominations for the
17   P.T.A. board.
18   4 old dames nominate each other,
19   like sneaky Hitlers.
20   nobody wants the 5th nomination ...
21   "Will everybody in favor of the nominations
22   being closed, please Yea in the
23   affirmative?"
24   there's a dog in there ... somebody
25   steps on his
26   tail:
27   "YEA-IKE!" he goes ...
28   everybody laughs, the nominations are closed.
29   Jesus Christ,
30   by a dog ...


31   o.k., trot them on.
32   no wait. the orchestra. tiny little people with
33   tiny little violins, most serious little
34   people. they are the string section.
35   they play "Christmas Songs" under the direction
36   of Mr. Plepler and Mr. Mettler.
37   Mettler? oh well, it's not
38   very good.

[Page 128 ]




39   "Five Little Christmas Bells," courtesy A.M. & P.M. Kindergarten,
40   has been changed to "Rocking The Child."
41   no reason is
42   given.


43   the dog has been
44   kicked out. I am still there
45   with hangover.


46   next the Kindergartens sing
47   "Jingle Bells." they've been taught by
48   Mrs. Bowers, Miss Lemon, Miss Lieberman.


49   I check my program ...
50   how much longer?


51   I notice that the children are black, white,
52   oriental, brown ... it's integration
53   but it's easy, they show us how easy.
54   2nd, 3rd, 4th grades ...
55   "Twelve Days of Christmas," they hold up paintings,
56   take them down; up down, up down, and back to
57   the Partridge in the Pear Tree.
58   they've done it. perfect. even with the
59   mistakes. courtesy Mrs. La Brache, Mrs. Bitticks.
60   next comes
61   "Pine Cones and Holly Berries," not so
62   good.


63   now here are the 5th and 6th graders ...
64   "Santa and the Mouse" ...
65   it's garbled, nobody can hear what they are
66   saying. it's under the direction of
67   Mr. Doerflinger. and he flings 'em.
68   he sits them down and sits right down with them
69   and all you can hear is
70   Mr. Doerflinger's beautiful voice.
71   Doerflinger seems everywhere. there he is in the center.
72   there he is showing his
73   buttocks. he likes to leap and run
74   about. he sings and sings and gives his 5th and 6th

[Page 129 ]


75   graders the minor parts to back his
76   singular chorus. I try to force myself to get jealous
77   of Doerflinger but I
78   can't. I'm very happy that I am not
79   Mr. Doerflinger. a woman across the aisle turns to me:
80   "He has a beautiful voice," she says.
81   "Yes," I smile back,
82   "he has."


83   "Christmas Tree," 3rd, 4th, 5th graders.
84   then, of course, we have
85   "Deck the Halls."
86   courtesy of Mrs. Homes.


87   o, my god, it's the 1st and 2nd graders
88   now! I'm nervous as shit.
89   I'm sick, I
90   don't know what to
91   do. I've done time, lain in alleys drunk,
92   slept with 50 women, I can't take
93   it ... the mother of my child seems
94   quite calm. I'm the
95   coward ... where /is/ she?
96   all of a sudden they bring them through the
97   back door---
98   they've been bringing them
99   through the front.
100   what's going on?


101   there's my kid, she's walking
102   past. "hi!" I say, "hi!"
103   she smiles and puts a finger to her
104   lips. "shhh ..."


105   they file onto the
106   platform. 1st and 2nd graders,
107   c/o Mr. Garnes, Miss McCormick, Mrs. Nagata, Mrs.
108   Samarge. o.k.
109   "Too Fat for the Chimney" ...
110   not too good,
111   but she keeps looking at me and grinning,

[Page 130 ]


112   singing, waving;
113   I smile back, wave, all
114   grins ... the old jailbird ...
115   then "Toy Trains."
116   much better. we applaud. they file out in order,
117   each waiting their
118   turn.


119   she's gone ...
120   somewhere.


121   the remainder of the program loses
122   some meaning,
123   except a very sexy young
124   chicano teacher
125   in a yellow dress
126   comes out and sings
127   "Silent Night"
128   in Spanish.


129   meanwhile Mr. Doerflinger is seen running about,
130   in this door, out that
131   one, showing his buttocks,
132   racing across the stage in some
133   great
134   urgency ...


135   "Doerflinger," says somebody.
136   he will not be forgotten by
137   anybody. he will not allow himself to be,
138   especially by the ladies.


139   it goes on.
140   " /Let There Be Peace On Earth/ "
141   we all sing together. the last number on the
142   program.


143   taxpayers forget Christmas, remember instead how nice your
144   children are.


145   we get back to the mother's apartment

[Page 131 ]


146   and there is a notice that they will shut off
147   the gas that
148   day. the mother claims no previous
149   notice has been
150   received.
151   I drive them down to 5th street
152   in Santa Monica
153   to the gas co.


154   I wave
155   goodbye. they stand on the corner.
156   my daughter has a hole
157   in her black
158   tights,
159   right
160   knee ...


161   "Let there be peace on earth
162   And let it begin with me.
163   Let there be peace on earth,
164   The peace that was meant to be.
165   With God as our Father,
166   Brothers all are we---
167   Let me walk with my brother
168   In perfect harmony."

1   I have lost it in Paradise Valley
2   with 4 women sitting in a kitchen
3   talking and laughing about men and love and life and
4   sex,
5   I have lost it in Paradise Valley
6   I have lost the word and the way and the light,
7   4 women sitting in the kitchen
8   drinking gallons of
9   coffee, and now
10   I sit in front of a window
11   looking at the desert,
12   one with Dante,
13   I wonder what the Paradise Valley ladies want.
14   these 3 sisters and a friend.


15   through this small window,
16   I see children dogs cattle horses flies sand
17   chickens ducks,
18   I hear the names of men now from the kitchen
19   and the girls laugh, and
20   I wonder, what am I
21   doing here?
22   these girls ... this continual examination of the senses
23   and the ideas and the reasons and the facts and the
24   moods
25   destroys, destroys ...


26   I have lost it in Paradise Valley.
27   you have to lose it somewhere:
28   I chose Arizona; although the love
29   last night was
30   good, I am lost in the desert
31   I have given it up.

2   she started smashing
3   all my bottles
4   my whiskey bottle and my
5   beer bottles,
6   meanwhile
7   yelling and screaming,
8   then she ran
9   out the door.


10   3 police arrived 5 minutes
11   later,
12   one holding shotgun,
13   and they asked
14   various questions,
15   one of them being:
16   what do you
17   do?


18   I'm a writer,
19   I said.


20   the cop smirked at
21   me, walked over to the
22   typewriter,
23   picked up some papers
24   and started
25   reading.

1   she undressed in front of me
2   keeping her pussy to the front
3   while I layed in bed with a bottle of
4   beer.


5   where'd you get that wart on
6   your ass? I asked.


7   that's no wart, she said,
8   that's a mole, a kind of
9   birthmark.


10   that thing scares me, I said,
11   let's call
12   it off.


13   I got out of bed and
14   walked into the other room and
15   sat on the rocker
16   and rocked.


17   she walked out. now, listen, you
18   old fart. you've got warts and scars and
19   all kinds of things all over
20   you. I do believe you're the ugliest
21   old man
22   I've ever seen.


23   forget that, I said, tell me some more
24   about that
25   mole on your butt.


26   she walked into the other room
27   and got dressed and then ran past me
28   slammed the door
29   and was
30   gone.


31   and to think,
32   she'd read all my books of
33   poetry too.


34   I just hoped she wouldn't tell
35   anybody that
36   I wasn't pretty.

12   "It's the BOMB! THE

16   I grabbed a fat blonde
17   tore her dress away,
18   /gotterdammerung!/
19   "I don't want to
20   die!" said the
21   blonde. the whole opera house was

        Bukowski, Charles :  /tight pink dress/ [from Mockingbird Wish
        Me Luck (1972) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   I read where this 44 year old soprano of some fame
2   fell out of a 4 story window
3   and killed herself, well, I suppose this is all right
4   for sopranos of some fame, but
5   I think that 8 stories is more
6   reasonable.
7   I know this woman, a sister of the mother of my
8   child, some years back
9   her husband divorced her
10   and she jumped out of a 4 story window
11   and broke both legs
12   and other assorted parts.
13   maybe that soprano just wasn't as tough as she was;
14   well, Helen got over the broken leg and parts,
15   and she came around one day to my place in a nice tight
16   pink dress, and we were alone but
17   nothing happened, I didn't want it to,
18   and we talked
19   and now she is really married to something,
20   one of the most obnoxious souls
21   that I know ...
22   "he plays the flute," says the mother of my child,
23   "they get along ..."
24   he came to see me one time and I ran him out the door:
25   he packed death around with him like breath chasers.
26   I've advised her to go 12 stories high
27   when this one fails ...
28   I should have taken her the day she arrived in her
29   tight pink dress ...
30   this guy and his flute ...
31   he probably shits flutes ...
32   and Helen with all that money, you think she might have
33   done better.

6   caught in a juniper brush, through love spilled
7   behind a broken shade on an October day;
8   through forms and windows and lines,
9   through a book by Kafka stained with wine,
10   through wives and friends and jails,
11   standing young once
12   hearing Beethoven or Bruckner,

19   falling on the ice, drunk and numbed,
20   you picking up she, she picking up he,
21   until at last, laughing across all barriers,
22   no marriage was ever more innocent or blessed,
23   and I remember her name and yes her eyes,

10   my novelist friend may be crazy /now/
11   or she wouldn't be in the same house

13   or maybe I'm the one who's crazy:
14   she's told me a couple of times she's going to

17   well, taking a chance with my balls on the line

2   and sometimes when we are making love
3   she'll snarl and spit
4   and her hair comes down
5   and she looks out from the strands
6   and shows me her fangs
7   but I kiss her anyhow and continue to love.
8   have you ever kissed a panther?
9   have you ever seen a female panther enjoying
10   the act of love?
11   you haven't loved, friend.
12   you with your squirrels and chipmunks
13   and elephants and sheep.
14   you ought to sleep with a panther
15   you'll never again want
16   squirrels, chipmunks, elephants, sheep, fox,
17   wolverines,
18   never anything but the female panther
19   the female panther walking across the room
20   the female panther walking across your soul,
21   all other love songs are lies
22   when that black smooth fur moves against you
23   and the sky falls down against your back,
24   the female panther is the dream arrived real
25   and there's no going back
26   or wanting to---
27   the fur up against you,
28   the search over
29   and you are locked against the eyes of a panther.

15   now dreaming of china dogs

1   death, he said, let it come,
2   it was after the races,
3   zipper on pants broken,
4   $80 winner
5   out one woman
6   he drove through stop signs and
7   red lights
8   at 70 m.p.h. on a side street
9   and then he heard the noise---
10   he was smashing through a barricade of
11   street obstructions
12   boards and lights flying
13   things jumping on the hood,
14   the car was thrown against the curbing
15   and he straightened it just in time
16   to miss a parked car,
17   he was drunk but it was the first time in
18   35 years he had hit anything,
19   and he ran up a dead end street,
20   turned, came on out,
21   took two rights
22   and 5 minutes later he was inside his
23   apartment. He got on the phone
24   and an hour later there were 14 people
25   drinking with him,
26   all but the right one,
27   and the next day he was sick
28   and she was there
29   and she said she had lost her purse out of
30   town ($55 and all her i.d.), 100 miles out of town,
31   she had gotten tired of waiting for him to phone
32   or not to phone;
33   she said, let's not have any more splits, I can't
34   bear them,
35   and he vomited, and she said,
36   all you want to do is kill yourself.
37   he said, all right, no more splits,
38   but he knew it would happen again and again
39   right down to the last split,
40   and he got up and cleaned his mouth and washed
41   and got back into bed with her

[Page 152 ]


42   and she held him like a baby,
43   and he thought, hell, what kind of man am I?
44   and then he didn't care
45   and they kissed
46   and it was all right until
47   next time.

1   was all set to write an immortal poem,
2   it was 9:30 p.m.,
3   had taken me all day to get the juices
4   properly aligned,
5   I sat down to the typewriter
6   reached for the keys and then
7   all the lights in the neighborhood went out.
8   she was working on her novel.
9   well, she said, we might as well go to
10   bed.
11   we went to bed.
12   since we had fucked 5 times in 2 nights
13   we decided it might be a better time to
14   tell eerie stories.
15   she told me one about the 2 sisters lost in the woods
16   who came upon the madman's house, but it was
17   cold and dark and he was nowhere about
18   so they decided to go in, and one sister slept in
19   one bed and the other slept in the other,
20   and later in the night one sister was awakened by
21   this squeeking sound
22   and she looked up and here was the madman
23   rocking back and forth in this rocker
24   with her sister's head in his lap,
25   and I told one
26   about how these two bums were in a skidrow room
27   and one bum sat on the floor and stuck his hand in his
28   mouth and ate his hand and then his arm and then ate the
29   other hand and soon ate himself up while the other bum
30   watched, and then the other bum sat on the floor and did
31   the same thing, and the story ends with this neon sign
32   blinking color off and on across the vacant floor ...
33   well, we went to sleep
34   and then we were awakened when all the lights came on
35   plus the radio and the t.v.,
36   and I said, oh god, life is back again,
37   and she said, well, we might as well sleep now,
38   and so I got up and turned everything off
39   and we closed our eyes
40   and she thought, there goes my immortal novel,
41   and I thought, there goes my immortal poem,

[Page 154 ]


42   everything depends upon some type of electricity,
43   the street lights kept me awake for 30 minutes,
44   then I dreamed that I ate matchsticks and lightbulbs
45   for a living and I was the best in my trade.

11   the tame rats become more beautiful
12   than long red hair,
13   my father's hands cut steak again
14   I roller skate before pygmies with green eyes,
15   the snake in the watermelon shakes the shopping cart,
16   we entered between the sheets which were as
17   delicious as miracles and walks in the park,
18   the hawk smiled daylight and nighttime,
19   we rode past frogs and elephants
20   past mines in mountains
21   past cripples working ouija boards,
22   she had toes on her feet
23   I had toes on my feet
24   we rode up and down and away
25   around,
26   it was sensible and pliable and holy
27   and felt very good
28   very very good,
29   the red lights blinked
30   the zepplin flew away
31   the war ended,
32   we stretched out then
33   and looked at the ceiling
34   a calm sea of a ceiling,
35   it was all right,
36   then we got back in the bathtub together
37   and french kissed
38   some more.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /style/ [from Mockingbird Wish Me Luck
        (1972) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   style is the answer to everything---
2   a fresh way to approach a dull or a
3   dangerous thing.
4   to do a dull thing with style
5   is preferable to doing a dangerous thing
6   without it.


7   Joan of Arc had style
8   John the Baptist
9   Christ
10   Socrates
11   Caesar,
12   Garcia Lorca.


13   style is the difference,
14   a way of doing,
15   a way of being done.


16   6 herons standing quietly in a pool of water
17   or you walking out of the bathroom naked
18   without seeing
19   me.

        (1972) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   we like to shower afterwards
2   (I like the water hotter than she)
3   and her face is always soft and peaceful
4   and she'll wash me first
5   spread the soap over my balls
6   lift the balls
7   squeeze them,
8   then wash the cock:
9   "hey, this thing is still hard!"
10   then get all the hair down there,---
11   the belly, the back, the neck, the legs,
12   I grin grin grin,
13   and then I wash her ...
14   first the cunt, I
15   stand behind her, my cock in the cheeks of her ass
16   I gently soap up the cunt hairs,
17   wash there with a soothing motion,
18   I linger perhaps longer than necessary,
19   then I get the backs of the legs, the ass,
20   the back, the neck, I turn her, kiss her,
21   soap up the breasts, get them and the belly, the neck,
22   the fronts of the legs, the ankles, the feet,
23   and then the cunt, once more, for luck ...
24   another kiss, and she gets out first,
25   toweling, sometimes singing while I stay in
26   turn the water on hotter
27   feeling the good times of love's miracle
28   I then get out ...
29   it is usually mid-afternoon and quiet,
30   and getting dressed we talk about what else
31   there might be to do,
32   but being together solves most of it,
33   in fact, solves all of it
34   for as long as those things stay solved
35   in the history of woman and
36   man, it's different for each
37   better and worse for each---
38   for me, it's splendid enough to remember
39   past the marching of armies
40   and the horses that walk the streets outside
41   past the memories of pain and defeat and unhappiness:

[Page 158 ]


42   Linda, you brought it to me,
43   when you take it away
44   do it slowly and easily
45   make it as if I were dying in my sleep instead of in
46   my life, amen.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /if we take/ --- [from Mockingbird Wish Me
        Luck (1972) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   if we take what we can see---
2   the engines driving us mad,
3   lovers finally hating;
4   this fish in the market
5   staring upward into our minds;
6   flowers rotting, flies web-caught;
7   riots, roars of caged lions,
8   clowns in love with dollar bills,
9   nations moving people like pawns;
10   daylight thieves with beautiful
11   nighttime wives and wines;
12   the crowded jails,
13   the commonplace unemployed,
14   dying grass, 2-bit fires;
15   men old enough to love the grave.


16   These things, and others, in content
17   show life swinging on a rotten axis.


18   But they've left us a bit of music
19   and a spiked show in the corner,
20   a jigger of scotch, a blue necktie,
21   a small volume of poems by Rimbaud,
22   a horse running as if the devil were
23   twisting his tail
24   over bluegrass and screaming, and then,
25   love again
26   like a streetcar turning the corner
27   on time,
28   the city waiting,
29   the wine and the flowers,
30   the water walking across the lake
31   and summer and winter and summer and summer
32   and winter again.

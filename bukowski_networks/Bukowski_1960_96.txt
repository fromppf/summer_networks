        Bukowski, Charles :  jam [from The Last Night of the Earth Poems
        (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   that Harbor Freeway south through the downtown
2   area---I mean, it can simply become
3   /unbelievable/ .


4   last Friday evening I was sitting there
5   motionless behind a wall of red taillights,
6   there wasn't even first gear movement
7   as masses of exhaust fumes
8   greyed the evening air, engines over-
9   heated
10   and there was the smell of a clutch
11   burning out
12   somewhere---
13   it seemed to come from ahead of me---
14   from that long slow rise of freeway where
15   the cars were working
16   from first gear to neutral
17   again and again
18   and from neutral back to
19   first gear.


20   on the radio I heard the news
21   of that day
22   at least 6 times, I was
23   well versed in world
24   affairs.
25   the remainder of the stations played a
26   thin, sick music.
27   the classical stations refused to come in
28   clearly
29   and when they did
30   it was a stale repetition of standard and
31   tiresome works.


32   I turned the radio off.
33   a strange whirling began in my
34   head---it circled behind the forehead, clock-

[Page 16 ]


35   wise, went past the ears and around to the
36   back of the head, then back to the forehead
37   and around
38   again.
39   I began to wonder, is this what happens
40   when one goes
41   mad?


42   I considered getting out of my car.
43   I was in the so-called fast
44   lane.
45   I could see myself out there
46   out of my car
47   leaning against the freeway divider,
48   arms folded.
49   then I would slide down to a sitting
50   position, putting my head between
51   my legs.


52   I stayed in the car, bit my tongue, turned
53   the radio back on, /willed/ the whirling to
54   stop
55   as I wondered if any of the others had to
56   battled against their
57   compulsions
58   as I did?


59   then the car ahead of me
60   MOVED
61   a foot, 2 feet, 3 feet!


62   I shifted to first gear ...
63   there was MOVEMENT!
64   then I was back in neutral
65   BUT
66   we /had moved/ from 7 to
67   ten feet.


68   hearing the world news for the
69   7th time,

[Page 17 ]


70   it was still all bad
71   but all of us listening,
72   we could handle that too
73   because we knew
74   that there was nothing worse than
75   looking at
76   that same license plate
77   that same dumb head sticking up
78   from behind the headrest
79   in the car ahead of you
80   as time dissolved
81   as the temperature gauge leaned
82   more to the right
83   as the gas gauge leaned
84   more to the left
85   as we wondered
86   /whose/ clutch was burning
87   out?


88   we were like some last, vast
89   final dinosaur
90   crawling feebly home somewhere,
91   somehow, maybe
92   to
93   die.

        Bukowski, Charles :  two toughs [from The Last Night of the
        Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   at L.A. City College there were two toughs, me and Jed
2   Anderson.
3   Anderson was one of the best running backs in the
4   history of the school, a real breakaway threat
5   anytime he got the football.
6   I was pretty tough physically but looked at sports
7   as a game for freaks.
8   I thought a bigger game was challenging those
9   who attempted to teach
10   us.


11   anyhow, Jed and I were the two biggest lights on
12   campus, he piled up his 60, 70 and 80 yard
13   runs in the night games
14   and during the days
15   slouched in my seat
16   I made up what I didn't know
17   and what I did know
18   was so bad
19   many a teacher was made to
20   dance to it.


21   and one grand day
22   Jed and I
23   finally met.
24   it was at a little jukebox place
25   across from campus and
26   he was sitting with his
27   pals
28   and I was sitting with
29   mine.


30   "go on! go on! talk to him!"
31   my pals
32   urged.
33   I said, "fuck that gym
34   boy. I am one with

[Page 19 ]


35   Nietzsche, let him come
36   over here!"


37   finally Jed got up to get a
38   pack of smokes from the
39   machine and one of my
40   friends asked,
41   "are you afraid of that
42   man?"


43   I got up and walked behind
44   Jed as he was reaching into the
45   machine
46   for his pack.


47   "hello, Jed," I
48   said.


49   he turned: "hello,
50   Hank."


51   then he reached into his
52   rear pocket,
53   pulled out a pint of
54   whiskey, handed it to
55   me.


56   I took a mighty hit,
57   handed it
58   back.


59   "Jed, what are you
60   going to do
61   after
62   L.A.C.C.?"


63   "I'm going to play
64   for Notre Dame."

[Page 20 ]




65   then he walked back
66   to his table
67   and I walked back
68   to mine.


69   "what'd he say? what'd
70   he say?"


71   "nothing much."


72   anyhow, Jed never made it
73   to Notre Dame
74   and I never made it
75   anywhere
76   either---
77   the years just swept us
78   away
79   but there were others
80   who went
81   on, including one fellow
82   who became a famous
83   sports columnist
84   and I had to look at his
85   photo
86   for decades
87   in the newspaper
88   as I inherited those
89   cheap rooms
90   and those roaches
91   and those airless
92   dreary
93   nights.


94   but
95   I was still proud of that moment
96   back then
97   when Jed handed me
98   that pint
99   and
100   I drained

[Page 21 ]


101   a third of it
102   with all the disciples
103   watching.
104   damn, there was no way
105   it seemed
106   we could ever
107   lose
108   but we did.


109   and it took me
110   3 or 4 decades to
111   move on just a
112   little.
113   and Jed,
114   if you are still here
115   tonight,
116   (I forgot to tell you
117   then)
118   here's a thanks
119   for that drink.


[Page 22 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  my German buddy [from The Last Night of the
        Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   tonight
2   drinking Singha
3   malt liquor from
4   Thailand
5   and listening to
6   Wagner


7   I can't believe that
8   he is not in
9   the other
10   room
11   or around the
12   corner
13   or alive
14   someplace
15   tonight


16   and he is
17   of course
18   as I am taken
19   by the sound of
20   him


21   and little goosebumps
22   run along
23   both of my
24   arms


25   then a
26   chill


27   he's here


28   now.


[Page 23 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  happy birthday [from The Last Night of the
        Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   when Wagner was an
2   old man
3   a birthday party was given
4   in his
5   honor
6   and a couple of
7   youthful
8   incidental compositions
9   were played.


10   afterwards
11   he asked,
12   "who wrote those?"


13   "you did," he was
14   told.


15   "ah," he responded,
16   "it's as I have always
17   suspected: death
18   then
19   does have some
20   virtue."


[Page 24 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  the telephone [from The Last Night of the
        Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   will bring you people
2   with its ring,
3   people who do not know what to do with
4   their time
5   and they will ache to
6   infect you with
7   this
8   from a distance
9   (although they would prefer
10   to actually be in the same room
11   to better project their nullity upon
12   you).


13   the telephone is needed for
14   emergency purposes only.


15   these people are not
16   emergencies, they are
17   calamities.


18   I have never welcomed the ring of a
19   telephone.


20   "hello," I will answer
21   guardedly.


22   "this is Dwight."


23   already you can feel their imbecile
24   yearning to invade.
25   they are the people-fleas that
26   crawl the
27   psyche.


28   "yes, what is it?"

[Page 25 ]




29   "well, I'm in town tonight and
30   I thought ..."


31   "listen, Dwight, I'm tied up, I
32   can't ..."


33   "well, maybe another
34   time?"


35   "maybe not ..."


36   each person is only given so many
37   evenings
38   and each wasted evening is
39   a gross violation against the
40   natural course of
41   your only
42   life;
43   besides, it leaves an aftertaste
44   which often lasts two or three days
45   depending upon the
46   visitor.


47   the telephone is only for
48   emergency purposes.


49   it has taken me
50   decades
51   but I have finally found out
52   how to say
53   "no."


54   now
55   don't be concerned for them,
56   please:
57   they will simply dial another
58   number.


59   it could be
60   yours.

[Page 26 ]




61   "hello," you will
62   say.


63   and they will say,
64   "this is Dwight."


65   and then
66   /you/
67   be
68   the kind
69   understanding
70   soul.


[Page 27 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  begging [from The Last Night of the Earth
        Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   like most of you, I've had so many jobs that
2   I feel as if I were gutted and my insides
3   thrown to the winds.
4   I've met some good people along the
5   way and also the
6   other kind.
7   yet when I think of all those
8   I have worked with---
9   even though decades have passed---
10   Karl
11   comes to mind
12   first.


13   I remember Karl: our jobs required we
14   both wear aprons
15   tied from behind and around
16   the neck with string.


17   I was Karl's underling.
18   "we got an easy job," he
19   told me.


20   each day as one by one our superiors arrived
21   Karl would make a slight bend at the waist,
22   smile, and with a nod of the head
23   greet each: "good morning Dr. Stein,"
24   or, "good morning Mr. Day" or
25   Mrs. Knight or if the lady was unattached
26   "good morning, Lilly" or Betty or Fran.


27   I never
28   spoke.


29   Karl seemed concerned at this and
30   one day he took me aside: "hey,
31   where the fuck else you going to get a

[Page 28 ]


32   two hour lunch like we
33   do?"


34   "nowhere, I guess ..."


35   "well, o.k., look, for guys like you and me,
36   this is as good as it can get, this is all
37   there is."


38   I waited.


39   "so look, it's hard to suck up to them at first, it
40   didn't come easy for me
41   but after a while I realized that it
42   didn't matter.
43   I just grew a shell.
44   now I've got my shell, got
45   it?"


46   I looked at him and sure enough he did look like he had
47   a shell, there was a mask-like look to his
48   face and the eyes were null, void and
49   undisturbed; I was looking at a weathered and
50   beaten conch.



51   some weeks went by.
52   nothing changed: Karl bowed and scraped and smiled
53   undaunted, perfect in his
54   role.
55   that we were /perishable/ , perhaps didn't occur to
56   him
57   or
58   that greater gods might be
59   watching.


60   I did my
61   work.

[Page 29 ]




62   then, one day, Karl took me
63   aside again.


64   "listen, Dr. Morely spoke to me
65   about you."


66   "yes?"


67   "he asked me what was wrong with
68   you."


69   "what did you tell
70   him?"


71   "I told him that you were
72   young."


73   "thanks."


74   upon receiving my next check, I
75   quit


76   but


77   still
78   had to
79   eventually settle for another similar
80   job
81   and
82   viewing the
83   new Karls
84   I finally forgave them all
85   but not myself:


86   being perishable sometimes makes a
87   man
88   strange
89   almost
90   unemployable

[Page 30 ]


91   most
92   obnoxious---
93   no servant of
94   free
95   enterprise.


[Page 31 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  the feel of it [from The Last Night of the
        Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   A. Huxley died at 69,
2   much too early for such a
3   fierce talent,
4   and I read all his
5   works
6   but actually
7   /Point Counter Point/
8   did help a bit
9   in carrying me through
10   the factories and the
11   drunk tanks and the
12   unsavory
13   ladies.
14   that
15   book
16   along with Hamsun's
17   /Hunger/
18   they helped a
19   bit.
20   great books are
21   the ones we
22   need.


23   I was astonished at
24   myself for liking the
25   Huxley book
26   but it did come from
27   such a rabid
28   beautiful
29   pessimistic
30   intellectualism,
31   and when I first
32   read /P.C.P./
33   I was living in a
34   hotel room
35   with a wild and

[Page 32 ]


36   crazy
37   alcoholic woman
38   who once threw
39   Pound's /Cantos/
40   at me
41   and missed,
42   as they did
43   with me.


44   I was working
45   as a packer
46   in a light fixture
47   plant
48   and once
49   during a drinking
50   bout
51   I told the lady,
52   "here, read this!"
53   (referring to
54   /Point Counter/
55   /Point/ .)


56   "ah, jam it up
57   your ass!" she
58   screamed at
59   me.


60   anyhow, 69 seemed
61   too early for Aldous
62   Huxley to
63   die.
64   but I guess it's
65   just as fair
66   as the death of a
67   scrubwoman
68   at the same
69   age.


70   it's just that
71   with those who

[Page 33 ]


72   help us
73   get on through,
74   then
75   all that light
76   dying, it works the
77   gut a bit---
78   scrubwomen, cab drivers,
79   cops, nurses, bank
80   robbers, priests,
81   fishermen, fry cooks,
82   jockeys and the
83   like
84   be
85   damned.


[Page 34 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  the greatest actor of our day [from The
        Last Night of the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   he's getting fatter and fatter,
2   almost bald
3   he has a wisp of hair
4   in the back
5   which he twists
6   and holds
7   with a rubber band.


8   he's got a place in the hills
9   and he's got a place in the
10   islands
11   and few people ever see
12   him.
13   some consider him the greatest
14   actor of our
15   day.


16   he has few friends, a
17   very few.
18   with them, his favorite
19   pastime is
20   eating.


21   at rare times he is reached
22   by telephone
23   usually
24   with an offer to act
25   in an exceptional (he's
26   told)
27   motion picture.


28   he answers in a very soft
29   voice:


30   "oh, no, I don't want to
31   make any more movies ..."

[Page 35 ]




32   "can we send you the
33   screenplay?"


34   "all right ..."


35   then
36   he's not heard from
37   again.


38   usually
39   what he and his few friends
40   do
41   after eating
42   (if the night is cold)
43   is to have a few drinks
44   and watch the screenplays
45   burn
46   in the fireplace.


47   or
48   after eating (on
49   warm evenings)
50   after a few
51   drinks
52   the screenplays
53   are taken
54   frozen
55   out of cold
56   storage.
57   he hands some
58   to his friends
59   keeps some
60   then
61   together
62   from the veranda
63   they toss them
64   like flying saucers
65   far out
66   into the spacious

[Page 36 ]


67   canyon
68   below.


69   then
70   they all go
71   back in
72   knowing
73   instinctively
74   that the screenplays
75   were
76   bad. (at least,
77   /he/ senses it and
78   they
79   accept
80   that.)


81   it's a real good
82   world
83   up there:
84   well-earned, self-
85   sufficient
86   and
87   hardly
88   dependent
89   upon the
90   variables.


91   there's
92   all that time
93   to eat
94   drink
95   and
96   wait on death
97   like
98   everybody
99   else.

        Bukowski, Charles :  days like razors, nights full of rats [from
        The Last Night of the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   as a very young man I divided an equal amount of time between
2   the bars and the libraries; how I managed to provide for
3   my other ordinary needs is the puzzle; well, I simply didn't
4   bother too much with that---
5   if I had a book or a drink then I didn't think too much of
6   other things---fools create their own
7   paradise.


8   in the bars, I thought I was a tough, I broke things, fought
9   other men, etc.


10   in the libraries it was another matter: I was quiet, went
11   from room to room, didn't so much read entire books
12   as parts of them: medicine, geology, literature and
13   philosophy. psychology, math, history, other things, put me
14   off. with music I was more interested in the music and in the
15   lives of the composers than in the technical aspects ...


16   however, it was with the philosophers that I felt a brotherhood:
17   Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, even old hard-to-read Kant;
18   I found Santayana, who was very popular at the time, to be
19   limp and a bore; Hegel you really had to dig for, especially
20   with a hangover; there are many I read who I have forgotten,
21   perhaps properly so, but I remember one fellow who wrote an
22   /entire/ book in which he proved /that the moon was not there/
23   and he did it so well that afterwards you thought, he's
24   absolutely right, the moon is /not/ there.


25   how the hell is a young man going to deign to work an
26   8 hour day when the moon isn't even there?
27   what else
28   might be missing?


29   and
30   I didn't like literature so much as I did the literary
31   critics; they were real pricks, those guys; they used
32   fine language, beautiful in its way, to call other

[Page 38 ]


33   critics, other writers, assholes. they
34   perked me up.


35   but it was the philosophers who satisfied
36   that need
37   that lurked somewhere within my confused skull: wading
38   through their excesses and their
39   clotted vocabulary
40   they still often
41   stunned
42   leaped out
43   with a flaming gambling statement that appeared to be
44   absolute truth or damned near
45   absolute truth,
46   and this certainty was what I was searching for in a daily
47   life that seemed more like a piece of
48   cardboard.


49   what great fellows those old dogs were, they got me past
50   days like razors and nights full of rats; and women
51   bargaining like auctioneers from hell.


52   my brothers, the philosophers, they spoke to me unlike
53   anybody on the streets or anywhere else; they
54   filled an immense void.
55   such good boys, ah, such good
56   boys!


57   yes, the libraries helped; in my other temple, the
58   bars, it was another matter, more simplistic, the
59   language and the way was
60   different ...


61   library days, bar nights.
62   the nights were alike,
63   there's some fellow sitting nearby, maybe not a
64   bad sort, but for me he doesn't shine right,
65   there's a gruesome deadness there---I think of my father,
66   of schoolteachers, of faces on coins and bills, of dreams
67   about murderers with dull eyes; well,

[Page 39 ]


68   somehow this fellow and I get to exchanging glances,
69   a fury slowly begins to gather: we are enemies, cat and
70   dog, priest and atheist, fire and water; tension builds,
71   block piled upon block, waiting for the crash; our hands
72   fold and unfold, we drink, now, finally with a
73   purpose:


74   his face turns to me:
75   "sumpin' ya don't like, buddy?"


76   "yeah. you."


77   "wanna do sumpin' about it?"


78   "certainly."


79   we finish our drinks, rise, move to the back of the
80   bar, out into the alley; we
81   turn, face each other.


82   I say to him, "there's nothing but space between us. you
83   care to close that
84   space?"


85   he rushes toward me and somehow it's a part of the part of the
86   part.

        Bukowski, Charles :  in and out of the dark [from The Last Night
        of the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   my wife likes movie houses, the popcorn and soft drinks, the
2   settling into seats, she finds a child's delight in
3   this and I am happy for her---but really, I myself, I must have
4   come from another place, I must have been a mole in another
5   life, something that burrowed and hid alone:
6   the other people crowded in the seats, near and far, give me
7   feelings that I dislike; it's stupid, maybe, but there it
8   is; and then
9   there's the darkness and then the
10   giant human faces, bodies, that move about on the screen, they
11   speak and we
12   listen.


13   of one hundred movies there's one that's fair, one that's good
14   and ninety eight that are very bad.
15   most movies start badly and steadily get
16   worse;
17   if you can believe the actions and speech of the
18   characters
19   you might even believe that the popcorn you chew also
20   has a meaning of
21   sorts.
22   (well, it might be that people see so many movies
23   that when they finally see one not
24   so bad as the others, they think it's
25   great. an Academy Award means that you don't stink
26   quite as much as your cousin.)


27   the movie ends and we are out in the street, moving
28   toward the car; "well," says my wife, "it wasn't as
29   good as they say."
30   "no," I say, "it wasn't."


31   "there were a few good parts, though," she replies.
32   "yeah," I answer.

[Page 41 ]




33   we are at the car, get in, then I am driving us out
34   of that part of town; we look around at the night;
35   the night looks good.


36   "you hungry?" she asks.


37   "yes. you?"


38   we stop at a signal; I watch the red light;
39   I could eat that red light---anything, anything at
40   all to fill the void; millions of dollars spent to create
41   something more terrible than the actual lives of
42   most living things; one should never have to pay an
43   admission to hell.


44   the light changes and we escape,
45   forward.

        Bukowski, Charles :  be kind [from The Last Night of the Earth
        Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   we are always asked
2   to understand the other person's
3   viewpoint
4   no matter how
5   out-dated
6   foolish or
7   obnoxious.


8   one is asked
9   to view
10   their total error
11   their life-waste
12   with
13   kindliness,
14   especially if they are
15   aged.


16   but age is the total of
17   our doing.
18   they have aged
19   badly
20   because they have
21   lived
22   out of focus,
23   they have refused to
24   see.


25   not their fault?


26   whose fault?
27   mine?


28   I am asked to hide
29   my viewpoint
30   from them

[Page 43 ]


31   for fear of their
32   fear.


33   age is no crime


34   but the shame
35   of a deliberately
36   wasted
37   life


38   among so many
39   deliberately
40   wasted
41   lives


42   is.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the man with the beautiful eyes [from The
        Last Night of the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   when we were kids
2   there was a strange house
3   all the shades were
4   always
5   drawn
6   and we never heard voices
7   in there
8   and the yard was full of
9   bamboo
10   and we liked to play in
11   the bamboo
12   pretend we were
13   Tarzan
14   (although there was no
15   Jane).
16   and there was a
17   fish pond
18   a large one
19   full of the
20   fattest goldfish
21   you ever saw
22   and they were
23   tame.
24   they came to the
25   surface of the water
26   and took pieces of
27   bread
28   from our hands.


29   our parents had
30   told us:
31   "never go near that
32   house."
33   so, of course,
34   we went.

[Page 45 ]




35   we wondered if anybody
36   lived there.
37   weeks went by and we
38   never saw
39   anybody.


40   then one day
41   we heard
42   a voice
43   from the house
44   "YOU GOD DAMNED
45   WHORE!"


46   it was a man's
47   voice.


48   then the screen
49   door
50   of the house was
51   flung open
52   and the man
53   walked
54   out.


55   he was holding a
56   fifth of whiskey
57   in his right
58   hand.
59   he was about
60   30.
61   he had a cigar
62   in his
63   mouth,
64   needed a
65   shave.
66   his hair was
67   wild and
68   uncombed
69   and he was
70   barefoot

[Page 46 ]


71   in undershirt
72   and pants.
73   but his eyes
74   were
75   bright.
76   they /blazed/
77   with
78   brightness
79   and he said,
80   "hey, little
81   gentlemen,
82   having a good
83   time, I
84   hope?"


85   then he gave a
86   little laugh
87   and walked
88   back into the
89   house.


90   we left,
91   went back to my
92   parents' yard
93   and thought
94   about it.


95   our parents,
96   we decided,
97   had wanted us
98   to stay away
99   from there
100   because they
101   never wanted us
102   to see a man
103   like
104   that,
105   a strong natural
106   man
107   with

[Page 47 ]


108   beautiful
109   eyes.


110   our parents
111   were ashamed
112   that they were
113   not
114   like that
115   man,
116   that's why they
117   wanted us
118   to stay
119   away.


120   but
121   we went back
122   to that house
123   and the bamboo
124   and the tame
125   goldfish.
126   we went back
127   many times
128   for many
129   weeks
130   but we never
131   saw
132   or heard
133   the man
134   again.


135   the shades were
136   down
137   as always
138   and it was
139   quiet.


140   then one day
141   as we came back from
142   school

[Page 48 ]


143   we saw the
144   house.


145   it had burned
146   down,
147   there was nothing
148   left,
149   just a smoldering
150   twisted black
151   foundation
152   and we went to
153   the fish pond
154   and there was
155   no water
156   in it
157   and the fat
158   orange goldfish
159   were dead
160   there,
161   drying out.


162   we went back to
163   my parents' yard
164   and talked about
165   it
166   and decided that
167   our parents had
168   burned their
169   house down,
170   had killed
171   them
172   had killed the
173   goldfish
174   because it was
175   all too
176   beautiful,
177   even the bamboo
178   forest had
179   burned.

[Page 49 ]




180   they had been
181   afraid of
182   the man with the
183   beautiful
184   eyes.


185   and
186   we were afraid
187   then
188   that
189   all throughout our lives
190   things like that
191   would
192   happen,
193   that nobody
194   wanted
195   anybody
196   to be
197   strong and
198   beautiful
199   like that,
200   that
201   others would never
202   allow it,
203   and that
204   many people
205   would have to
206   die.


[Page 50 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  a strange day [from The Last Night of the
        Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   it was one of those hot and tiring days at Hollywood
2   Park
3   with a huge crowd, a
4   tiring, rude, dumb
5   crowd.


6   I won the last race and stayed to collect and when I
7   got to my car
8   there was a massive jam of traffic attempting to
9   work its way out of there.


10   so I took my shoes off, sat and waited, turned on the
11   radio, lucked onto some classical music, found
12   a pint of Scotch in the glove compartment, un-
13   capped it, had a
14   hit.


15   I'm going to let them all get out of here, I
16   thought, then I'll
17   go.


18   I found ¾'s of a cigar, lit it, had another hit
19   of Scotch.


20   I listened to the music, smoked, drank the
21   Scotch and watched the losers
22   leave.


23   there was even a little crap game going
24   about 100 yards to the
25   east


26   then that
27   broke up.


28   I decided to finish the
29   pint.

[Page 51 ]




30   I did, then stretched out on the
31   seat.


32   I don't know how long I
33   slept
34   but when I awakened it was dark and
35   the parking lot was
36   empty.


37   I decided not to put on my shoes, started the car
38   and drove out of
39   there....


40   when I got back to my place I could hear the phone
41   ringing.


42   as I put the key in the door and opened it,
43   the phone kept
44   ringing.


45   I walked over, picked up the
46   phone.


47   "hello?"


48   "you son of a bitch, where have you
49   been?"


50   "the racetrack."


51   "the racetrack? it's 12:30 a.m.! I've been
52   phoning since
53   7 p.m.!"


54   "I just got in from the
55   racetrack."

[Page 52 ]




56   "you got some woman
57   there?"


58   "no."


59   "I don't believe you!"
60   she hung up.


61   I walked to the refrigerator, got a beer, went to
62   the bathroom, let the water run in the
63   tub.
64   I finished the beer, got another, opened it and
65   climbed into the
66   tub.


67   the phone rang
68   again.


69   I got out of the tub with my beer and
70   dripping away
71   I walked to the phone, picked it
72   up.


73   "hello?"


74   "you son of a bitch, I still don't
75   believe you!"


76   she hung up.


77   I walked back to the tub with my beer,
78   leaving another trail of
79   water.


80   as I got back into the tub
81   the phone rang
82   again.


83   I let it ring, counting the
84   rings: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,

[Page 53 ]


85   10,11,12,13,14,15,
86   16 ...


87   she hung up.


88   then, perhaps, 3 or 4 minutes
89   passed.


90   the phone rang
91   again.


92   I counted the rings:
93   1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,
94   9 ...


95   then it was
96   quiet.


97   about then I remembered I had
98   left my shoes in the
99   car.
100   no matter, except I only had
101   one pair.


102   chances were, though, that nobody
103   would ever want to steal that
104   car.


105   I got out of the tub for another
106   beer,
107   leaving another trail
108   behind me.


109   it was the end of a
110   long
111   long
112   day.

        Bukowski, Charles :  Trollius and trellises [from The Last Night
        of the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   of course, I may die in the next ten minutes
2   and I'm ready for that
3   but what I'm really worried about is
4   that my editor-publisher might retire
5   even though he is ten years younger than
6   I.
7   it was just 25 years ago (I was at that /ripe/
8   old age of 45)
9   when we began our unholy alliance to
10   test the literary waters,
11   neither of us being much
12   known.


13   I think we had some luck and still have some
14   of same
15   yet
16   the odds are pretty fair
17   that he will opt for warm and pleasant
18   afternoons
19   in the garden
20   long before I.


21   writing is its own intoxication
22   while publishing and editing,
23   attempting to collect bills
24   carries its own
25   attrition
26   which also includes dealing with the
27   petty bitchings and demands
28   of many
29   so-called genius darlings who are
30   not.


31   I won't blame him for getting
32   out
33   and hope he sends me photos of his
34   Rose Lane, his
35   Gardenia Avenue.

[Page 55 ]




36   will I have to seek other
37   promulgators?
38   that fellow in the Russian
39   fur hat?
40   or that beast in the East
41   with all that hair
42   in his ears, with those wet and
43   greasy lips?


44   or will my editor-publisher
45   upon exiting for that world of Trollius and
46   trellis
47   hand over the
48   machinery
49   of his former trade to a
50   cousin, a
51   daughter or
52   some Poundian from Big
53   Sur?


54   or will he just pass the legacy on
55   to the
56   Shipping Clerk
57   who will rise like
58   Lazarus,
59   fingering new-found
60   importance?


61   one can imagine terrible
62   things:
63   "Mr. Chinaski, all your work
64   must now be submitted in
65   Rondo form
66   and
67   typed
68   triple-spaced on rice
69   paper."


70   power corrupts,
71   life aborts

[Page 56 ]


72   and all you
73   have left
74   is a
75   bunch of
76   warts.


77   "no, no, Mr. Chinaski:
78   /Rondo/ form!"


79   "hey, man," I'll ask,
80   "haven't you heard of
81   the thirties?"


82   "the thirties? what's
83   that?"


84   my present editor-publisher
85   and I
86   at times
87   did discuss the thirties,
88   the Depression
89   and
90   some of the little tricks it
91   taught us---
92   like how to endure on almost
93   nothing
94   and move forward
95   anyhow.


96   well, John, if it happens enjoy your
97   divertissement to
98   plant husbandry,
99   cultivate and aerate
100   between
101   bushes, water only in the
102   early morning, spread
103   shredding to discourage
104   weed growth
105   and
106   as I do in my writing:

[Page 57 ]


107   use plenty of
108   manure.


109   and thank you
110   for locating me there at
111   5124 DeLongpre Avenue
112   somewhere between
113   alcoholism and
114   madness.


115   together we
116   laid down the gauntlet
117   and there are takers
118   even at this late date
119   still to be
120   found
121   as the fire sings
122   through the
123   trees.

        Bukowski, Charles :  air and light and time and space [from The
        Last Night of the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   "---you know, I've either had a family, a job, something
2   has always been in the
3   way
4   but now
5   I've sold my house, I've found this
6   place, a large studio, you should see the /space/ and
7   the /light/ .
8   for the first time in my life I'm going to have a place and the time to
9   /create/ ."


10   no baby, if you're going to create
11   you're going to create whether you work
12   16 hours a day in a coal mine
13   or
14   you're going to create in a small room with 3 children
15   while you're on
16   welfare,
17   you're going to create with part of your mind and your
18   body blown
19   away,
20   you're going to create blind
21   crippled
22   demented,
23   you're going to create with a cat crawling up your
24   back while
25   the whole city trembles in earthquake, bombardment,
26   flood and fire.


27   baby, air and light and time and space
28   have nothing to do with it
29   and don't create anything
30   except maybe a longer life to find
31   new excuses
32   for.

1   what will they be writing about 2,000 years from
2   now
3   if they are
4   here?


5   now
6   I drink cabernet sauvignon while
7   listening to
8   Bach: it's
9   most curious: this
10   continuing death
11   this
12   continuing life


13   as
14   I look at this hand
15   holding a cigarette
16   I feel as if
17   I have been here
18   forever.


19   now
20   troops with bayonets
21   sack
22   the town below.
23   my dog, Tony, smiles at
24   me.


25   it is well
26   to feel good
27   for no reason;
28   or
29   with a limited
30   choice to
31   choose
32   anyhow;
33   or with a little love,

[Page 60 ]


34   not to buckle to
35   hatred.
36   faith, brother, not in the
37   gods
38   but in
39   yourself:
40   don't ask,
41   tell.


42   I tell you
43   such fine
44   music
45   waits
46   in the
47   shadows
48   of
49   hell.

        Bukowski, Charles :  bright red car [from The Last Night of the
        Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I try to avoid speed duels on the freeway but the most curious thing
2   is
3   that all my speeding tickets are when I am quietly driving along on
4   my
5   own.


6   when I am in a high speed duel, darting in and out of lanes
7   at near 100 m.p.h.
8   the police are never
9   about.


10   when I get tagged for speeding it is for cruising along,
11   day-dreaming, at a mere 70
12   m.p.h.


13   I received 3 such nonsensical tickets in 3 weeks so
14   I laid low for some time---2 years, in fact, but today
15   out there
16   there was a fellow in a bright red car, I have no idea what
17   model or kind
18   and I have no idea of how it all started but I believe that
19   I started it:
20   I was in the fast lane going about 70
21   and I caught the flash of bright red in my rear view and
22   as he swung out to pass me on the right
23   he was doing 75
24   and there was time for him to pass
25   then cut into the fast lane ahead of me
26   but /something/ made me hit the throttle and cut him
27   off
28   locking him in behind an old lady with a CHRIST
29   SAVES bumper sticker.
30   this seemed to piss him no end
31   and next I knew he had swung over on my bumper,
32   so close that his windshield and my taillights
33   seemed one.

[Page 62 ]




34   this pissed /me/ no end and I was being blocked by a
35   green Volks directly ahead
36   but I cut right through an opening and shot
37   ahead.
38   bright red went wild, spotted the far lane open,
39   roared over and gunned it
40   along.


41   after that, it was just me and bright red
42   jockeying for spots.


43   he would garner a lead, then with a crazy gamble
44   of lane change I would regain the
45   lead.


46   during this duel my destination was forgotten and I'm
47   sure his was
48   too.


49   watching him, I couldn't help but admire his driving
50   skill; he took a few more chances than I
51   but I had a little bit the better machine
52   so it
53   just about evened out.


54   then
55   suddenly
56   we were alone: a freak break in the traffic
57   had set us free together
58   and we really opened
59   up.


60   he had a short lead but my machine slowly gained; I
61   inched up near him,
62   then I was at his side and I couldn't help but
63   look over.


64   he was a young Japanese-American, maybe 18, 19
65   and I looked at him and
66   laughed.

[Page 63 ]




67   I saw him check me out.
68   he saw a 70 year old white man
69   with a face like
70   Frankenstein.


71   the young man took his foot off the throttle and
72   dropped back.


73   I let him go.


74   I turned the radio
75   on.


76   I was 18 miles past my destination but it
77   didn't matter.


78   it was a beautiful sunny day.

        Bukowski, Charles :  moving toward the 21st century [from The
        Last Night of the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   it was a New Year's Eve party at my place
2   I think.
3   I was standing holding a drink when
4   this slender young fellow walked up
5   he was a bit drunk he said


6   "Hank, I met a woman who said
7   she was married to you for 2
8   years."


9   "really?
10   what was her
11   name?"


12   "Lola
13   Edwards."


14   "never heard of
15   her."


16   "ah, come on, man, she
17   said ..."


18   "don't know her,
19   baby ..."


20   in fact I didn't know who
21   /he/ was ...


22   I drained my drink walked to the kitchen
23   poured a refill


24   I looked around yes, I was at my place
25   I recognized the
26   kitchen.

[Page 65 ]




27   another
28   Happy New Year.


29   Jesus.


30   I walked out to face the
31   people.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the lady and the mountain lion [from The
        Last Night of the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   it was hardly a wilderness area
2   but it was countryside
3   and there had been a paucity of
4   rainfall---also some housing
5   construction on the
6   hillsides.


7   small game was dying
8   out.
9   the coyotes were the first of
10   the famished to
11   arrive
12   looking for
13   chickens
14   cats
15   anything.


16   in fact, a group attacked
17   a man on horseback
18   tearing his arm
19   but he
20   escaped.


21   then
22   in a park
23   there was the lady who
24   left her car to
25   go to the public
26   restroom.


27   she had closed the stall
28   door
29   when she heard a
30   soft
31   sound,
32   the stealth of

[Page 67 ]


33   padded
34   feet.


35   then
36   as she sat there
37   the mountain lion stuck
38   his head under the
39   stall door.


40   a truly beautiful
41   animal.


42   then
43   the head withdrew, the cat
44   knocked over a trash can, circled,
45   emitted a slow
46   growl.


47   the lady climbed up
48   on the toilet
49   then grasped an overhead
50   pipe
51   and
52   swung herself completely up
53   (fear creates abnormal
54   acts) and sat where
55   she could watch
56   the cat.


57   at once
58   the cat put his
59   paws up
60   on the wash basin
61   stuck his head in
62   there
63   and lapped at a dripping
64   spigot.


65   then
66   he sank

[Page 68 ]


67   low upon the floor
68   crouched
69   facing the doorway


70   then
71   /zing/
72   was gone
73   out of there.


74   then
75   at last
76   the lady began
77   screaming.


78   when the people
79   arrived
80   the cat was nowhere to be
81   seen.


82   the story made the
83   newspapers and the television
84   stations.


85   the story that won't be told is
86   that the lady
87   will never go to the bathroom
88   again
89   without thinking of a
90   mountain
91   lion.


92   a truly beautiful
93   animal.

        Bukowski, Charles :  a laugh a minute [from The Last Night of
        the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   come on, let's go see him, this old guy is a
2   kick in the ass, 50 years old, he sits around
3   in his shorts and underwear
4   drinking wine out of this chipped white
5   cup.
6   he sits with the shades pulled down and
7   he's never owned a tv set.
8   the only time he goes out is for more
9   wine
10   or to the racetrack in his baby blue
11   '58 Comet.


12   you get there and he's distraught, some woman
13   has always left forever and
14   he pretends to play it with bravado but
15   his little slit eyes are filled with
16   pain.


17   he'll pour drinks all around, he just gulps
18   that crap down and then sometimes he'll
19   get up and puke.
20   it's really something. you
21   can hear him for blocks.
22   then he'll come out and pour another
23   drink.
24   he'll go on and on drinking
25   and then once in a while he'll say something
26   crazy like, "anything 3 dogs can do, 4 dogs
27   can do better!"
28   other things too.
29   or he'll smash a glass or a bottle against
30   the wall.


31   he worked as an orderly in a
32   hospital for 15 years
33   then quit.

[Page 70 ]


34   he never sleeps at night.


35   and for a guy that ugly
36   I don't see how he gets all his
37   women.
38   and he's jealous.
39   just look at one of his women
40   and he'll swing on you.


41   then he gets drunk and tells crazy
42   stories and sings.
43   and guess what? he writes
44   poetry.


45   come on, let's go see him, this old guy
46   is a kick in the
47   ass!

        Bukowski, Charles :  hello, Hamsun [from The Last Night of the

1   after two-and-one-half bottles
2   that have not strengthened my saddened
3   heart


4   walking from this drunken
5   darkness
6   toward the bedroom
7   thinking of Hamsun who
8   ate his own flesh to
9   gain time to
10   write


11   I trundle into the other
12   room
13   an old
14   man


15   a hellfish in the night
16   swimming upward
17   sideways
18   down.

        Bukowski, Charles :  death is smoking my cigars [from The Last
        Night of the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   you know: I'm drunk once again
2   here
3   listening to Tchaikovsky
4   on the radio.
5   Jesus, I heard him 47 years
6   ago
7   when I was a starving writer
8   and here he is
9   again
10   and now I am a minor success as
11   a writer
12   and death is walking
13   up and down
14   this room
15   smoking my cigars
16   taking hits of my
17   wine
18   as Tchaik is working away
19   at the /Pathétique/ ,
20   it's been some journey
21   and any luck I've had was
22   because I rolled the dice
23   right:
24   I starved for my art, I starved to
25   gain 5 god-damned minutes, 5 hours,
26   5 days---
27   I just wanted to get the word
28   down;
29   fame, money, didn't matter:
30   /I/ wanted the word down
31   and /they/ wanted me at a punch press,
32   a factory assembly line
33   they wanted me to be a stock boy in a
34   department store.


35   well, death says, as he walks by,
36   I'm going to get you anyhow

[Page 73 ]


37   no matter what you've been:
38   writer, cab-driver, pimp, butcher,
39   sky-diver, I'm going to get
40   you ...


41   o.k. baby, I tell him.


42   we drink together now
43   as one a.m. slides to 2
44   a.m. and
45   only he knows the
46   moment, but I worked a con
47   on him: I got my
48   5 god-damned minutes
49   and much
50   more.


[Page 74 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  hock shops [from The Last Night of the
        Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   were always all right with me
2   because when I tried to sell something in the street
3   there were no takers.


4   of course, the shops offered far less than real value;
5   they had to profit on the
6   resale,
7   but at least, they were
8   there.


9   my favorite shop was a place in Los Angeles---
10   this fellow would lead me to a booth where
11   he would gather a black curtain all around
12   us,
13   it slid on little rings
14   and then
15   we would be enclosed.


16   and it always went like
17   this:


18   "show me," he would
19   say.


20   I would place the item on the table under
21   the very strong
22   light.


23   he would examine the item, then look at me
24   for some time.


25   "I can't give you very much for
26   this."


27   another pause, then he would name his
28   price.

[Page 75 ]




29   the offer was always more than I
30   expected.


31   "I'll take $10," I would name a
32   higher price.


33   "no," he would answer, "in fact ..."
34   and then he would mention a lower price
35   than his original
36   offer.


37   at times I would attempt to joke with
38   him:


39   "if I stay here long enough, I'll be
40   paying /you/ ..."


41   he wouldn't smile.


42   "we don't have to do business at
43   all."


44   "listen, I'll accept your /first/
45   offer ..."


46   "very well," he would say,
47   "but I will /lose/ on
48   this ..."


49   then he would write out the
50   pawn ticket and give me the
51   money.


52   "please be sure to read your ticket,
53   there are
54   stipulations."


55   then he would turn off the light
56   and pull the black curtain
57   away ...

[Page 76 ]




58   sometimes I was able to retrieve one
59   of the items
60   but eventually they all returned
61   forever.


62   also, I found out that the one thing
63   you /could/ sell in the bars and on the
64   street were
65   hock shop tickets.


66   the hock shops helped me through some terrible
67   times and I was glad they were
68   there when nothing else
69   was, and that booth with the black
70   curtain: what a marvelous sanctuary,
71   a place to give up something for
72   something else that you needed
73   much more.


74   how many typewriters, suits, gloves and
75   watches I left in the hock shops
76   I have no
77   idea,
78   but those places were always
79   all right
80   with me.


[Page 77 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  hell is a closed door [from The Last Night
        of the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   even when starving
2   the rejection slips hardly ever bothered me:
3   I only believed that the editors were
4   truly stupid
5   and I just went on and wrote more and
6   more.
7   I even considered rejects as
8   /action/ ; the worst was the empty
9   mailbox.


10   if I had a weakness or a dream
11   it was
12   that I only wanted to /see/ one of these
13   editors
14   who rejected me,
15   to /see/ his or her face, the way they
16   dressed, the way they walked across a
17   room, the sound of their voice, the look
18   in their eye ...
19   just /one/ look at /one/ of
20   them---


21   you see, when all you look at is
22   a piece of printed paper
23   telling you that you
24   aren't very good,
25   then there is a tendency
26   to think that the editors
27   are more god-like than
28   they are.


29   hell is a closed door
30   when you're starving for your god-
31   damned art
32   but sometimes you feel at least like having a
33   peek through the
34   keyhole.

[Page 78 ]




35   young or old, good or bad,
36   I don't think anything dies as slow and
37   as hard as a
38   writer.

        Bukowski, Charles :  pulled down shade [from The Last Night of
        the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   what I like about you
2   she told me
3   is that you're crude---
4   look at you sitting there
5   a beercan in your hand
6   and a cigar in your mouth
7   and look at
8   your dirty hairy belly
9   sticking out from
10   under your shirt.
11   you've got your shoes off
12   and you've got a hole
13   in your right stocking
14   with the big toe
15   sticking out.
16   you haven't shaved in
17   4 or 5 days.
18   your teeth are yellow
19   and your eyebrows
20   hang down
21   all twisted
22   and you've got enough
23   scars
24   to scare the shit
25   out of anybody.
26   there's always
27   a ring
28   in your bathtub
29   your telephone
30   is covered with
31   grease
32   and
33   half the crap in
34   your refrigerator is
35   rotten.
36   you never
37   wash your car.

[Page 80 ]


38   you've got newspapers
39   a week old
40   on the floor.
41   you read dirty
42   magazines
43   and you don't have
44   a tv
45   but you order
46   deliveries from the
47   liquor store
48   and you tip
49   good.
50   and best of all
51   you don't push
52   a woman to
53   go to bed
54   with you.
55   you seem hardly
56   interested
57   and when I talk to you
58   you don't
59   say anything
60   you just
61   look around
62   the room or
63   scratch your
64   neck
65   like you don't
66   hear me.
67   you've got an old
68   wet towel in
69   the sink
70   and a photo of
71   Mussolini
72   on the wall
73   and you never
74   complain
75   about anything
76   and you never
77   ask questions

[Page 81 ]


78   and I've
79   known you for
80   6 months
81   but I have
82   no idea
83   who you are.
84   you're like
85   some
86   pulled down shade
87   but that's what
88   I like about
89   you:
90   your crudeness:
91   a woman can
92   drop
93   out of your
94   life and
95   forget you
96   real fast.
97   a woman
98   can't go anywhere
99   but UP
100   after
101   leaving you,
102   honey.
103   you've got to
104   be
105   the best thing
106   that ever
107   happened
108   to
109   a girl

        Bukowski, Charles :  before Aids [from The Last Night of the
        Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I'm glad I got to them
2   all, I'm glad I got so many of them
3   in.


4   I flipped them
5   poked them
6   gored them.


7   so many high-heeled shoes
8   under my bed
9   it looked like a January
10   Clearance Sale.


11   the cheap hotel rooms,
12   the drunken fights,
13   the phones ringing,
14   the walls banging


15   I was
16   wild
17   red-eyed
18   big-balled
19   unshaven
20   poor
21   foul-mouthed
22   I laughed
23   plenty


24   and I picked them off
25   the barstools
26   like
27   ripe plums.


28   dirty sheets
29   bad whiskey
30   bad breath
31   cheap cigars

[Page 84 ]


32   and to hell with the next
33   morning.


34   I always slept with my
35   wallet under my
36   pillow
37   bedded down with the
38   depressed and the
39   crazies.


40   I was barred from half the
41   hotels in
42   Los Angeles.


43   I'm glad I got to them all,
44   I plugged and banged and
45   sang and
46   some of them
47   sang with me
48   on those glorious
49   3 a.m. mornings.
50   when the cops
51   arrived, that was
52   grand,
53   we barricaded the doors
54   and taunted
55   them
56   and they never waited around
57   until noon
58   (checking-out time) to
59   arrest us,
60   we weren't that
61   important


62   but
63   I thought we were
64   walking toward the bar,
65   and what a place the bar was
66   around noon, so quiet and
67   empty,

[Page 85 ]


68   a place to begin
69   again,
70   to buck up with a quiet
71   beer,
72   looking out across at the
73   park
74   with the ducks over there
75   and the tall trees
76   over there.


77   so,
78   always broke but always
79   money from somewhere,
80   I waited
81   getting ready to
82   plug and bang and poke
83   and sing again
84   in those good old times
85   in those very very very
86   good old times
87   before Aids.

        Bukowski, Charles :  hunk of rock [from The Last Night of the
        Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   Nina was the hardest of them
2   all,
3   the worst woman I had known
4   up to that moment
5   and I was sitting in front of
6   my secondhand black and white
7   tv
8   watching the news
9   when I heard a suspicious
10   sound in the kitchen
11   and I ran out there
12   and saw her with
13   a full bottle of whiskey---
14   a 5th---
15   and she had it and
16   was headed for the back porch
17   door
18   but I caught her and
19   grabbed at the bottle.
20   "give me that bottle, you
21   fucking whore!"
22   and we wrestled for the
23   bottle
24   and let me tell you
25   she gave me a good fight
26   for it
27   but
28   I got it away from her
29   and I told her to
30   get her ass out of
31   there.
32   she lived in the same place
33   in the back
34   upstairs.


35   I locked the door
36   took the bottle and a

[Page 87 ]


37   glass
38   went out to the couch
39   sat down and
40   opened the bottle and
41   poured myself a good
42   one.


43   I shut off the tv and
44   sat there
45   thinking about what a
46   hard number
47   Nina was.
48   I came up with
49   at least
50   a dozen lousy things
51   she had done
52   to me.


53   what a whore.
54   what a hunk of rock.


55   I sat there drinking
56   the whiskey
57   and wondering
58   what I was doing
59   with Nina.


60   then there was a
61   knock on the
62   door.
63   it was Nina's friend,
64   Helga.


65   "where's Nina?"
66   she asked.


67   "she tried to steal
68   my whiskey, I
69   ran her ass
70   out of here."

[Page 88 ]




71   "she said to meet
72   her here."


73   "what for?"


74   "she said me and her
75   were going to do it
76   in front of you
77   for $50."


78   "$25."


79   "she said $50."


80   "well, she's not
81   here ... want a
82   drink?"


83   "sure ..."


84   I got Helga a glass
85   poured her a
86   whiskey.
87   she took a
88   hit.


89   "maybe," she said,
90   "I ought to go get
91   Nina."


92   "I don't want to see
93   her."


94   "why not?"


95   "she's a whore."


96   Helga finished her
97   drink and I poured
98   her another.

[Page 89 ]


99   she took a
100   hit.


101   "Benny calls me a
102   whore, I'm no
103   whore."


104   Benny was the guy
105   she was shacked
106   with.


107   "I know you're no
108   whore, Helga."


109   "thanks. Ain't ya got no
110   music?"


111   "just the radio ..."


112   she saw it
113   got up
114   turned it
115   on.
116   some music came
117   blaring out.


118   Helga began to
119   dance
120   holding her whiskey
121   glass in one
122   hand.
123   she wasn't a good
124   dancer
125   she looked
126   ridiculous.


127   she stopped
128   drained her drink
129   rolled her glass along the
130   rug

[Page 90 ]


131   then ran toward
132   me
133   dropped to her knees
134   unzipped me
135   and then
136   she was down
137   there
138   doing tricks.


139   I drained my
140   drink
141   poured another.


142   she was
143   good.
144   she had a college
145   degree
146   some place back
147   East.


148   "get it, Helga, get
149   it!"


150   there was a loud
151   knock
152   on the front
153   door.


154   "HANK, IS HELGA
155   THERE?"


156   "WHO?"


157   "HELGA!"


158   "JUST A MINUTE!"


159   "THIS IS NINA, I WAS
160   SUPPOSED TO MEET
161   HELGA HERE, WE HAVE A

[Page 91 ]


162   LITTLE SURPRISE FOR
163   YOU!"


164   "YOU TRIED TO STEAL
165   MY WHISKEY, YOU
166   WHORE!"


167   "HANK, LET ME
168   IN!"


169   "get it, Helga, get
170   it!"


171   "HANK!"


172   "Helga, you fucking whore ...
173   Helga! Helga! Helga!!"


174   I pulled away and
175   got up.


176   "let her in."


177   I went to the
178   bathroom.


179   when I came out they
180   were both sitting there
181   drinking and smoking
182   laughing about
183   something.
184   then they
185   saw me.


186   "50 bucks," said Nina.


187   "25 bucks," I said.

[Page 92 ]




188   "we won't do it
189   then."


190   "don't then."


191   Nina inhaled
192   exhaled.
193   "all right, you
194   cheap bastard, 25
195   bucks!"


196   Nina stood up and
197   began taking her
198   clothes off.


199   she was the hardest
200   of them
201   all.


202   Helga stood up and
203   began taking her
204   clothes off.


205   I poured a
206   drink.
207   "sometimes I wonder
208   what the hell is
209   going on
210   around here," I
211   said.


212   "don't worry about
213   it, Daddy, just
214   get with it!"


215   "just what am I
216   supposed to
217   do?"

[Page 93 ]




218   "just do
219   whatever the fuck
220   you feel
221   like doing,"
222   said Nina
223   her big ass
224   blazing
225   in the
226   lamplight.

        Bukowski, Charles :  dinner, 1933 [from The Last Night of the
        Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   when my father ate
2   his lips became
3   greasy
4   with food.


5   and when he ate
6   he talked about how
7   /good/
8   the food was
9   and that
10   most other people
11   didn't eat
12   as good
13   as we
14   did.


15   he liked to
16   sop up
17   what was left
18   on his plate
19   with a piece of
20   bread,
21   meanwhile making
22   appreciative sounds
23   rather like
24   half-
25   grunts.


26   he /slurped/ his
27   coffee
28   making loud
29   bubbling
30   sounds.
31   then he'd put
32   the cup
33   down:

[Page 96 ]


34   "dessert? is it
35   jello?"


36   my mother would
37   bring it
38   in a large bowl
39   and my father would
40   spoon it
41   out.


42   as it plopped
43   in the dish
44   the jello made
45   strange sounds,
46   almost fart-
47   like
48   sounds.


49   then came the
50   whipped cream,
51   mounds of it
52   on the
53   jello.


54   "ah! jello and
55   whipped cream!"


56   my father sucked the
57   jello and whipped
58   cream
59   off his spoon---
60   it sounded as if it
61   was entering a
62   wind
63   tunnel.


64   finished with
65   that
66   he would wipe his
67   mouth

[Page 97 ]


68   with a huge white
69   napkin,
70   rubbing hard
71   in circular
72   motions,
73   the napkin almost
74   hiding his
75   entire
76   face.


77   after that
78   out came the
79   Camel
80   cigarettes.
81   he'd light one
82   with a wooden
83   kitchen match,
84   then place the
85   match,
86   still burning,
87   onto an
88   ashtray.


89   then a slurp of
90   coffee, the cup
91   back down, and a good
92   drag on the
93   Camel.


94   "ah that was a
95   /good/
96   meal!"


97   moments later
98   in my bedroom
99   on my bed
100   in the dark
101   the food that I
102   had eaten
103   and what I had

[Page 98 ]


104   seen
105   was already
106   making me
107   ill.


108   the only good
109   thing
110   was
111   listening to
112   the crickets
113   out there,
114   out there
115   in another world
116   I didn't
117   live
118   in.

        Bukowski, Charles :  such luck [from The Last Night of the Earth
        Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   we were at this table,
2   men and women,
3   after dinner.
4   somehow
5   the conversation got
6   around to
7   PMS.
8   one of the ladies
9   stated firmly that
10   the only cure for
11   PMS
12   was old
13   age.
14   there were other
15   remarks
16   that I have
17   forgotten,
18   except for one
19   which came from this
20   German guest
21   once married,
22   now divorced.
23   also, I had seen
24   him with
25   any number of
26   beautiful young
27   girlfriends.
28   anyhow, after quietly
29   listening
30   to our conversation
31   for some time
32   he asked us,
33   "what's PMS?"


34   now here was one
35   truly touched

[Page 100 ]


36   by
37   the angels.


38   the light was so
39   bright
40   we
41   all looked
42   away.

        Bukowski, Charles :  flophouse [from The Last Night of the Earth
        Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   you haven't lived
2   until you've been in a
3   flophouse
4   with nothing but one
5   light bulb
6   and 56 men
7   squeezed together
8   on cots
9   with everybody
10   snoring
11   at once
12   and some of those
13   snores
14   so
15   deep and
16   gross and
17   unbelievable---
18   dark
19   snotty
20   gross
21   subhuman
22   wheezings
23   from hell
24   itself.


25   your mind
26   almost breaks
27   under those
28   death-like
29   sounds


30   and the
31   intermingling
32   odors:
33   hard
34   unwashed socks
35   pissed and

[Page 102 ]


36   shitted
37   underwear


38   and over it all
39   slowly circulating
40   air
41   much like that
42   emanating from
43   uncovered
44   garbage
45   cans.


46   and those
47   bodies
48   in the dark


49   fat and
50   thin
51   and
52   bent


53   some
54   legless
55   armless


56   some
57   mindless


58   and worst of
59   all:
60   the total
61   absence of
62   hope


63   it shrouds
64   them
65   covers them
66   totally.

[Page 103 ]




67   it's not
68   bearable.


69   you get
70   up


71   go out


72   walk the
73   streets


74   up and
75   down
76   sidewalks


77   past buildings


78   around the
79   corner


80   and back
81   up
82   the same
83   street


84   thinking


85   those men
86   were all
87   children
88   once


89   what has happened
90   to
91   them?


92   and what has
93   happened
94   to
95   me?

[Page 104 ]




96   it's dark
97   and cold
98   out
99   here.

        Bukowski, Charles :  hand-outs [from The Last Night of the Earth

1   sometimes I am hit
2   for change
3   3 or 4 times
4   in twenty minutes
5   and nine times out of
6   ten I'll
7   give.
8   the time or two
9   that I don't
10   I have an instinctive
11   reaction
12   not to
13   and I
14   don't
15   but mostly I
16   dig and
17   give
18   but each time
19   I can't help but
20   remember
21   the many times
22   hollow-eyed
23   my skin tight to the
24   ribs
25   my mind airy and
26   mad
27   I never asked
28   anybody
29   for anything
30   and it wasn't
31   pride
32   it was simply because
33   I didn't respect
34   them
35   didn't regard them
36   as worthy human
37   beings.

[Page 106 ]


38   they were the
39   enemy
40   and they still are
41   as I dig
42   in
43   and
44   give.

        Bukowski, Charles :  waiting [from The Last Night of the Earth
        Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   hot summers in the mid-30's in Los Angeles
2   where every 3rd lot was vacant
3   and it was a short ride to the orange
4   groves---
5   if you had a car and the
6   gas.


7   hot summers in the mid-30's in Los Angeles
8   too young to be a man and too old to
9   be a boy.


10   hard times.
11   a neighbor tried to rob our
12   house, my father caught him
13   climbing through the
14   window,
15   held him there in the dark
16   on the floor:
17   "you rotten son of a
18   bitch!"


19   "Henry, Henry, let me go,
20   let me go!"


21   "you son of a bitch, I'll kill
22   you!"


23   my mother phoned the police.


24   another neighbor set his house on fire
25   in an attempt to collect the
26   insurance.
27   he was investigated and
28   jailed.


29   hot summers in the mid-30's in Los Angeles,
30   nothing to do, nowhere to go, listening to

[Page 108 ]


31   the terrified talk of our parents
32   at night:
33   "what will we do? what will we
34   do?"


35   "god, I don't know ..."


36   starving dogs in the alleys, skin taut
37   across ribs, hair falling out, tongues
38   out, such sad eyes, sadder than any sadness
39   on earth.


40   hot summers in the mid-30's in Los Angeles,
41   the men of the neighborhood were quiet
42   and the women were like pale
43   statues.


44   the parks full of socialists,
45   communists, anarchists, standing on the park
46   benches, orating, agitating.


47   the sun came down through a clear sky and
48   the ocean was clean
49   and we were
50   neither men nor
51   boys.


52   we fed the dogs leftover pieces of dry hard
53   bread
54   which they ate gratefully,
55   eyes shining in
56   wonder,
57   tails waving at such
58   luck


59   as
60   World War II moved toward us,
61   even then, during those
62   hot summers in the mid-30's in Los Angeles.

        Bukowski, Charles :  those mornings [from The Last Night of the
        Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I still remember those New Orleans rats
2   out on the balcony railings
3   in the dark of early morning
4   as I stood waiting my turn at the
5   crapper.
6   there were always two or three
7   big ones
8   just sitting there---sometimes they'd
9   move quickly then
10   stop and sit there.
11   I looked at them and they looked at
12   me.
13   they showed no fear.


14   at last the crapper door would open
15   and out would walk
16   one of the tenants
17   and he always looked worse than
18   the rats
19   and then he'd be gone
20   down the hallway
21   and I'd go into the still-
22   stinking crapper
23   with my hangover.


24   and almost always
25   when I came out
26   the rats would be gone.
27   as soon as it got a little light
28   they would
29   vanish.


30   and then
31   the world would be
32   mine,
33   I'd walk down the stairway
34   and into it

[Page 110 ]


35   and my low-wage
36   pitiful
37   job
38   while remembering the
39   rats,
40   how it was better for them
41   than for
42   me.


43   I walked to work as the sun
44   came up hot
45   and the whores slept
46   like
47   babies.

        Bukowski, Charles :  everything you touch [from The Last Night
        of the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   putting on your torn clothes in an old New Orleans roominghouse,
2   you and your stockboy soul,
3   then rolling your little green wagon past the salesgirls who
4   took no notice of you, those girls dreaming of bigger
5   game with their tiny rectangular
6   brains.


7   or in Los Angeles, coming in from your shipping clerk job at
8   an auto parts warehouse, taking the elevator up to 319 to find
9   your woman sprawled out on the bed, drunk at
10   6 p.m.


11   you were never any good at picking them, you always got the
12   leftovers, the crazies, the alkies, the pill-freaks.
13   maybe that was all you could get and maybe you were all they
14   could get.


15   you went to the bars and found more alkies, pill-freaks, crazies.
16   all they had to show you were a pair of well-turned ankles in
17   spike-heeled shoes.
18   you thumped up and down on beds with them as if you had
19   discovered
20   the meaning of
21   existence.


22   then there was this day at work when Larry the salesman came
23   down the
24   aisle with his big belly and his little button eyes, Larry always
25   walked loudly on leather-soled shoes and he was almost always
26   whistling.


27   he stopped whistling and stood at your shipping table as you
28   worked.


29   then he began rocking back and forth, he had this habit and
30   he stood there rocking, observing you, he was one of those jokers,
31   you

[Page 112 ]


32   know, and then he began laughing, you were sick from a long crazy
33   night, needed a shave, you were dressed in a torn shirt.


34   "what is it, Larry?" you asked.


35   and then he said, "Hank, everything you touch turns to shit!"


36   you couldn't argue with him about that.

        Bukowski, Charles :  car wash [from The Last Night of the Earth
        Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   got out, fellow said, "hey!" walked toward
2   me, we shook hands, he slipped me 2 red
3   tickets for free car washes, "find you later,"
4   I told him, walked on through to waiting
5   area with wife, we sat on outside bench.
6   black fellow with a limp came up, said,
7   "hey, man, how's it going?"
8   I answered, "fine, bro, you makin' it?"
9   "no problem," he said, then walked off to
10   dry down a Caddy.
11   "these people know you?" my wife asked.
12   "no."
13   "how come they talk to you?"
14   "they like me, people have always liked me,
15   it's my cross."
16   then our car was finished, fellow flipped
17   his rag at me, we got up, got to the
18   car, I slipped him a buck, we got in, I
19   started the engine, the foreman walked
20   up, big guy with dark shades, huge guy,
21   he smiled a big one, "good to see you,
22   man!"
23   I smiled back, "thanks, but it's your party,
24   man!"
25   I pulled out into traffic, "they know you,"
26   said my wife.
27   "sure," I said, "I've been there."

        Bukowski, Charles :  the flashing of the odds [from The Last
        Night of the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   parking lot attendant, Bobby, was funny,
2   wise-cracking, laughing, was
3   good at it, he was an original,
4   sometimes when I was down
5   listening to Bobby brought me back
6   up.


7   didn't see him for 3 weeks, asked the
8   other attendants but they didn't know
9   or made things up.


10   drove in today and there was
11   Bobby, his uniform wrinkled, he was just
12   standing there while the others
13   worked.


14   approached him and he seemed to
15   recognize me, then spoke: "got all
16   stressed out driving here, it took me
17   3 hours!"


18   he wasn't laughing, had grown suddenly
19   fat, his belt buckle was
20   unfastened, I buckled him up, he
21   had a 3 day beard,
22   his
23   hair was grey, his face wrinkled, his
24   eyes stuck in a backwash, 20 years
25   lost in 3 weeks.


26   "good to see you, Bobby."


27   "yeah, sure, when you going to buy
28   this place?"


29   he was talking about the
30   racetrack.

[Page 115 ]




31   I walked across the lot and into
32   the track, took the escalator
33   up, reached the top floor, walked
34   toward the service stand.
35   Betty saw me and got my coffee
36   poured.


37   "you ready for a big day?"
38   she asked.


39   "I'm ready for any kind of
40   day."


41   "you come here to win, don't
42   you?"


43   "I come here not to
44   lose."


45   I took my coffee to a seat
46   facing the toteboard.
47   the odds flashed, I sat down
48   spilling hot coffee
49   on my
50   hand.


51   "shit," I said.


52   and the day went
53   on.

        Bukowski, Charles :  peace [from The Last Night of the Earth
        Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   near the corner table in the
2   cafe
3   a middle-aged couple
4   sit.
5   they have finished their
6   meal
7   and they are each drinking a
8   beer.
9   it is 9 in the evening.
10   she is smoking a
11   cigarette.
12   then he says something.
13   she nods.
14   then she speaks.
15   he grins, moves his
16   hand.
17   then they are
18   quiet.
19   through the blinds next to
20   their table
21   flashing red neon
22   blinks on and
23   off.


24   there is no war.
25   there is no hell.


26   then he raises his beer
27   bottle.
28   it is green.
29   he lifts it to his lips,
30   tilts it.


31   it is a coronet.


32   her right elbow is
33   on the table

[Page 119 ]


34   and in her hand
35   she holds the
36   cigarette
37   between her thumb and
38   forefinger
39   and
40   as she watches
41   him
42   the streets outside
43   flower
44   in the
45   night.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the bluebird [from The Last Night of the
        Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   there's a bluebird in my heart that
2   wants to get out
3   but I'm too tough for him,
4   I say, stay in there, I'm not going
5   to let anybody see
6   you.


7   there's a bluebird in my heart that
8   wants to get out
9   but I pour whiskey on him and inhale
10   cigarette smoke
11   and the whores and the bartenders
12   and the grocery clerks
13   never know that
14   he's
15   in there.


16   there's a bluebird in my heart that
17   wants to get out
18   but I'm too tough for him,
19   I say,
20   stay down, do you want to mess
21   me up?
22   you want to screw up the
23   works?
24   you want to blow my book sales in
25   Europe?


26   there's a bluebird in my heart that
27   wants to get out
28   but I'm too clever, I only let him out
29   at night sometimes
30   when everybody's asleep.
31   I say, I know that you're there,
32   so don't be
33   sad.

[Page 121 ]




34   then I put him back,
35   but he's singing a little
36   in there, I haven't quite let him
37   die
38   and we sleep together like
39   that
40   with our
41   secret pact
42   and it's nice enough to
43   make a man
44   weep, but I don't
45   weep, do
46   you?

        Bukowski, Charles :  going out [from The Last Night of the Earth
        Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   the sweet slide of the luger
2   toward your temple,
3   a flight of birds winging
4   northward,
5   the clicking sound of the
6   safety catch being
7   released,
8   the eclipse of the
9   sun,
10   the sound of something being
11   shut
12   hard,
13   pal.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the replacements [from The Last Night of

1   Jack London drinking his life away while
2   writing of strange and heroic men.
3   Eugene O'Neill drinking himself oblivious
4   while writing his dark and poetic
5   works.


6   now our moderns
7   lecture at universities
8   in tie and suit,
9   the little boys soberly studious,
10   the little girls with glazed eyes
11   looking
12   up,
13   the lawns so green, the books so dull,
14   the life so dying of
15   thirst.


[Page 127 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  the genius [from The Last Night of the
        Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   this man sometimes forgets who
2   he is.
3   sometimes he thinks he's the
4   Pope.


5   other times he thinks he's a
6   hunted rabbit
7   and hides under the
8   bed.


9   then
10   all at once
11   he'll recapture total
12   clarity
13   and begin creating
14   works of
15   art.


16   then he'll be all right
17   for some
18   time.


19   then, say,
20   he'll be sitting with his
21   wife
22   and 3 or 4 other
23   people
24   discussing various
25   matters


26   he will be charming,
27   incisive,
28   original.


29   then he'll do
30   something
31   strange.

[Page 128 ]




32   like once
33   he stood up
34   unzipped
35   and began
36   pissing
37   on the
38   rug.


39   another time
40   he ate a paper
41   napkin.


42   and there was
43   the time
44   he got into his
45   car
46   and drove it
47   backwards
48   all the way to
49   the
50   grocery store
51   and back
52   again
53   backwards
54   the other motorists
55   screaming at
56   him
57   but he
58   made it
59   there and
60   back
61   without
62   incident
63   and without
64   being
65   stopped
66   by a patrol
67   car.

[Page 129 ]




68   but he's best
69   as the
70   Pope
71   and his
72   Latin
73   is very
74   good.


75   his works of
76   art
77   aren't that
78   exceptional
79   but they allow him
80   to
81   survive
82   and to live with
83   a series of
84   19-year-old
85   wives
86   who
87   cut his hair
88   his toenails
89   bib
90   tuck and
91   feed
92   him.


93   he wears everybody
94   out
95   but
96   himself.

        Bukowski, Charles :  a poet in New York [from The Last Night of
        the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   eating out tonight
2   I find a table alone
3   and while waiting for my order
4   take out my wife's copy of
5   /A Poet in New York/ .
6   I often carry things to read
7   so that I will not have to look at
8   the people.


9   I find the poems bad (for me)
10   these poems written in 1929
11   the year of the stock market
12   crash.


13   I close the book and look at
14   the people.


15   my order arrives.
16   the food is bad too.


17   some say that bad and good
18   run in streaks.


19   I hope so.
20   I wait for the good, put a slice of
21   lemon chicken into my
22   mouth, chew
23   and pretend that everything is
24   fairly
25   fine.

        Bukowski, Charles :  no sale [from The Last Night of the Earth
        Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I just sat in the bar
2   /non compos mentis/ .


3   it was about a week before
4   Xmas.
5   big Ed was selling trees
6   outside.


7   he came into the
8   bar.


9   "Jesus, it's freezing out
10   there!"


11   big Ed looked at me.


12   "Hank, you go stand out there
13   with the trees.
14   if anybody wants to buy
15   one, you come in and
16   get me."


17   I stood outside.


18   I was in my shirt sleeves.
19   I didn't have a coat.
20   it was snowing.
21   it was ice cold
22   but a nice ice
23   cold.
24   I wasn't used to snow
25   but I liked the snow.


26   I stood with the trees.


27   I stood there about 20
28   minutes

[Page 132 ]


29   then big Ed came
30   out.


31   "nobody come by?"


32   "no, Ed."


33   "you go on in, tell Billy Boy
34   to give you a drink on
35   my tab."


36   I walked in
37   got a stool.


38   I told Billy Boy,
39   "double scotch and water,
40   Ed's tab."


41   Billy Boy poured.


42   "you sell any trees?"


43   "no trees."


44   Billy Boy looked at
45   the patrons.


46   "hey, Hank didn't sell
47   no trees."


48   "whatsa matter, Hank?"
49   somebody asked.


50   I didn't answer.
51   I took a hit of my
52   drink.


53   "how come no trees were
54   sold?" somebody else
55   asked.

[Page 133 ]




56   "as the bee swarms to
57   honey, as night follows
58   day
59   in the stink of time,
60   it will
61   happen."


62   "what will happen?"


63   "somebody will sell a tree
64   though it won't necessarily
65   be me."


66   I finished my drink.


67   there was
68   silence.


69   then somebody said,
70   "this guy is some kind of
71   nut."


72   being there
73   with those
74   I decided
75   I had no argument
76   with
77   that.

        Bukowski, Charles :  this [from The Last Night of the Earth

1   self-congratulatory nonsense as the
2   famous gather to applaud their seeming
3   greatness


4   you
5   wonder where
6   the real ones are


7   what
8   giant cave
9   hides them


10   as
11   the deathly talentless
12   bow to

29   centuries.

36   shackles hope


37   it
38   makes little things
39   like
40   pulling up a shade
41   or
42   putting on your shoes
43   or
44   walking out on the street


45   more difficult
46   near
47   damnable


48   as
49   the famous gather to
50   applaud their

1   a warrior
2   I come in from a long but
3   victorious day
4   at the track.


5   she greets me with some
6   trash
7   which I carry and dump
8   into the garbage
9   can.


10   "Jesus Christ," she says,
11   "push the lid down tight!
12   the ants will be
13   /everywhere!/ "


14   I push the lid down tight.


15   I think of Amsterdam.
16   I think of pigeons flying from a
17   roof.
18   I think of Time dangling from
19   a
20   paper clip.


21   she's right, of course: the lid
22   should be
23   tight.

1   waiting for death
2   like a cat
3   that will jump on the
4   bed


5   I am so very sorry for
6   my wife


7   she will see this
8   stiff
9   white
10   body


11   shake it once, then
12   maybe
13   again:


14   "Hank!"


15   Hank won't
16   answer.


17   it's not my death that
18   worries me, it's my wife
19   left with this
20   pile of
21   nothing.


22   I want to
23   let her know
24   though
25   that all the nights
26   sleeping
27   beside her


28   even the useless
29   arguments
30   were things

[Page 139 ]


31   ever splendid


32   and the hard
33   words
34   I ever feared to
35   say
36   can now be
37   said:


38   I love
39   you.

        Bukowski, Charles :  mugged [from The Last Night of the Earth
        Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   finished,
2   can't find the handle,
3   mugged in the backalleys of nowhere,
4   too many dark days and nights,
5   too many unkind noons, plus a
6   steady fixation for
7   the ladies of death.


8   I am
9   finished. roll me
10   up, package
11   me,
12   toss me
13   to the birds of Normandy or the
14   gulls of Santa Monica, I
15   no longer
16   read
17   I
18   no longer
19   breed,
20   I
21   talk to old men over quiet
22   fences.


23   is this where my suicide complex
24   un-
25   complexes?: as
26   I am asked over the telephone:
27   did you ever know Kerouac?


28   I now allow cars to pass me on the freeway.
29   I haven't been in a fist fight for 15 years.
30   I have to get up and piss 3 times a night.


31   and when I see a sexpot on the street I
32   only see
33   trouble.

[Page 141 ]




34   I am
35   finished, back to square one,
36   drinking alone and listening to classical
37   music.


38   much about dying is getting ready.
39   the tiger walks through my dreams.


40   the cigarette in my mouth just exploded.


41   curious things still do
42   occur.


43   no, I never knew Kerouac.


44   so you see:
45   my life wasn't
46   useless
47   after
48   all.


[Page 142 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  the writer [from The Last Night of the
        Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   when I think of the things I endured trying to be a
2   writer---all those rooms in all those cities,
3   nibbling on tiny bits of food that wouldn't
4   keep a rat
5   alive.


6   I was so thin I could slice bread with my
7   shoulderblades, only I seldom had
8   bread ...
9   meanwhile, writing things down
10   again and again
11   on pieces of paper.


12   and when I moved from one place to
13   another
14   my cardboard suitcase was just
15   that: paper outside stuffed with
16   paper inside.


17   each new landlady would
18   ask, "what do you
19   do?"


20   "I'm a writer."


21   "oh ..."


22   as I settled into tiny rooms to evoke my
23   craft
24   many of them pitied me, gave me little
25   tidbits like apples, walnuts,
26   peaches ...
27   little did they know
28   that that
29   was about all that I
30   ate.

[Page 143 ]




31   but their pity ended when
32   they found cheap wine bottles in my
33   place.


34   it's all right to be a starving writer
35   but not
36   a starving writer who
37   drinks.
38   drunks are never forgiven
39   anything.


40   but when the world is closing in very
41   fast
42   a bottle of wine seems a very
43   reasonable friend.


44   ah. all those landladies,
45   most of them heavy, slow, their husbands
46   long dead, I can still see those
47   dears
48   climbing up and down the stairways of
49   their world.


50   they ruled my very existence:
51   without them allowing me
52   an extra week on the rent
53   now and then,
54   I was out on the
55   street


56   and I couldn't WRITE
57   on the street.
58   it was very important to have a
59   room, a door, those
60   walls.


61   oh, those dark mornings
62   in those beds
63   listening to their footsteps
64   listening to them cough

[Page 144 ]


65   hearing the flushing of their
66   toilets, smelling the cooking of
67   their food
68   while waiting
69   for some word
70   on my submissions to New York City
71   and the world,
72   my submissions to those educated,
73   intelligent, snobbish, inbred,
74   formal, comfortable people
75   out there


76   they truly took their time to
77   say, no.


78   yes, in those dark beds
79   with the landladies rustling about
80   puttering and snooping, sharpening
81   utensils,
82   I often thought of those editors and
83   publishers out there
84   who didn't recognize
85   what I was trying to say
86   in my special
87   way


88   and I thought, they must be
89   wrong.


90   then this would be followed
91   with a thought much worse
92   than that:


93   I could be a
94   fool:


95   almost every writer thinks
96   they are doing
97   exceptional work.

[Page 145 ]




98   that's
99   normal.


100   being a fool is
101   normal.


102   and then I'd
103   get out of bed
104   find a piece of
105   paper
106   and start
107   writing
108   again.


[Page 146 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  they don't eat like us [from The Last Night
        of the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   my father eating.


2   his ears moved.


3   he munched with great vigor.


4   I wished him in hell.


5   I watched the fork in his hand.
6   I watched it put food into his mouth.


7   the food I ate was tasteless and deadly.
8   his small bits of conversation entered my head.
9   the words ran down my spine.
10   they spilled into my shoes.


11   "eat your food, Henry," my mother said.


12   he said, "many people are starving and don't eat as well as us!"


13   I wished him in hell.
14   I watched his fork.
15   it gathered more food and put it into his mouth.
16   he chewed in a dog-like fashion.
17   his ears moved.


18   the brutal beatings he gave me I was ready for.
19   but watching him eat brought on the darkness.
20   there at the tablecloth.
21   there with the green and blue wooden napkin holders.


22   "eat your food or I'll strop your god damned ass," he told me.


23   later in life I made him pay somewhat.
24   but he still owes me.


25   and I'll never collect.


[Page 147 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  let me tell you [from The Last Night of the
        Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   hell is built
2   piece by piece
3   brick by brick
4   around
5   you.
6   it's a gradual,
7   not a rapid
8   process.


9   we build our
10   own
11   inferno,
12   blame
13   others.


14   but hell is
15   hell.


16   wordly hell is
17   hell.


18   my hell and
19   your
20   hell.


21   our
22   hell.


23   hell, hell,
24   hell.


25   the song of
26   hell.


27   putting your
28   shoes on
29   in the
30   morning.
31   hell.


[Page 148 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  blasted apart with the first breath [from
        The Last Night of the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   running out of days
2   as the banister glints
3   in the early morning sun.


4   there will be no rest
5   even in our dreams.


6   now, all there is to do is
7   reset
8   broken moments.


9   when even to exist seems a
10   victory
11   then surely our luck has
12   run thin


13   thinner than a bloody stream
14   toward death.


15   life is a sad song:
16   we have heard too many
17   voices
18   seen too many
19   faces
20   too many
21   bodies


22   worst have been the faces:
23   a dirty joke that no one
24   can understand.


25   barbaric, senseless days total
26   in your skull;
27   reality is a juiceless
28   orange.

[Page 149 ]




29   there is no plan
30   no out
31   no divinity
32   no sparrow of
33   joy.


34   we can't compare life to
35   anything---that's
36   too dreary a
37   prospect.


38   relatively speaking,
39   we were never short on
40   courage


41   but, at best, the odds
42   remained long
43   and
44   at worst,
45   unchangeable.


46   and what was worst:
47   not that we wasted
48   it
49   but that it was
50   wasted
51   on us:


52   coming out of
53   the Womb
54   trapped
55   in light and
56   darkness


57   stricken and numbed


58   alone in the temperate zone of
59   dumb agony

60   now


61   running out of days
62   as the banister glints

        Bukowski, Charles :  Elvis lives [from The Last Night of the
        Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the boy was going to take the bus out
2   to see the
3   Graceland Mansion


4   then
5   the Greyhound Lines went
6   on strike.


7   there were only two clerks
8   and two lines
9   at the station
10   and the lines were
11   50 to 65 people
12   long.


13   after two hours in line
14   one of the clerks told the
15   boy
16   that his bus
17   would leave
18   as soon as the substitute
19   driver arrived.


20   "when will that be?" the
21   boy asked.


22   "we can't
23   be certain," the
24   clerk answered.


25   the boy slept on the floor
26   that night
27   but by 9 a.m.
28   the next morning
29   the substitute driver
30   still had not
31   arrived.

[Page 152 ]




32   the boy had to wait
33   in another line
34   to get to the
35   toilet.


36   he finally got a
37   stall, carefully
38   fitted the
39   sanitary toilet seat
40   paper cover,
41   pulled down his
42   pants,
43   his shorts
44   and
45   sat down.


46   luckily
47   the boy had a
48   pencil.


49   he found a clean
50   space
51   among all the
52   smeared and demented
53   scrawlings and
54   drawings


55   and very
56   carefully
57   and
58   heavily
59   he printed:


60   HEARTBREAK HOTEL


61   then he dropped the
62   first
63   one.

        Bukowski, Charles :  my buddy in valet parking at the racetrack:
        [from The Last Night of the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow
        Press ]



1   after 9 long races among greedy faces
2   on a hot Sunday that hardly rhymes with
3   reason
4   I have murdered another day,
5   come out with shoelaces flopping (while
6   secretly craving to be in a moss-
7   lined cave, say,
8   watching black and white cartoons
9   while wanton simplicity soothes the
10   muddled brain)
11   as my buddy the valet races the
12   machine up, revving the 8-year-
13   old engine, he leaps
14   out:
15   "how ya doin', baby?"
16   "things have me by the jugular, Frank,
17   I'm ready to run up the white
18   flag."
19   "not /you/ , baby, you're my
20   /leader!/ "
21   "you can do better than that,
22   Frank ..."


23   I get in, hook the seat belt, put on
24   the driving glasses, put it in first ...


25   "hey, man," he sticks his head into the
26   window, "let's go out and get drunk and
27   kick some ass and find some
28   pussy!"


29   I tell him, "I'll consider that."


30   as I pull out I can see him in the rear-

[Page 154 ]


31   view mirror: he's giving me the
32   finger.


33   I smile for the first time in 7 or
34   8 hours.

        Bukowski, Charles :  spark [from The Last Night of the Earth
        Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I always resented all the years, the hours, the
2   minutes I gave them as a working stiff, it
3   actually hurt my head, my insides, it made me
4   dizzy and a bit crazy---I couldn't understand the
5   murdering of my years
6   yet my fellow workers gave no signs of
7   agony, many of them even seemed satisfied, and
8   seeing them that way drove me almost as crazy as
9   the dull and senseless work.


10   the workers submitted.
11   the work pounded them to nothingness, they were
12   scooped-out and thrown away.


13   I resented each minute, every minute as it was
14   mutilated
15   and nothing relieved the monotony.


16   I considered suicide.
17   I drank away my few leisure hours.


18   I worked for decades.


19   I lived with the worst kind of women, they killed what
20   the job failed to kill.


21   I knew that I was dying.
22   something in me said, go ahead, die, sleep, become as
23   them, accept.


24   then something else in me said, no, save the tiniest
25   bit.
26   it needn't be much, just a spark.
27   a spark can set a whole forest on
28   fire.
29   just a spark.
30   save it.

[Page 159 ]




31   I think I did.
32   I'm glad I did.
33   what a lucky god damned
34   thing.


[Page 160 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  the science of physiognomy [from The Last
        Night of the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   long gone along the way, faces
2   grey and white and black and brown, and
3   eyes, all color of eyes.
4   eyes are odd, I have lived with a woman,
5   at least one, where the sex was fair, the
6   conversation passable and sometimes there was
7   even a seeming love
8   but then I suddenly noticed the eyes, saw there
9   the dark smeared walls of a stinking
10   hell.


11   (of course, I am pleased that I do not often have to
12   see my own eyes, lips, hair, ears, so
13   forth---
14   I avoid the mirror with a studied
15   regularity.)


16   long gone along the way, he had a face like a
17   mole pie, fat and unshivering and he walked up to
18   me in the railroad yards, I was beastly sick
19   and that flesh plate shook my innards, my psycho-
20   kid insides as he said, "I'm waiting on my pay-
21   check, I been squeezing this nickel so hard that the
22   buffalo is screaming." he showed me the
23   nickel.
24   tough, but no beer, I walked away from him,
25   my face white like a bright headlight, I walked
26   away from him and toward the faces of the non-
27   whites who
28   hated me with a natural
29   ease.


30   long gone along the way, the landladies' faces,
31   doomed, powdered, old lilac faces, old lovely dolls
32   with husbands so long gone, the agony diminished but
33   still there as I followed them up stairways nearly a
34   century old to some cubicle of a room and I always

[Page 161 ]


35   told them, "ah, a very nice room ..."; to pay
36   then, close the door, undress, lay upon that
37   bed and turn out the light (it was always early
38   evening) and then soon to hear the same sound:
39   the scurry of my old friends: either the roaches or
40   the mice or the rats.


41   long gone along the way, now I wonder about Inez
42   and Irene and their sky-blue eyes and their wonderful
43   legs and breasts
44   but mostly
45   their faces, faces carved out of a marble that
46   sometimes the gods
47   bestow and
48   Inez and Irene sat in front of me in class and learned about
49   algebra, the shortest distance between two points, the
50   Treaty of Versailles, about Attila the Hun and
51   etc.
52   and I watched them and /wondered/ what they were
53   thinking?
54   nothing much,
55   probably.
56   and I wonder where they are tonight
57   with their faces these 5 decades and 2 years
58   later?
59   the skin which covers the bone, the eyes that
60   smile; quick, turn out the light, let the dark
61   dance ...


62   the most beautiful face I ever saw was that of a
63   paperman, a newsboy, the old fellow so long gone
64   down the way
65   who sat at a stand at Beverly and Vermont,
66   his head, his face looked like what they
67   called him: The Frog Man. I saw him
68   often but we seldom spoke and
69   The Frog Man died suddenly
70   and was gone
71   but I will always remember him
72   and one night

[Page 162 ]


73   I came out of a nearby bar,
74   he was there at his stand and
75   he looked at me and said, "you and I, we know the same
76   things."


77   I nodded, put both thumbs up, and that big Frog
78   face, the big Frog head lifted in the moonlight
79   and began laughing the most terrible and real
80   laughter I have ever
81   heard.


82   long gone along the way

43   the dogs of hell pray for me as the
44   world washes to the
45   shore.

        Bukowski, Charles :  wandering in the cage [from The Last Night
        of the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   languid conjecture during hours of moil, trapped in the shadows
2   of the father.
3   sidewalks outside of cafes are lonely
4   through the day.


5   my cat looks at me and is not sure what I am and
6   I look back and am pleased to feel
7   the same
8   about him ...


9   reading 2 issues of a famous magazine of 40 years
10   ago, the writing that I felt was bad then,
11   I still feel
12   is
13   that way


14   and none of the writers have lasted.


15   sometimes there is a strange justice
16   working
17   somewhere.


18   sometimes
19   not ...


20   grammar school was the first awakening of a long hell
21   to come:
22   meeting other beings as horrible as my
23   parents.


24   something I never thought
25   possible ...


26   when I won the medal for Manual of Arms in the
27   R.O.T.C.
28   I wasn't interested in
29   winning.

[Page 167 ]




30   I wasn't much interested in anything, even the
31   girls seemed a bad game
32   to chase: all too much for all too
33   little


34   at night before sleeping I often considered what I
35   would do, what I would be:
36   bank robber, drunk, beggar, idiot, common
37   laborer.


38   I settled on idiot and common laborer, it
39   seemed more comfortable than any of the
40   alternatives ...


41   the best thing about near-starvation and hunger is
42   that when you finally
43   eat
44   it is such a beautiful and delicious and
45   magical thing.


46   people who eat 3 meals a day throughout life
47   have never really
48   /tasted/
49   food ...


50   people are strange: they are constantly angered by
51   trivial things,
52   but on a major matter
53   like
54   totally wasting their lives,
55   they hardly seem to
56   notice ...


57   on writers: I found out that most of them
58   swam together.
59   there were schools, establishments,
60   theories.
61   groups gathered and fought each
62   other.
63   there was literary politics.

[Page 168 ]




64   there was game-playing and
65   bitterness.


66   I always thought writing was a
67   solitary profession.


68   still do ...


69   animals never worry about
70   Heaven or Hell.


71   neither do
72   I.


73   maybe that's why
74   we
75   get along ...


76   when lonely people come around
77   I soon can understand why
78   other people leave them
79   alone.


80   and that which would be a
81   blessing to
82   me


83   is a horror to
84   them ...


85   poor poor Celine.
86   he only wrote one book.
87   forget the others.
88   but what a book it was:
89   /Voyage au bout de la nuit/ .
90   it took everything out of
91   him.
92   it left him a hopscotch
93   odd-ball
94   skittering through the

[Page 169 ]


95   fog of
96   eventuality ...


97   the United States is a very strange
98   place: it reached its apex in
99   1970
100   and since then
101   for every year
102   it has regressed
103   3 years,
104   until now
105   in 1989
106   it is 1930
107   in the way of
108   doing things.


109   you don't have to go to the movies
110   to see a horror
111   show.


112   there is a madhouse near the post office
113   where I mail my works
114   out.


115   I never park in front of the post office,
116   I park in front of the madhouse
117   and walk down.


118   I walk past the madhouse.


119   some of the lesser mad are allowed
120   out on the porch.
121   they sit like
122   pigeons.


123   I feel a brotherhood with
124   them.
125   but I don't sit with them.

[Page 170 ]




126   I walk down and drop my works
127   in the first class slot.


128   I am supposed to know what I am
129   doing.


130   I walk back, look at them and
131   don't look at
132   them.


133   I get in my car and drive
134   off.


135   I am allowed to drive a
136   car.


137   I drive it all the way back to my
138   house.


139   I drive my car up the driveway,
140   thinking,
141   what am I doing?


142   I get out of my car
143   and one of my 5 cats walks up to
144   me, he is a very fine
145   fellow.


146   I reach down and touch
147   him.


148   then I feel all right.


149   I am exactly what I am supposed to
150   be.

1   the dogs are at it again; they leap and
2   tear, back off, circle, then
3   attack again.


4   and I had thought this was over, I had
5   thought that they had
6   forgotten; now there are only
7   more of them.


8   and I am older,
9   now


10   but the dogs are
11   ageless


12   and as always they tear not only at
13   the flesh but also at
14   the mind and the spirit.


15   now
16   they are circling me
17   in this room.


18   they are not
19   beautiful; they are the dogs
20   from hell


21   and they will find you
22   too


23   even though you are one
24   of them
25   now.

        Bukowski, Charles :  question and answer [from The Last Night of
        the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   he sat naked and drunk in a room of summer
2   night, running the blade of the knife
3   under his fingernails, smiling, thinking
4   of all the letters he had received
5   telling him that
6   the way he lived and wrote about
7   that---
8   it had kept them going when
9   all seemed
10   truly
11   hopeless.


12   putting the blade on the table, he
13   flicked it with a finger
14   and it whirled
15   in a flashing circle
16   under the light.


17   who the hell is going to save
18   me? he
19   thought.


20   as the knife stopped spinning
21   the answer came:
22   you're going to have to
23   save yourself.


24   still smiling,
25   a: he lit a
26   cigarette
27   b: he poured
28   another
29   drink
30   c: gave the blade
31   another
32   spin.

        Bukowski, Charles :  fan letter [from The Last Night of the
        Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I been readin' you for a long time now,
2   I just put Billy Boy to bed,
3   he got 7 mean ticks from somewhere,
4   I got 2,
5   my husband, Benny, he got 3.
6   some of us love bugs, others hate
7   them.
8   Benny writes poems.
9   he was in the same magazine as you
10   once.
11   Benny is the world's greatest writer
12   but he got this temper.
13   he gave a readin' once and somebody
14   laughed at one of his serious poems
15   and Benny took his thing out right
16   there
17   and pissed on stage.
18   he says you write good but that you
19   couldn't carry his balls in a paper
20   bag.
21   anyhow, I made a BIG POT OF MARMALADE
22   tonight,
23   we all just LOVE marmalade here.
24   Benny lost his job yesterday, he told his
25   boss to stick it up his ass
26   but I still got my job down at the
27   manicure shop.
28   you know fags come in to get their nails
29   done?
30   you aren't a fag, are you, Mr.
31   Chinaski?
32   anyhow, I just felt like writing you.
33   your books are read and read around
34   here.
35   Benny says you're an old fart, you
36   write pretty good but that you
37   couldn't carry his balls in a

[Page 174 ]


38   paper sack.
39   do you like bugs, Mr. Chinaski?
40   I think the marmalade is cool enough to
41   eat now.
42   so goodbye.

        Night of the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   it would be good to get
2   out of here,
3   just go,
4   pop off, get away from
5   memories of this
6   and all
7   that,
8   but staying has its
9   flavor too:
10   all those babes who
11   thought they were
12   hot numbers
13   now living in dirty
14   flats
15   while looking forward
16   to the next
17   episode on
18   some Soap Opera,
19   and all those guys,
20   those who really
21   thought
22   they were going to
23   make it,
24   grinning in the
25   Year Book with their
26   tight-skinned
27   mugs,
28   now they are
29   cops,
30   clerk typists,
31   operators of
32   sandwich stands,
33   horse grooms,
34   plops
35   in the dust.

[Page 176 ]


36   it's good to stay
37   around
38   to see what
39   happened to
40   all the
41   others---only
42   when you go to
43   the bathroom,
44   avoid the
45   mirror
46   and
47   don't look
48   at
49   what you
50   flush
51   away.

        Bukowski, Charles :  finished [from The Last Night of the Earth
        Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the ball comes up to the
2   plate and I can't
3   see
4   it.


5   my batting average has dropped to
6   .231


7   small things constantly
8   irritate me
9   and I can't sleep
10   nights.


11   "you'll come back,
12   Harry," my teammates
13   tell me.


14   then they grin and are
15   secretly
16   pleased.


17   I've been benched for a
18   22 year old
19   kid.


20   he looks good up there:
21   power, lots of line
22   drives.


23   "ever thought of coaching?"
24   the manager asks.


25   "no," I tell him, "how about
26   you?"


27   when I get home my wife
28   asks, "you get in the line-
29   up tonight?"

[Page 178 ]


30   "nope."


31   "don't worry, he'll put you
32   in."


33   "no, he won't. I'm gonna
34   pinch hit the rest of the
35   season."


36   I go into the bathroom and
37   look into the
38   mirror.


39   I'm no 22 year old
40   kid.


41   what gets me is that it
42   seemed to happen
43   overnight.


44   one night I was good.
45   the next night, it
46   seemed, I was
47   finished.


48   I come out of the bathroom
49   and my wife says,
50   "don't worry, all you need
51   is a little
52   rest."


53   "I been thinking about going
54   into coaching," I tell
55   her.


56   "sure," she says, "and after
57   that I'll bet you'll be a
58   good manager."


59   "hell yes," I say, "anything
60   on tv?"


[Page 179 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  zero [from The Last Night of the Earth
        Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   dark taste in mouth, my neck is stiff, I am looking for
2   my sonic vibrator, the music on my radio is diseased,
3   the winds of death seep through my slippers, and a
4   terrible letter in the mail today from a pale non-
5   soul
6   who requests that he may come by to see me
7   in repayment, he says, for a ride he gave me home
8   from a drunken Pasadena party
9   20 years ago.
10   also, one of the cats shit on the rug this
11   morning
12   and in the first race I bet this afternoon
13   the horse tossed the jock
14   coming out of the gate.


15   downstairs
16   I have a large photo of Hemingway
17   drunk before noon in Havana, he's on the floor
18   mouth open, his big belly trying to flop
19   out of his shirt.


20   I feel like that photo and I'm not even drunk.
21   maybe
22   that's the problem.


23   whatever the problem is, it's there, and worse, it
24   shouldn't be
25   for I have been a lucky man, I shouldn't even
26   be here
27   after all I have done to myself
28   and after all they have done
29   to me
30   I ought to be kneeling to the gods and giving
31   thanks.
32   instead, I deride their kindness by being
33   impatient
34   with the world.

[Page 180 ]


35   maybe a damned good night's sleep will bring me back
36   to a gentle sanity.
37   but at the moment, I look about this room and, like
38   myself, it's all in disarray: things fallen
39   out of place, cluttered, jumbled, lost, knocked
40   over, and I can't put it straight, don't
41   want to.


42   perhaps living through these petty days will get us ready
43   for the dangerous ones.

        Bukowski, Charles :  eyeless through space [from The Last Night

1   it's no longer any good, sucker, they've
2   turned out the lights, they've
3   blocked the rear entrance
4   and
5   the front's on fire;
6   nobody knows your name;
7   down at the opera they play
8   checkers;
9   the city fountains piss
10   blood;
11   the extremities are reamed
12   and
13   they've hung the best
14   barber;
15   the dim souls have ascended;
16   the cardboard souls smile;
17   the love of dung is unanimous;
18   it's no longer any good, sucker, the
19   graves have emptied out onto the
20   living;
21   last is first,
22   lost is everything;
23   the giant dogs mourn through dandelion
24   dreams;
25   the panthers welcome cages;
26   the onion heart is frosted,
27   destiny is destitute,
28   the horns of reason are muted as
29   the laughter of fools blockades the air;
30   the champions are dead
31   and
32   the newly born are smitten;
33   the jetliners vomit the eyeless through
34   space;
35   it's no longer any good, sucker, it's been
36   getting to that
37   right along

[Page 182 ]


38   and now
39   it's here
40   and you can't touch it smell it see it
41   because it's nothing everywhere as
42   you look up or down or turn or sit or stand
43   or sleep or run,
44   it's no longer any good, sucker.
45   it's no longer any good
46   sucker sucker sucker
47   and
48   if you don't already know
49   I'm not surprised
50   and
51   if you do, sucker, good
52   luck
53   in the dark
54   going nowhere.

1   not much chance in

3   cheese dislikes the

5   the center fielder
6   turns
7   runs back
8   in his stupid

27   side by side
28   in urinals,
29   trained in the

45   opens a window
46   looks at a

49   water;

52   or
53   in the look
54   of the eye
55   of
56   the man
57   who sits in a

1   fine then, thunderclaps at midnight, death in the
2   plaza.
3   my shoes need shining.
4   my typewriter is silent.


5   I write this in pen
6   in an old yellow
7   notebook
8   while
9   leaning propped up against the wall
10   behind the
11   bed.


12   Hemingway said, "it won't come
13   anymore."
14   later---the gun
15   into the
16   mouth.


17   not writing is not good
18   but trying to write
19   when you can't is
20   worse.


21   hey, I have excuses:
22   I have TB and the
23   antibiotics dull the
24   brain.


25   "you'll write again," people
26   assure me, "you'll be
27   better than
28   ever."


29   that's nice to know.

[Page 186 ]


30   but the typewriter is silent
31   and it looks at
32   me.


33   meanwhile, every two or three
34   weeks
35   I get a fan letter in the mail
36   telling me that
37   surely
38   I must be
39   the world's greatest
40   writer.


41   but
42   the typewriter is silent
43   and looks at
44   me....


45   this is one of the
46   strangest times
47   of my
48   life.


49   I've got to do a
50   Lazarus
51   and I can't even
52   shine
53   my shoes.

        Bukowski, Charles :  Downtown Billy [from The Last Night of the
        Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   they used to call him
2   "Downtown" Billy.


3   "Downtown" had these
4   long arms
5   and he swung them
6   with
7   abandon
8   and with great
9   force.


10   when you fought
11   "Downtown" Billy
12   you never knew
13   where the punches
14   were coming
15   from: "They come
16   from Downtown ..."


17   "Downtown" once rose
18   all the way
19   to #4 in his weight
20   class,
21   then he dropped out
22   of the first
23   ten.


24   then he fell to
25   fighting 6 rounders,
26   then 4.


27   the punches still
28   came from
29   Downtown
30   but you could
31   see them
32   coming.

[Page 188 ]


33   then he was just a
34   sparring
35   partner.


36   last I heard
37   he left
38   town.


39   today I feel
40   like "Downtown" Billy,
41   sitting in this
42   blue garden chair
43   under the
44   walnut
45   tree,
46   watching the
47   neighbor boy
48   bounce a
49   basketball,
50   take some
51   fancy steps
52   forward,
53   then loop the
54   ball
55   through the
56   hoop
57   over the
58   garage
59   door.


60   I have just taken
61   my
62   pills.

        Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   from my bed
2   I watch
3   3 birds
4   on a telephone
5   wire.


6   one flies
7   off.
8   then
9   another.


10   one is left,
11   then
12   it too
13   is gone.


14   my typewriter is
15   tombstone
16   still.


17   and I am
18   reduced to bird
19   watching.


20   just thought I'd
21   let you
22   know,
23   fucker.

        Bukowski, Charles :  ill [from The Last Night of the Earth Poems
        (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   being very ill and very weak is a very strange
2   thing.
3   when it takes all your strength to get from the
4   bedroom to the bathroom and back, it seems like
5   a joke but
6   you don't laugh.


7   back in bed you consider death again and find
8   the same thing: the closer you get to it
9   the less forbidding it
10   becomes.


11   you have much time to examine the walls
12   and outside
13   birds on a telephone wire take on much
14   importance.
15   and there's the tv: men playing baseball
16   day after day.


17   no appetite.
18   food tastes like cardboard, it makes you
19   ill, more than
20   ill.


21   the good wife keeps insisting that you
22   eat.
23   "the doctor said ..."


24   poor dear.


25   and the cats.
26   the cats jump up on the bed and look at me.
27   they stare, then jump
28   off.


29   what a world, you think: eat, work, fuck,
30   die.

[Page 191 ]




31   luckily I have a contagious disease: no
32   visitors.


33   the scale reads 155, down from
34   217.


35   I look like a man in a death camp.
36   I
37   am.


38   still, I'm lucky: I feast on solitude, I
39   will never miss the crowd.


40   I could read the great books but the great books don't
41   interest me.


42   I sit in bed and wait for the whole thing to go
43   one way or the
44   other.


45   just like everybody
46   else.

        Bukowski, Charles :  only one Cervantes [from The Last Night of
        the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   it's no use, I've got to admit,
2   I am into my first real
3   writer's block
4   after over
5   5 decades
6   of typing.
7   I have some excuses:
8   I've had a long
9   illness
10   and I'm nearing the age of
11   70.
12   and when you're near
13   70 you always consider the
14   possibility of
15   slippage.
16   but I am bucked-up
17   by the fact that
18   Cervantes
19   wrote his greatest work
20   at the age of
21   80.
22   but how many
23   Cervantes
24   are there?


25   I've been spoiled with the
26   easy way I have created
27   things,
28   and now there's this
29   miserable
30   stoppage.


31   and now
32   spiritually constipated I've
33   grown testy,
34   have screamed at my wife
35   twice this week,

[Page 193 ]


36   once smashing a glass
37   into the sink.
38   bad form,
39   sick nerves,
40   bad
41   style.


42   I should accept this
43   writer's block.
44   hell, I'm lucky I'm alive,
45   I'm lucky I don't have
46   cancer.
47   I'm lucky in a hundred
48   different ways.
49   sometimes at night
50   in bed
51   at one or two a.m.
52   I will think about
53   how lucky I am
54   and it keeps me
55   awake.


56   now I've always written in a
57   selfish way, that is, to please
58   myself.
59   by writing things down I have
60   been better able to
61   live with them.


62   now, that's
63   stopped.


64   I see other old men with canes
65   sitting at bus stop benches,
66   staring straight into the sun and
67   seeing nothing.
68   and I know there are other
69   old men
70   in hospitals and nursing
71   homes

[Page 194 ]


72   sitting upright in their
73   beds
74   grunting over
75   bedpans.
76   death is nothing, brother,
77   it's life that's
78   hard.


79   writing has been my fountain
80   of youth,
81   my whore,
82   my love,
83   my gamble.


84   the gods have spoiled me.


85   yet look, I am still
86   lucky,
87   for writing about a
88   writer's block
89   is better than not writing
90   at all.

        Bukowski, Charles :  that I have known the dead [from The Last
        Night of the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   that I have known the dead and now I'm
2   dying
3   as they spoon succotash and
4   noodles
5   into a skull
6   past
7   caring.


8   that I have known the dead and now I'm
9   dying
10   in a world long ago
11   gone


12   leaving this is
13   nothing.
14   loving it was
15   too.


16   that I have known the dead and now I'm
17   dying
18   fingers thin to the
19   bone,
20   I offer no
21   prayers.


22   that I have known the dead and now I'm
23   dying


24   dying
25   I have known the dead


26   here on earth
27   and elsewhere;
28   alone now,
29   alone then,
30   alone.

        Bukowski, Charles :  are you drinking? [from The Last Night of
        the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   washed-up, on shore, the old yellow notebook
2   out again
3   I write from the bed
4   as I did last
5   year.


6   will see the doctor,
7   Monday.


8   "yes, doctor, weak legs, vertigo, head-
9   aches and my back
10   hurts."


11   "are you drinking?" he will ask.
12   "are you getting your
13   exercise, your
14   vitamins?"


15   I think that I am just ill
16   with life, the same stale yet
17   fluctuating
18   factors.


19   even at the track
20   I watch the horses run by
21   and it seems
22   meaningless.


23   I leave early after buying tickets on the
24   remaining races.


25   "taking off?" asks the mutuel
26   clerk.


27   "yes, it's boring,"
28   I tell him.

[Page 197 ]




29   "if you think it's boring
30   out there," he tells me, "you oughta be
31   back here."


32   so here I am
33   propped against my pillows
34   again


35   just an old guy
36   just an old writer
37   with a yellow
38   notebook.


39   something is
40   walking across the
41   floor
42   toward
43   me.


44   oh, it's just
45   my cat


46   this
47   time.


[Page 198 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  "D" [from The Last Night of the Earth Poems
        (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the doctor is into collecting art
2   and the magazines in his waiting room
3   are Artsy
4   have thick covers, glistening pages,
5   and large color
6   photos.


7   the receptionist calls my name and
8   I'm led into a waiting room with
9   walls adorned with paintings
10   and a chart of the human
11   body.


12   the doctor enters: "how are you
13   doing?"


14   not well, I think, or I wouldn't
15   be here.


16   "now," he goes on, "I am surprised
17   by the biopsy, I didn't expect
18   this ..."


19   the doctor is a bald, well-scrubbed
20   pink fellow.


21   "I can almost always tell just by
22   looking; this time, I
23   missed ..."


24   he paused.


25   "go on," I say.


26   "all right, let's say there are
27   4 types of cancer---A, B, C, D.

[Page 199 ]




28   well, you've got
29   D.
30   and if I had cancer I'd rather
31   have your kind:
32   D."


33   the doctor is in a tough business
34   but the pay is
35   good.


36   "well," he says, "we'll just burn it off,
37   o.k.?"


38   I stretch out on the table and he has an
39   instrument, I can feel the heat of it
40   searing through the air
41   but also
42   I hear a whirring sound
43   like a drill.


44   "it'll be over in a
45   blink ..."


46   the small growth is just inside of
47   the right nostril.
48   the instrument touches it
49   and
50   the room is filled with the smell
51   of burning flesh.


52   then he stops.


53   then he starts
54   again.


55   there is pain but it's sharp and
56   centered.


57   he stops
58   again.

[Page 200 ]




59   "now we are going to do it
60   once more to
61   clean it
62   up."


63   he applies the instrument
64   again.
65   this time I feel the most
66   pain.


67   "there now ..."


68   it's finished, no bandage needed,
69   it's
70   cauterized.


71   then I'm at the receptionist's
72   desk, she makes out a bill, I
73   pay with my
74   Mastercard, am out the door,
75   down the stairway and there
76   in the parking lot
77   awaits
78   my faithful automobile.


79   It's a day with a great deal of
80   afternoon left


81   I light a cigarette, start the
82   car and
83   get the hell
84   out of there
85   moving toward something
86   else.

57   Cleopatra fat and insane
58   Beethoven in the grave.


59   in the bottom of the hour
60   lurks
61   the damnation of Faust and sexual intercourse
62   the sad-eyed dogs of summer lost in the streets
63   the last funeral
64   Celine failing again
65   the carnation in the buttonhole of the kindly killer.

66   in the bottom of the hour

68   fantasies tainted with milk
69   our obnoxious invasion of the planets
70   Chatterton drinking rat poison
71   the bull that should have killed Hemingway
72   Paris like a pimple in the sky.


73   in the bottom of the hour
74   lurks
75   the mad writer in a cork room
76   the falseness of the Senior Prom
77   the submarine with purple footprints.


78   in the bottom of the hour
79   lurks
80   the tree that cries in the night
81   the place that nobody found
82   being so young you thought you could change it
83   being middle-aged and thinking you could survive it
84   being old and thinking you could hide from it.


85   in the bottom of the hour
86   lurks
87   2:30 a.m.
88   and the next to last line
89   and then the last.

2   as the cat leaps wild-eyed
3   as the old bartender leans on the wood
4   as the hummingbird sleeps

6   as the tanks practice on false battlefields
7   as your tires work the freeway
8   as the midget drunk on cheap bourbon cries alone at night
9   as the bulls are carefully bred for the matadors
10   as the grass watches you and the trees watch you
11   as the sea holds creatures vast and true


12   you know and I know and thee know


13   the sadness and the glory of two slippers under a bed
14   the ballet of your heart dancing with your blood
15   young girls of love who will someday hate their mirrors
16   overtime in hell
17   lunch with sick salad


18   you know and I know and thee know


19   the end as we know it now
20   it seems such a lousy trick after the lousy agony but

1   I can't have it

3   and we won't
4   get it


5   so don't bet on it
6   or even think about

10   wash
11   shave
12   clothe

14   and go out into
15   it


16   because
17   outside of that

19   suicide and

21   so you just
22   can't

37   that the tires
38   aren't
39   flat


40   then you get
41   in
42   and if it
43   starts---you
44   start.


45   and
46   it's the damndest

62   one

        Bukowski, Charles :  darkness & ice [from The Last Night of the
        Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I am spooked by the bluebells and the silent harp while
2   passing down Western Avenue and seeing the tombstones
3   placed flat instead of upright upon the cemetery lawn: our decent
4   modernity not wanting to upset us with Finalities while we
5   pay 22% interest on our credit cards.


6   I follow the street on down
7   feeling wonderful that I do not appear to be lost.
8   we need our landmarks (like cemeteries), we need our
9   liquor and our liabilities.
10   we need so many things we think we do not
11   need.


12   strangely then, as I drive south, I begin thinking about
13   THE WORLD IS SQUARE, INC., an institution which meets and
14   discusses the fact that: the world is square and the North Pole is at
15   the CENTER of the SQUARE and holds everything from sliding
16   over the edge and that the EDGE is really a WALL OF
17   DARKNESS AND ICE and that nothing or nobody can go /through/
18   and that
19   when we THINK we are circling the globe we are only
20   CIRCLING the SQUARE, finally arriving back
21   where we began.


22   I wait at a signal, the light turns green and I move on
23   thinking, well, maybe the planets we believe are round are
24   illusions, and the moon and the sun, they are really square
25   too.


26   well, you can't rule anything out; I vote for round
27   but I still realize that it wasn't too long ago when
28   EVERYBODY thought the answer was SQUARE.


29   I stop at another signal, wait, while being held from falling
30   over the EDGE OF DARKNESS AND ICE by the North Pole
31   standing in the
32   CENTER of the SQUARE.

[Page 216 ]




33   the light changes, I drive on, turn left, go a few blocks, turn
34   right, go a block or so, turn left, go a block, turn right, then
35   a left and I am at my driveway, turn in, drive slowly up to
36   the garage
37   past the tangerine tree and the tangerines are round but
38   the garage door is square and I am still spooked by the
39   bluebells and the silent harp
40   cut the engine
41   get out
42   stand up
43   still alive.


44   I move along the walk.
45   god, things are getting interesting again: they say there are
46   bottomless craters at the North Pole and deep in the earth live
47   Creatures from Outer Space
48   down there
49   in a marvelous, beautiful and peaceful Kingdom, I move toward the
50   door, make ready to open it, not at all sure of what will be
51   waiting on the other side---there is always this gnarling
52   apprehension
53   generally but not always warranted, and as the North Pole holds me
54   from falling off either the Curve or the
55   Edge
56   I push open the wooden wall and enter, ready and not ready
57   enough.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the big ride [from The Last Night of the
        Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   all right,
2   some day you'll see me in a plastic
3   helmet, long stockings,
4   double-lens goggles;
5   I'll be tooling along on my 10-
6   speed bike on the promenade,
7   my face will be as intense
8   as a canteloupe and
9   in my knapsack
10   there could be a
11   bible, along with the
12   liverwurst sandwich and
13   the red red
14   apple.


15   off to one side the
16   sea will break and
17   break
18   and I will
19   pump along---a
20   well-lived
21   man,
22   lived a little, per-
23   haps, beyond his
24   sensibilities: too
25   much hair in the
26   ears, and face
27   badly shaven;
28   there, my lips
29   never again to
30   kiss a
31   virgin; I gulp in
32   the salty air
33   while being
34   unsure of the
35   time
36   but almost sure

[Page 218 ]


37   of the
38   place.


39   all right, gliding
40   along
41   girding up for the
42   casket,
43   the sun like a
44   yellow glove to
45   grab me
46   I pass a group of
47   young ones
48   sitting in their
49   convertible.


50   "Jesus Christ," I hear
51   a voice, "do you
52   know who that
53   /was?/ "


54   was?
55   /was?/


56   why, you little
57   fart bells!
58   you bits of
59   bunny
60   droppings!


61   I kick it
62   into high, I
63   rise over a
64   hill
65   into a patch
66   of fog,
67   my legs
68   pump and
69   the
70   sea
71   breaks.

        Bukowski, Charles :  small cafe [from The Last Night of the
        Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   you take a stool, unfold the paper, the waitress brings the
2   java, you order bacon and
3   everybody in there is old and bent and poor, they are like
4   the oldest people in the universe
5   having breakfast
6   and it's dark in there like the inside of a glove
7   and some of the patrons speak to each other,
8   only their voices are broken and scratched and they speak
9   of simple things,
10   so simple
11   you think that they are joking but
12   they hulk over their food, unsmiling ...
13   "Casmir died, he wore his green shoes ..."
14   "yeh."


15   strange place there, no sadness, no rancor, an overhead
16   fan turns slowly, one of the blades bent a bit, it
17   clicks against the grate: "a-flick, a-flick, a-flick ..."
18   nobody
19   notices.


20   my food arrives, it is hot and clean, but never coffee
21   like that (the worst), it is like drinking the water left in muddy
22   footprints.


23   the old waitress is a dear, dressed in faded pink, she can
24   hardly walk, she's
25   /sans everything/ .


26   "do you really love me?" she asks the young Mexican fry
27   cook. "why?"


28   "because I can't help it," he says, running the spatula
29   under a mass of hash browns, turning
30   them.

[Page 220 ]




31   I eat, peruse the newspaper, general idea I get is
32   that the world is not yet about to end but a
33   recession is to come creeping in wearing
34   faded tennis
35   shoes.


36   an old man looms in the doorway, he's big in all the
37   wrong ways and shuts out what little light there
38   is.


39   "hey, anybody seen Vern?"


40   there is no answer, the old man
41   waits, he waits a good minute and a half, then he lets out a
42   little fart.
43   I can hear it, everybody can. uh
44   huh.
45   he reaches up, scratches behind his left ear, then backs out of
46   the doorway and is
47   gone.


48   "that ratfucker," somebody says, "zinched little Laura out of
49   her dowry."


50   the last bit of toast sogs down my throat, I wipe my mouth, leave
51   the tip, rise to pay the
52   bill.


53   the cash register is the old fashioned kind where the
54   drawer jumps out when you hit the
55   keys.


56   I was the last person to sit down to eat, I am the first to
57   leave, the others still sit
58   fiddling with their food, fighting the coffee
59   down


60   as I get to my car I start the engine, think,
61   nice place, rather like an accidental
62   love, maybe I'll go back there

[Page 221 ]


63   once or
64   twice.


65   then I back out, swing around and enter the
66   real world
67   again.

        Bukowski, Charles :  washrag [from The Last Night of the Earth
        Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   leaving for the track in the morning
2   my wife asks me,
3   "did you wring out your washrag
4   properly?"


5   "yes," I say.


6   "you never do," she says,
7   "it's important that you wring out
8   your washrag
9   properly."


10   I get into my car,
11   start it,
12   back out the drive.


13   of course, she's right, it is
14   important.
15   on the other hand
16   I don't want to get into an
17   argument over
18   washrags.


19   she waves goodbye,
20   I wave back,
21   then I turn left,
22   go down the hill.


23   it is a fine sunny
24   day
25   and great matters loom
26   across the horizon
27   of
28   history.
29   Carthage in my rearview
30   mirror,
31   I blend into
32   Time.

        Bukowski, Charles :  sitting with the IBM [from The Last Night
        of the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   another still, hot summer night,
2   the small insects circle my wineglass, my
3   winebottle.


4   I once again consider my death
5   as a Brahms symphony ends upon the
6   radio.


7   the horses didn't run today (not
8   here) but there was gunfire, murder,
9   bombings in many parts of the
10   earth.
11   there is always a contest
12   of sorts
13   at hand.


14   and the years move slow and the years
15   move fast and the years move
16   past.


17   it seems not so long ago that
18   old Henry Miller was still
19   alive,
20   always finding new young girls to dust
21   his lampshades, pose for him, and make him
22   nice little meals.
23   what a ladies' man, he could never get
24   enough of them.


25   anyhow, my 5 cats dislike the heat, they
26   sit outside under the cool juniper bushes
27   listening to me
28   type.
29   sometimes they bring me presents:
30   birds or mice.
31   then we have a little misunder-
32   standing.

[Page 224 ]




33   and they back off
34   looking at me
35   and their eyes say: this guy's nuts,
36   he doesn't know that this is the way
37   it works.


38   another hot summer night as I sit here
39   and play at being a writer
40   again.
41   and the worst thing
42   of course
43   is that the words will never
44   truly break through for any of
45   us.


46   some nights I have taken the sheet
47   out of the typer and
48   held it over the cigarette
49   lighter, flicked
50   it and waited for the
51   result.


52   "Hank, are you burning things again?"
53   my wife will ask.


54   anyhow, there's another composer on the
55   radio now
56   and there is only so much he can do
57   with his notes.
58   I am proud for him and yet
59   sad for him too.


60   the radio is old and dusty
61   and through
62   the speaker
63   he talks to me.


64   it's as if he were hiding in there
65   and I want to console him, say:

[Page 225 ]


66   "I am sorry, poor fellow, but
67   creation has its
68   limits."


69   another hot summer night
70   another sheet of paper in this machine,
71   more insects, more cigarettes in
72   this place, this time, hurrah hurrah, lost
73   in the grisly multitude of days
74   the speaker in the radio vibrates, trembles
75   as the composer swells out at me, the
76   son of a bitch is good
77   so brave despite his limitations
78   as the cats wait under the juniper
79   bushes and I pour more wine, more wine,
80   more wine.


[Page 226 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  my buddy, the buddha [from The Last Night
        of the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I must wash this buddha that sits on my desk---
2   dust and grime all over him
3   mostly on his chest and belly; ah,
4   we have endured many long nights together; we have
5   endured trivia and horror; at unseemly times we
6   have laughed
7   cleanly---now
8   the least he deserves is a good
9   going over
10   with a wet rag;
11   truly terrible have been
12   some long nights but
13   the buddha has been good, quiet
14   company; he never quite looks at me but
15   he seems to be forever laughing---he's
16   laughing at this muck of
17   existence: there's nothing to be done.


18   "why clean me?" he now asks, "I will only dirty
19   again."
20   "I am only pretending at some dumb sanity," I
21   answer.
22   "drink your wine," he responds, "that's what
23   you're good at."
24   "and," I ask, "what are you good
25   at?"
26   he returns: "I am good at almost watching
27   you."


28   then he becomes silent.
29   he holds a circle of beads with a
30   tassel.


31   how did he get in
32   here?


[Page 227 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  the interviewers [from The Last Night of
        the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the interviewers come around
2   and there is nothing that you can
3   really
4   tell them.


5   it's
6   embarrassing
7   and the easiest way out
8   is to get yourself
9   and them
10   drunk.


11   sometimes there is also a
12   camera man and a sound
13   man
14   and so it becomes a
15   party with
16   many bottles
17   needed.


18   I don't think they want to
19   hear the literary crap
20   either.


21   it seems to work out all
22   right:
23   I get letters
24   later:


25   "I really had a good
26   time ..."


27   or: "it was the best time
28   I /ever/ had."


29   how strange, when all I
30   remember

[Page 228 ]


31   of any particular night is
32   saying goodbye at the
33   door
34   with: "don't leave
35   anything behind so you
36   have to
37   come back."


[Page 229 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  freaky time [from The Last Night of the
        Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the lady down at the end of the bar keeps looking at
2   me, I put my head down, I look away, I light
3   a cigarette, glance again: she's still staring at me, she's
4   charmingly dressed and she, herself, well, you might
5   say she's beautiful.
6   her eyes meld with mine; I am
7   elated and nervous, then
8   she gets up, goes to the ladies' room:
9   /such a behind!/
10   /such grace!/
11   /what a gazelle!/


12   I glance at my face in the bar mirror, look
13   away.


14   she's back; then the barkeep comes down: "a drink
15   from the lady at the end of the bar."


16   I nod thanks to her, lift my drink, smile, have a
17   hit.


18   she is looking again, what a strange and pleasur-
19   able experience.


20   I look forward, examine the backs of my hands---not
21   bad hands as far as hands go.


22   then, at once, it occurs to me:
23   she has mistaken me for somebody
24   else.


25   I leave my stool and slowly walk to the exit,
26   and out into the night; I walk half a block down the
27   boulevard, feel the need for a smoke, slip the
28   pack of cigarettes out of my coat pocket, look
29   curiously at the brand name (I did /not/ purchase

[Page 230 ]


30   these): DEATH, it
31   says.


32   I curse, hurl the pack into the street, move toward
33   the next bar: knew it all along: she was a
34   whore.


[Page 231 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  the aliens [from The Last Night of the
        Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   you may not believe it
2   but there are people
3   who go through life with
4   very little
5   friction or
6   distress.
7   they dress well, eat
8   well, sleep well.
9   they are contented with
10   their family
11   life.
12   they have moments of
13   grief
14   but all in all
15   they are undisturbed
16   and often feel
17   very good.
18   and when they die
19   it is an easy
20   death, usually in their
21   sleep.


22   you may not believe
23   it
24   but such people do
25   exist.


26   but I am not one of
27   them.
28   oh no, I am not one
29   of them,
30   I am not even near
31   to being
32   one of
33   them

[Page 232 ]


34   but they are
35   there


36   and I am
37   here.


[Page 233 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  shock treatment [from The Last Night of the
        Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   the fight I saw,
2   after the tv cameras were
3   shut off,
4   a fighter in green
5   trunks and
6   a fighter in blue,
7   only 50 to 75
8   absolutely silent
9   people
10   remaining,
11   you heard each
12   blow
13   land
14   crushingly
15   amid
16   sweat, saliva
17   blood,
18   gasps of
19   agony,
20   drinks no longer
21   served,
22   all the lights
23   on,
24   thousands of
25   empty
26   seats,
27   the bell rang
28   to end the
29   round,
30   it clanged
31   right through
32   you
33   as the boxers
34   went back
35   sat on their
36   stools
37   and were

[Page 234 ]


38   swabbed by
39   listless
40   cornermen.
41   we were all
42   in hell
43   all of us
44   and I
45   got up
46   and left
47   that time.


[Page 235 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  between races [from The Last Night of the
        Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I know that I'm not supposed to bother
2   you, he said.


3   you've got that right, I
4   answered.


5   but, he went on, I want to tell you
6   that I was up all night
7   reading your
8   latest book.
9   I've read all your
10   books.
11   I work in the
12   post office.


13   oh, I said.


14   and I want to interview you for
15   our newspaper.


16   no, I said, no
17   interview.


18   why? he asked.


19   I'm tired of interviews, they have
20   nothing to do with
21   anything.


22   listen, he went on, I'll make it
23   easy for you, I'll come to your
24   house or I'll buy you dinner at
25   Musso's.


26   no, thank you, I said.

[Page 236 ]




27   look, the interview isn't really for
28   our paper, it's for
29   me, I'm a writer and I want to get
30   out of the post
31   office.


32   listen, I said, just pull up a chair
33   and sit down at your
34   typewriter.


35   no interview? he asked.


36   no, I answered.


37   he walked
38   off.


39   they were coming out on the track
40   for the next race.


41   talking to the young man had
42   made me feel
43   bad.


44   they thought that writing had
45   something to do with
46   the politics of the
47   thing.


48   they were simply not
49   crazy enough
50   in the head
51   to sit down to a
52   typer
53   and let the words bang
54   out.


55   they didn't want to
56   write

[Page 237 ]


57   they wanted to
58   succeed at
59   writing.


60   I got up to make
61   my bet.


62   no use letting a little
63   conversation
64   ruin your
65   day.


[Page 238 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  splashing [from The Last Night of the Earth
        Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   dumb,
2   Jesus Christ,
3   some people are so dumb
4   you can hear them
5   splashing around
6   in their dumbness
7   as their eyes
8   look out of their
9   heads.
10   they have
11   most of their
12   parts: hands, feet,
13   ears, legs, elbows,
14   intestines, fingernails,
15   noses and so
16   forth
17   but
18   there's nothing
19   there
20   yet
21   they are able to
22   speak,
23   form sentences---
24   but what
25   comes out
26   of their mouths
27   are the stalest
28   concepts, the most
29   warped beliefs,
30   they are the repository
31   of all the obvious
32   stupidities
33   they have
34   stuffed
35   themselves
36   with

[Page 239 ]


37   and it hurts me
38   to
39   look at them
40   to
41   listen to them,
42   I want to
43   run and hide
44   I want to
45   escape their engulfing
46   nullity


47   there is no
48   horror movie
49   worse,
50   no murder
51   as
52   unsolved


53   but
54   the world
55   goes on
56   and
57   they
58   go on


59   dumbly
60   slamming
61   my guts to
62   pieces.


[Page 240 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  darkling [from The Last Night of the Earth
        Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   some nights you don't sleep.
2   of course
3   having 3 or 4 cats on the bed
4   doesn't help.
5   my wife likes to carry them up
6   from downstairs
7   but
8   it's not always the cats, it's
9   hardly anything,
10   say,
11   re-working horse systems in my
12   brain, or it's a cold moon, an
13   itchy back, the
14   thought of death out
15   there
16   beyond the venetian blinds
17   or
18   I'll think nice things about my
19   wife, she looks so small there
20   under the blanket, a little
21   lump, that's all
22   (death, you take me first, please,
23   this lady needs a gentle space of
24   peace
25   without me).


26   then a boat horn blows from the
27   harbor.
28   I pull my head up, stretching
29   my thick neck, I see the
30   clock:
31   3:36 a.m.
32   that always does it: looking at
33   the clock.
34   by 3:45 a.m. I am asleep, just
35   like the cats, just like my

[Page 241 ]


36   wife,
37   the venetian blinds closing us
38   all in.

        Bukowski, Charles :  Celine with cane and basket [from The Last
        Night of the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   tonight I am nothing
2   I have lost touch with the walls
3   I have seen too many heads, hands, feet,
4   heard too many voices,
5   I am weary with the continuation,
6   the music is old music,
7   there is no stirring in the air.


8   on my wall is a photo of
9   Celine,
10   he has a cane,
11   carries a basket,
12   wears a coat too heavy,
13   a long strand of hair falls across his face,
14   he has been stunned by life,
15   the dogs have had at him,
16   it got to be too much
17   much too much.


18   he walks through a small forest,
19   this doctor,
20   this typer of words,
21   all he wants to do is die,
22   that's all he wants,
23   and his photo is on the wall
24   and he is dead.


25   this year
26   1988
27   all these months
28   have had
29   a terribleness to them
30   that I have never felt
31   before.


32   I light a cigarette and
33   wait.

1   editor, critic, bigot, wit:
2   what do you expect of me
3   now that my youth has
4   flown and even my middle-

7   I expect what I've always
8   expected:
9   the hard-driven line
10   and a bit of help
11   from the
12   gods.


13   as the walls get closer

        Bukowski, Charles :  the lost and the desperate [from The Last
        Night of the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   it was nice to be a boy in a dark movie house,
2   one entered the dream so much more easily
3   then.
4   I liked the French Foreign Legion movies
5   best and there were many of them
6   then.


7   I loved the forts and the sand and the
8   lost and desperate men.
9   these men were brave and they had beautiful
10   eyes.


11   I never saw men like that
12   in my neighborhood.
13   the neighborhood men were hunched and
14   miserable and angry and
15   cowardly.


16   I was going to join the French Foreign Legion.


17   I sat in the dark movie houses and I was
18   one of them.


19   we had been fighting for days without food
20   and with very little
21   water.


22   casualties had been horrendous.


23   our fort was surrounded, we were down to a
24   last few.
25   we propped up our dead comrades with
26   their rifles pointed toward the
27   desert
28   to make the Arabs think that they had not
29   killed many of us

[Page 245 ]


30   otherwise we would have been
31   overwhelmed.


32   we ran from dead man to dead man
33   firing their rifles.
34   our sergeant was wounded
35   3 or 4 times but
36   he still commanded
37   screaming his orders.


38   then more of us died gallantly, then
39   we were down to the last two
40   (one of them the sergeant) but we
41   fought on, then we were out of
42   ammunition, the Arabs scaled the walls
43   on ladders and we knocked them back
44   with our rifle butts but more and more of
45   them were clambering over the walls, there
46   were too many
47   of them we were
48   finished, no chance, then there was the sound of a
49   BUGLE!
50   reinforcements were arriving!
51   fresh and rested upon the backs of thunderous
52   horses!
53   they charged en masse over the sand,
54   hundreds of them
55   dressed in bright and blazing uniforms.
56   the Arabs scattered down the walls
57   running for their horses and their
58   lives
59   but most of them were
60   doomed.


61   then the sergeant, knowing victory, was dying
62   in my arms.
63   "Chinaski," he said to me, "the fort is
64   ours!"
65   he gave a small smile, his head fell back and
66   he was gone.

[Page 246 ]




67   then I was home again
68   I was back in my room.
69   a hunched, miserable and angry man
70   walked into the room and said,
71   "get out there now and mow the lawn.
72   I see a hair of grass sticking up!"


73   out there in the yard
74   I pushed the mower over the same grass
75   once more
76   back and forth
77   back and forth
78   wondering why all the brave men with
79   beautiful eyes were so far away,
80   wondering if they'd still be there
81   when I arrived.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the bully [from The Last Night of the Earth
        Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   actually, I do think that
2   my father was
3   insane,
4   the way he drove his
5   car,
6   honking,
7   cursing at people;
8   the way he got into
9   violent arguments
10   in public places
11   over the most
12   trivial incidents;
13   the way he beat
14   his only child
15   almost daily
16   upon the slightest
17   provocation.


18   of course, bullies
19   sometimes meet their
20   masters.


21   I remember once
22   entering the house
23   and my mother
24   told me,
25   "your father was
26   in a terrible
27   fight."


28   I looked for him,
29   found him sitting
30   on the toilet
31   with the bathroom
32   door
33   open.

[Page 248 ]




34   his face was a mass of
35   bruises, welts,
36   puffed and black
37   eyes.
38   he even had a broken
39   arm
40   in a cast.


41   I was 13 years old.
42   I stood looking
43   at him.
44   I looked for
45   some time.


46   then he screamed,
47   "what the hell you
48   staring at!
49   what's your
50   problem?"


51   I looked at him
52   some more,
53   then walked
54   off.


55   it was to be
56   3 years later
57   that
58   I would knock him
59   on his
60   ass, no problem
61   with that
62   at
63   all.

        Bukowski, Charles :  get close enough and you can't see [from
        The Last Night of the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   at this time
2   I know a couple of men
3   who seem to be in
4   love
5   while their ladies are treating
6   them
7   off-handedly or
8   worse.


9   these men are consumed by
10   their
11   ill-fate, can't
12   climb out of their
13   fix.


14   I too
15   have been in that
16   way,
17   only I was
18   worse
19   off:
20   I was charmed and
21   ensnared by
22   caseic beldames,
23   slimey slatterns,
24   inchoate prostitutes,
25   hypacodont
26   mesdames---
27   all the hustling
28   shrews of the
29   universe
30   found me,
31   and I
32   found them
33   wise
34   witty and

[Page 252 ]


35   beautiful
36   then.


37   it was only after
38   some luck of
39   distance and time
40   that I was able to
41   realize
42   that
43   these ladies
44   were even less than
45   less.


46   so
47   now
48   when these men
49   tell me their sad
50   stories
51   there is nothing I can
52   say
53   because to me
54   their women look
55   like
56   hypacodont
57   beldames,
58   inchoate
59   slatterns,
60   caseic
61   mesdames
62   and
63   slimey
64   prostitutes,
65   not to mention
66   piss-biting
67   shrews


68   and they
69   most
70   probably
71   are.

[Page 253 ]




72   true is true
73   enough,
74   yet
75   at small
76   tiny and
77   rare
78   moments


79   I wonder
80   what
81   I seemed
82   like
83   to my
84   ladies?


[Page 254 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  the beggars [from The Last Night of the
        Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the poor
2   in the grandstand section
3   playing the
4   daily doubles
5   the exactas
6   the pick-6's
7   the pick-9's


8   they have horrible
9   jobs
10   or
11   no jobs


12   they come in
13   beaten
14   to take another
15   beating.


16   scuffed shoes
17   shirts with buttons
18   missing,
19   faded and wrinkled
20   clothing---
21   muted eyes,
22   they are the
23   unwashed
24   the
25   unwanted


26   the beggars of the
27   grandstand


28   and as race after race
29   unfolds
30   they are routinely
31   sucked of
32   money and
33   hope

[Page 255 ]


34   then
35   the last race is
36   over


37   and for a few
38   there's the
39   liquor
40   store


41   a bit to drink
42   and a
43   lottery
44   ticket.


45   for the
46   others:
47   nothing.


48   beggars of the
49   grandstand.


50   the State is going
51   to
52   make it.


53   the track is going
54   to
55   make
56   it


57   thanks to the
58   Days of the Living
59   Dead.


60   well,
61   the horses are
62   beautiful
63   anyhow.

1   he wears the same pants
2   the same coat
3   the same shoes
4   day after day.


5   his shirttail hangs out.
6   his shoes are unlaced.
7   his hair is white and
8   uncombed.
9   he is balding.


10   he walks slowly to make his
11   bets, then
12   walks slowly back to his
13   seat.


14   he watches each race
15   without emotion.


16   he is hooked on nothing but
17   an impossibility.


18   he is so tired.


19   the old horseplayer.


20   the skies, the mountains,
21   music, nothing matters to
22   him.


23   he's hooked on an
24   impossibility.

1   some of the old rich still make it to
2   Santa Anita Turf Club parking.
3   and the old rich still buy Cadillacs---
4   and he can barely drive the Caddy---
5   and the valet helps them both
6   out.
7   he's fat and squat, very white, with
8   merry blue eyes and she's taller,
9   dignified but dumb, and her back is
10   bent.
11   expensively clothed
12   they both move toward the Turf Club
13   entrance
14   where they are swallowed forever
15   as the horn sounds to post
16   and the number one horse steps out
17   on the track
18   more beautiful than all the people
19   more beautiful than all the world
20   and it
21   begins.


[Page 258 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  off and on [from The Last Night of the
        Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   at times I still consider coughing it up: gas pipe, 19th floor
2   window, 3 fifths of whiskey in 4 hours or
3   slamming at 85 mph into a slab of
4   concrete.


5   my first thought of suicide came at age 13 and it has
6   been with me ever since
7   through all the botched failures:
8   sometimes just rather playing at it, little minor
9   rehearsals;
10   other times
11   really trying like hell to
12   kill myself.


13   yet, now it's never totally intense, it's more like
14   considering whether to go to a movie or
15   not or whether to buy a new pair of
16   shoes.
17   actually, years go by and the suicidal thoughts
18   almost completely
19   abate.
20   then
21   suddenly
22   they return, like:
23   look here, baby, let's give it another
24   shot.


25   and when it returns it's fairly
26   compelling
27   but not so much in the mind (as in the old
28   days) but strangely, suicide waits in odd little places,
29   on the back of your neck or
30   at a spot just under the chin
31   or along the arms like the sleeves of a
32   sweater ...
33   it used to hit the gut, now it's almost like

[Page 259 ]


34   catching a
35   rash.


36   I will be driving along in my car with the radio
37   on and it will leap at me and I will smile at
38   it
39   remembering the old days
40   when those I knew thought that
41   my daring crazy acts stemmed from
42   bravery ...


43   I will drive for several hours
44   up and down strange streets in
45   strange neighborhoods
46   at times
47   slowing down carefully
48   where children are playing in the
49   road.


50   I will park
51   go into cafes
52   drink coffee
53   read newspapers.
54   I will hear voices speaking of
55   ridiculous and dull
56   things.


57   I will be back in the car
58   driving along
59   and at once
60   everything will lift:
61   we all live in the same world:
62   I will have to pay my gas bill, get a
63   set of new reading glasses, I will need a
64   new tire
65   left rear
66   and I think I've been using my neighbor's
67   garbage can.

[Page 260 ]




68   it is fine to be normal again and
69   as I pull into the driveway
70   a large white moon smiles at me
71   through the windshield of
72   evening.


73   I brake, get out, close the car
74   door, centuries of sadness, gladness and
75   equilibrium will walk with me up to the door
76   as I put in the key
77   unlock it
78   walk into the place
79   once again having escaped the
80   inescapable, I will move toward the
81   kitchen cabinet for the
82   bottle
83   to
84   celebrate
85   that
86   or
87   whatever there is,
88   isn't,
89   will be,
90   won't
91   be---
92   like right
93   now.

        Bukowski, Charles :  balloons [from The Last Night of the Earth
        Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   today they shot a guy who was
2   selling balloons at the
3   intersection.


4   they parked their cars at the
5   curbing
6   and called him
7   over.


8   he came
9   over.


10   they argued with him about
11   the price of a
12   balloon, they wanted him
13   to come down in
14   price.


15   he said he couldn't.


16   one of them started calling
17   him names.


18   the other took out a gun
19   and shot him in the
20   head.
21   twice.


22   he fell
23   right there
24   in the street.


25   they took his balloons,
26   said, "now we can
27   party," and then they
28   drove off

[Page 262 ]




29   there are also other guys
30   at that intersection, they
31   sell oranges
32   mostly.


33   they left then
34   and they weren't at the
35   intersection the next day
36   or the next or
37   the next.


38   nobody was.


[Page 263 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  recognized [from The Last Night of the
        Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I was at the airport
2   standing at the arrival section
3   with my wife
4   waiting for her sister's
5   flight in
6   when a young man walked up:
7   "aren't you Henry Chinaski?"
8   "well, yes ..."
9   "oh, I thought so!"
10   there was a pause.
11   then
12   he continued: "you don't
13   know what this
14   means to me!
15   I can't believe it!
16   I've read all your books!"
17   "thank you," I said, "I have to be
18   thankful for my
19   readers."
20   he gave me his name and we
21   shook hands.
22   "this is my wife," I started ...
23   " /Sarah!/ " he said, "I /know/ her
24   from your books!"
25   another pause.
26   then:
27   "I get all your books from Red
28   down at Baroque ...
29   I still can't believe it's
30   you!"
31   "it is," laughed my wife,
32   "it's him!"
33   "well," he said, "I'll leave you
34   alone now!"
35   "tell Red I said 'hello.'"
36   then the young man
37   moved off.

[Page 264 ]




38   "he was all right," I said,
39   "I usually can't stand
40   them."


41   "like you say, you have to
42   be thankful for your
43   readers."


44   "damned right ..."


45   then her sister's plane tooled
46   up and we moved with the others
47   to greet those we knew and those
48   who knew
49   us.


[Page 265 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  them and us [from The Last Night of the
        Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   they were all out on the front porch
2   talking:
3   Hemingway, Faulkner, T. S. Eliot,
4   Ezra Pound, Hamsun, Wally Stevens,
5   e. e. cummings and a few others.


6   "listen," said my mother, "can't you
7   ask them to stop talking?"


8   "no," I said.


9   "they are talking garbage," said my
10   father, "they ought to get
11   jobs."


12   "they have jobs," I
13   said.


14   "like hell," said my
15   father.


16   "exactly," I
17   said.


18   just then Faulkner came
19   staggering in.
20   he found the whiskey in the
21   cupboard and went outside with
22   it.


23   "a terrible person,"
24   said my mother.


25   then she got up and peeked out
26   on the porch.

[Page 266 ]




27   "they've got a woman with them,"
28   she said, "only she looks like a
29   man."


30   "that's Gertrude," I
31   said.


32   "there's another guy flexing his
33   muscles," she said, "he claims he
34   can whip any three of
35   them."


36   "that's Ernie," I said.


37   "and /he/ ," my father pointed to me,
38   "wants to be like /them!/ "


39   "is that true?" my mother asked.


40   "not like them," I said, "but of
41   them."


42   "you get a god-damned job,"
43   said my father.


44   "shut up," I said.


45   "what?"


46   "I said, 'shut up,' I am listening to
47   these men."


48   my father looked at his wife:
49   "this is no son of
50   mine!"


51   "I hope not," I said.


52   Faulkner came staggering into the room
53   again.

[Page 267 ]




54   "where's the telephone?" he
55   asked.


56   "what the hell for?" my father
57   asked.


58   "Ernie's just blown his brains
59   out," he said.


60   "you see what happens to men like
61   that?" screamed my father.


62   I got up
63   slowly
64   and helped Bill find
65   the
66   telephone.

        Bukowski, Charles :  luck was not a lady [from The Last Night of
        the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   being half-young I sat about the bars
2   in it up to the ears
3   thinking something might happen to
4   me, I mean, I tried the ladies:
5   "hey, baby, listen, the golden coast
6   weeps for your beauty ..."
7   or some such.


8   their heads never turned, they looked
9   ahead, straight ahead,
10   bored.


11   "hey, baby, listen, I am a
12   genius, ha ha ha ..."


13   silent before the bar mirror, these
14   magic creatures, these secret sirens,
15   big-legged, bursting out of their
16   dresses, wearing dagger
17   heels, earrings, strawberry mouths,
18   just sitting there, sitting there,
19   sitting there.


20   one of them told me, "you bore
21   me."


22   "no, baby, you got it
23   backwards ..."


24   "oh, shut up."


25   then in would walk some dandy, some fellow
26   neat in a suit, pencil mustache, bow tie;
27   he would be slim, light, delicate
28   and so knowing
29   and the ladies would call his

[Page 269 ]


30   name: "oh, Murray, Murray!"
31   or some such.


32   "hi, girls!"


33   I knew I could deck one of those
34   fuckers but that hardly mattered in the
35   scheme of things,
36   the ladies just gathered around Murray
37   (or some such) and I just kept ordering
38   drinks,
39   sharing the juke music with them
40   and listening to the laughter from
41   the outside.


42   I wondered what wonderful things
43   I was missing, the secret of the
44   magic, something that only they knew,
45   and I felt myself again the idiot in the
46   schoolyard, sometimes a man never got out
47   of there---he was marked, it could be told
48   at a glance


49   and so
50   I was shut out,
51   "I am the lost face of
52   Janus," I might say at some
53   momentary silence.
54   of course, to be
55   ignored.


56   they'd pile out
57   to cars parked in back
58   smoking
59   laughing
60   finally to drive off
61   to some consummate
62   victory

[Page 270 ]




63   leaving me
64   to keep on drinking
65   just me
66   sitting there
67   then the face of the
68   bartender near
69   mine:


70   "LAST CALL!"
71   his meaty indifferent face
72   cheap in the cheap
73   light


74   to have my last drink
75   go out to my ten year old car
76   at the curb
77   get in
78   to drive ever so carefully
79   to my rented
80   room


81   remembering the schoolyard
82   again,
83   recess time,
84   being chosen next to last
85   on the baseball team,
86   the same sun shining on me
87   as on them,
88   now it was night,
89   most people of the world
90   together.
91   my cigarette dangling,
92   I heard the sound of the
93   engine.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the editor [from The Last Night of the
        Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   he sat in the kitchen at the breakfastnook table
2   reading the manuscripts writing a short rejection
3   on each replacing the paperclip then
4   sliding the pages back into the brown
5   manila envelopes.


6   he'd been reading for an hour and thirty-five
7   minutes and hadn't found a single poem


8   well he'd have to do the usual thing
9   for the next issue: write the poems himself and
10   make up names for the authors.


11   where was the talent?


12   for the last 3 decades the poets had
13   flattened
14   out it was like reading stuff
15   from a house of
16   subnormals.


17   but
18   he'd save Rabowski
19   for last


20   Rabowski had sent 8 or ten poems in a batch
21   but always there were one or two
22   good ones.


23   he sighed and pulled out the Rabowski
24   poems.


25   he slowly read them he finished


26   he got up went to the refrigerator
27   got out

[Page 272 ]




28   a can of beer cracked it sat back
29   down


30   he read the poems all over again they were
31   all bad even Rabowski had
32   crapped out.


33   the editor got out a printed rejection slip
34   wrote "you must have had a bad
35   week."


36   then he slipped the poems back into the
37   manila envelope sealed it tossed it
38   on top of the pile for mailing


39   then he took the beer sat down next to his wife
40   on the couch


41   she was watching Johnny Carson
42   he watched


43   Carson was bad Carson knew he was bad but
44   he couldn't do anything about
45   it.


46   the editor got up with his can of beer and
47   began walking up the
48   stairway.


49   "where are you going?" his wife
50   asked.


51   "to bed to sleep."


52   "but it's early."


53   "god damn it I know that!"


54   "well you needn't act /that way/
55   about it!"

[Page 273 ]




56   he walked into the bedroom flicked on
57   the wall switch
58   there was a small bright flash and then
59   the overhead light burned
60   out.


61   he sat on the edge of the bed and finished his
62   beer in the
63   dark.

        Bukowski, Charles :  duck and forget it [from The Last Night of
        the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   today at the track
2   I was standing alone
3   looking down
4   when I saw these
5   two shoes
6   moving directly
7   toward
8   me


9   at once
10   I started into motion
11   toward my right
12   but he still caught part of
13   me:


14   "making any money
15   today?"


16   "yeah," I answered and
17   was gone.


18   not too many years ago
19   I would have stood
20   there
21   while this slipped
22   soul
23   unloaded his
24   inanities on
25   me
26   pissing over my day
27   and my feelings
28   as he made me pay
29   for where he allowed
30   himself to be
31   in his mind
32   and in his
33   life.

[Page 275 ]


34   no longer.


35   yet I am my brother's
36   keeper.


37   I keep him
38   away.

        Bukowski, Charles :  snapshots at the track [from The Last Night
        of the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I go to the men's crapper
2   for a bowel
3   movement,
4   get up to flush.
5   what the hell.
6   something blood-dark
7   falls upon the
8   seat.
9   I'm 70, I
10   drink.
11   have been on my deathbed
12   twice.
13   I reach down for what has
14   fallen ...
15   it's a small burnt
16   potato chip
17   from my
18   lunch.
19   not yet ...
20   damn thing fell from my
21   shirt ...


22   I finish my toiletry,
23   go out and watch the
24   race.
25   my horse runs
26   second
27   chasing a 25-to-one
28   shot
29   to the
30   wire.


31   I don't mind.


32   then I see this fellow
33   rushing toward me,
34   he always needs a
35   shave, his glasses seem

[Page 277 ]


36   about to fall off
37   his face,
38   he knows me
39   and maybe I know
40   him.


41   "hey, Hank, Hank!"


42   we shake hands like two
43   lost souls.
44   "always good to see you,"
45   he says, "it refreshes
46   me, I know you lead a
47   hard life
48   just like I
49   do."


50   "sure, kid, how you
51   doing?"


52   he tells me that he is
53   a big winner
54   then
55   rushes off.
56   the big board
57   overhead
58   flashes the first odds
59   on the next
60   race.


61   I check my program
62   decide to leave the
63   clubhouse,
64   try my luck in the
65   grandstand,
66   that's where a hard-
67   living player belongs
68   anyhow,
69   right?


70   right.

        Bukowski, Charles :  x-idol [from The Last Night of the Earth
        Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I never watch tv so I don't know
2   but I'm told he was the leading man in a
3   long-running
4   series.
5   he does movie bits
6   now
7   I see him at the track almost every
8   day ("I used to have women coming out of
9   my ass," he once informed me).
10   and people still remember him, call him
11   by name and my wife often asks me, "did
12   you see him today?"
13   "oh yes, he's a gambling son of a bitch."


14   the track is where you go when the other
15   action drops away.


16   he still looks like a celebrity, the way
17   he walks and talks and
18   I never meet him without feeling
19   good.


20   the toteboard flashes.


21   the sky shakes.


22   the mountains call us home.

        Bukowski, Charles :  heat wave [from The Last Night of the Earth
        Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   another one.
2   this night the people sit drunk or drugged or some of them
3   sit in front of their tv sets
4   slapped silly.
5   some few have air-conditioning.


6   the neighborhood dogs and cats flop about
7   waiting for a better time.


8   and I remember the cars along the freeway today
9   some of them stalled in the fast lane,
10   hoods up.


11   there are more murders in the heat
12   more domestic arguments.


13   Los Angeles has been burning for
14   weeks.


15   even the desperately lonely have not phoned
16   and that alone
17   makes all this almost
18   worthwhile:


19   those little mewling voices cooked into
20   silence
21   as I listen to the music of a long dead man
22   written in the 19th
23   century.

        Bukowski, Charles :  we ain't got no money, honey, but we got
        rain [from The Last Night of the Earth Poems (1992) , Black
        Sparrow Press ]



1   call it the greenhouse effect or whatever
2   but it just doesn't rain like it
3   used to.


4   I particularly remember the rains of the
5   depression era.
6   there wasn't any money but there was
7   plenty of rain.


8   it wouldn't rain for just a night or
9   a day,
10   it would RAIN for 7 days and 7
11   nights
12   and in Los Angeles the storm drains
13   weren't built to carry off that much
14   water
15   and the rain came down THICK and
16   MEAN and
17   STEADY
18   and you HEARD it banging against
19   the roofs and into the ground
20   waterfalls of it came down
21   from the roofs
22   and often there was HAIL
23   big ROCKS OF ICE
24   bombing
25   exploding
26   smashing into things
27   and the rain
28   just wouldn't
29   STOP
30   and all the roofs leaked---
31   dishpans,
32   cooking pots
33   were placed all about;
34   they dripped loudly
35   and had to be emptied

[Page 281 ]


36   again and
37   again.


38   the rain came up over the street curbings,
39   across the lawns, climbed the steps and
40   entered the houses.
41   there were mops and bathroom towels,
42   and the rain often came up through the
43   toilets: bubbling, brown, crazy, whirling,
44   and the old cars stood in the streets,
45   cars that had problems starting on a
46   sunny day,
47   and the jobless men stood
48   looking out the windows
49   at the old machines dying
50   like living things
51   out there.


52   the jobless men,
53   failures in a failing time
54   were imprisoned in their houses with their
55   wives and children
56   and their
57   pets.
58   the pets refused to go out
59   and left their waste in
60   strange places.


61   the jobless men went mad
62   confined with
63   their once beautiful wives.
64   there were terrible arguments
65   as notices of foreclosure
66   fell into the mailbox.
67   rain and hail, cans of beans,
68   bread without butter; fried
69   eggs, boiled eggs, poached
70   eggs; peanut butter
71   sandwiches, and an invisible

[Page 282 ]


72   chicken
73   in every pot.


74   my father, never a good man
75   at best, beat my mother
76   when it rained
77   as I threw myself
78   between them,
79   the legs, the knees, the
80   screams
81   until they
82   separated.


83   " /I'll kill you/ ," I screamed
84   at him. " /You hit her again/
85   /and I'll kill you!/ "


86   " /Get that son-of-a-bitching/
87   kid out of here!"


88   "no, Henry, you stay with
89   your mother!"


90   all the households were under
91   siege but I believe that ours
92   held more terror than the
93   average.


94   and at night
95   as we attempted to sleep
96   the rains still came down
97   and it was in bed
98   in the dark
99   watching the moon against
100   the scarred window
101   so bravely
102   holding out
103   most of the rain,
104   I thought of Noah and the
105   Ark

[Page 283 ]




106   and I thought, it has come
107   again.
108   we all thought
109   that.


110   and then, at once, it would
111   stop.
112   and it always seemed to
113   stop
114   around 5 or 6 a.m.,
115   peaceful then,
116   but not an exact silence
117   because things continued to
118   drip
119   drip
120   drip


121   and there was no smog then
122   and by 8 a.m.
123   there was a
124   blazing yellow sunlight,
125   Van Gogh yellow---
126   crazy, blinding!
127   and then
128   the roof drains
129   relieved of the rush of
130   water
131   began to expand in
132   the warmth:
133   PANG! PANG! PANG!


134   and everybody got up
135   and looked outside
136   and there were all the lawns
137   still soaked
138   greener than green will ever
139   be
140   and there were the birds
141   on the lawn
142   CHIRPING like mad,

[Page 284 ]


143   they hadn't eaten decently
144   for 7 days and 7 nights
145   and they were weary of
146   berries
147   and
148   they waited as the worms
149   rose to the top,
150   half-drowned worms.
151   the birds plucked them
152   up
153   and gobbled them
154   down; there were
155   blackbirds and sparrows.
156   the blackbirds tried to
157   drive the sparrows off
158   but the sparrows,
159   maddened with hunger,
160   smaller and quicker,
161   got their
162   due.


163   the men stood on their porches
164   smoking cigarettes,
165   now knowing
166   they'd have to go out
167   there
168   to look for that job
169   that probably wasn't
170   there, to start that car
171   that probably wouldn't
172   start.


173   and the once beautiful
174   wives
175   stood in their bathrooms
176   combing their hair,
177   applying makeup,
178   trying to put their world back
179   together again,
180   trying to forget that

[Page 285 ]


181   awful sadness that
182   gripped them,
183   wondering what they could
184   fix for
185   breakfast.


186   and on the radio
187   we were told that
188   school was now
189   open.
190   and
191   soon
192   there I was
193   on the way to school,
194   massive puddles in the
195   street,
196   the sun like a new
197   world,
198   my parents back in that
199   house,
200   I arrived at my classroom
201   on time.


202   Mrs. Sorenson greeted us
203   with, "we won't have our
204   usual recess, the grounds
205   are too wet."


206   "AW!" most of the boys
207   went.


208   "but we are going to do
209   something special at
210   recess," she went on,
211   "and it will be
212   fun!"


213   well, we all wondered
214   what that would
215   be

[Page 286 ]


216   and the two hour wait
217   seemed a long time
218   as Mrs. Sorenson
219   went about
220   teaching her
221   lessons.


222   I looked at the little
223   girls, they all looked so
224   pretty and clean and
225   alert,
226   they sat still and
227   straight
228   and their hair was
229   beautiful
230   in the California
231   sunshine.


232   then the recess bell rang
233   and we all waited for the
234   fun.


235   then Mrs. Sorenson told
236   us:
237   "now, what we are going to
238   do is we are going to tell
239   each other what we did
240   during the rainstorm!
241   we'll begin in the front
242   row and go right around!
243   now, Michael, you're
244   first!..."


245   well, we all began to tell
246   our stories, Michael began
247   and it went on and on,
248   and soon we realized that
249   we were all lying, not
250   exactly lying but mostly
251   lying and some of the boys

[Page 287 ]


252   began to snicker and some
253   of the girls began to give
254   them dirty looks and
255   Mrs. Sorenson said,
256   "all right, I demand a
257   modicum of silence
258   here!
259   I am interested in what
260   you did
261   during the rainstorm
262   even if you
263   aren't!"


264   so we had to tell our
265   stories and they /were/
266   stories.


267   one girl said that
268   when the rainbow first
269   came
270   she saw God's face
271   at the end of it.
272   only she didn't say
273   which end.


274   one boy said he stuck
275   his fishing pole
276   out the window
277   and caught a little
278   fish
279   and fed it to his
280   cat.


281   almost everybody told
282   a lie.
283   the truth was just
284   too awful and
285   embarrassing to
286   tell.

[Page 288 ]




287   then the bell rang
288   and recess was
289   over.


290   "thank you," said Mrs.
291   Sorenson, "that was very
292   nice.
293   and tomorrow the grounds
294   will be dry
295   and we will put them
296   to use
297   again."


298   most of the boys
299   cheered
300   and the little girls
301   sat very straight and
302   still,
303   looking so pretty and
304   clean and
305   alert,
306   their hair beautiful
307   in a sunshine that
308   the world might
309   never see
310   again.

        Bukowski, Charles :  crime and punishment [from The Last Night
        of the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   Mr. Sanderson was the principal of
2   my high school
3   and it seemed that much
4   of the time
5   I was in Mr. Sanderson's
6   office
7   and I had no idea
8   why.


9   the teacher would send me down
10   with a sealed
11   envelope.
12   Mr. Sanderson would open the
13   envelope
14   read the enclosure
15   and then look at
16   me.


17   "well, here we are
18   again!
19   we just /can't/ behave our-
20   selves, can
21   we?"


22   he always said the same
23   thing.
24   I rather liked the idea of
25   being bad
26   but I had no idea
27   that I
28   was.


29   I didn't protest
30   because
31   I thought that
32   the teachers were
33   stupid

[Page 290 ]


34   and that
35   Mr. Sanderson was
36   stupid
37   so
38   there was nobody
39   to protest
40   to.
41   certainly not
42   my parents
43   who were more stupid
44   than
45   any of
46   them.


47   "all right," Mr. Sanderson would
48   say, "go into the phone booth,
49   close the door
50   and don't come out until I
51   tell you
52   to."


53   it was one of those
54   glassed in phone booths with a
55   little seat.
56   all the times I sat there
57   the phone never
58   rang.
59   and it was stuffy
60   in there.
61   all you could do in there
62   was think
63   and I didn't want to
64   think.
65   Mr. Sanderson knew that.
66   there were magazines in
67   there
68   but they were all dull,
69   fancy ladies
70   magazines
71   but I read them

[Page 291 ]


72   anyhow
73   and that really made me
74   feel bad
75   which was what Mr.
76   Sanderson wanted.


77   finally
78   after one or two hours
79   he would bang on the
80   door with his big
81   fist and yell, "ALL RIGHT,
82   YOU CAN COME OUT OF THERE
83   NOW
84   AND I DON'T EVER WANT TO
85   SEE YOU IN HERE AGAIN!"


86   but
87   I'd be back
88   many times


89   never knowing
90   why.


91   finally
92   like somebody doing
93   time
94   I got out of that
95   high school
96   and it was a couple
97   of years later
98   that I read
99   in the newspaper
100   that Mr. Sanderson
101   had been
102   prosecuted
103   fined and
104   jailed
105   for
106   embezzlement of

[Page 292 ]


107   school
108   funds.


109   while I had been
110   in that phone booth
111   diddling with
112   myself
113   that son of a
114   bitch
115   had been making
116   his
117   moves.


118   I felt like
119   going down to
120   the jail
121   and dumping a
122   bunch of
123   /Ladies' Home Journal/
124   on him
125   but of course
126   I didn't.
127   I felt good enough
128   about it
129   just the way it
130   was.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the soldier, his wife and the bum [from The
        Last Night of the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I was a bum in San Francisco but once managed
2   to go to a symphony concert along with the well-
3   dressed people
4   and the music was good but something about the
5   audience was not
6   and something about the orchestra
7   and the conductor was
8   not,
9   although the building was fine and the
10   acoustics perfect
11   I preferred to listen to the music alone
12   on my radio
13   and afterwards I did go back to my room and I
14   turned on the radio but
15   then there was a pounding on the wall:
16   "SHUT THAT GOD-DAMNED THING OFF!"


17   there was a soldier in the next room
18   living with his wife
19   and he would soon be going over there to pro-
20   tect me from Hitler so
21   I snapped the radio off and then heard his
22   wife say, "you shouldn't have done that."
23   and the soldier said, "FUCK THAT GUY!"
24   which I thought was a very nice thing for him
25   to tell his wife to do.
26   of course,
27   she never did.


28   anyhow, I never went to another live concert
29   and that night I listened to the radio very
30   quietly, my ear pressed to the
31   speaker.


32   war has its price and peace never lasts and
33   millions of young men everywhere would die
34   and as I listened to the classical music I

[Page 294 ]


35   heard them making love, desperately and
36   mournfully, through Shostakovich, Brahms,
37   Mozart, through crescendo and climax,
38   and through the shared
39   wall of our darkness.

        Bukowski, Charles :  Bonaparte's Retreat [from The Last Night of
        the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   Fred, they called him.
2   he always sat at the end of the
3   bar
4   near the doorway
5   and he was always there
6   from opening to
7   closing.
8   he was there more than
9   I was,
10   which is saying
11   something.


12   he never talked to
13   anybody.
14   he just sat there
15   drinking his glasses of
16   draft beer.
17   he looked straight ahead
18   right across the bar
19   but he never looked at
20   anybody.


21   and there's one other
22   thing.


23   he got up
24   now and then
25   and went to the
26   jukebox
27   and he always played the
28   same record:
29   /Bonaparte's Retreat/ .


30   he played that song
31   all day and all night
32   long.

[Page 296 ]


33   it was his song,
34   all right.


35   he never got tired
36   of it.


37   and when his draft beers
38   really got to him
39   he'd get up and play
40   /Bonaparte's Retreat/
41   6 or 7 times
42   running.


43   nobody knew who he was or
44   how he made
45   it,
46   only that he lived in a
47   hotel room
48   across the street
49   and was the first customer
50   in the bar
51   each day
52   as it
53   opened.


54   I protested to Clyde
55   the bartender:
56   "listen, he's driving us
57   crazy with that
58   thing.
59   eventually, all the other
60   records are
61   rotated
62   but
63   /Bonaparte's Retreat/
64   remains.
65   what does it
66   mean?"


67   "it's his song,"
68   said Clyde.

[Page 297 ]


69   "don't you have a
70   song?"


71   well, I came in about one
72   p.m. this day
73   and all the regulars
74   were there
75   but Fred wasn't
76   there.


77   I ordered my drink,
78   then said out loud,
79   "hey, where's
80   Fred?"


81   "Fred's dead,"
82   said Clyde.


83   I looked down at the end
84   of the bar.
85   the sun came through the
86   blinds
87   but there was nobody
88   at the end
89   stool.


90   "you're kidding me,"
91   I said, "Fred's back in the
92   crapper or
93   something."


94   "Fred didn't come in this
95   morning," said Clyde, "so
96   I went over to his
97   hotel room
98   and there he
99   was
100   stiff as a
101   cigar
102   box."

[Page 298 ]




103   everybody was very
104   quiet.
105   those guys never said
106   much
107   anyhow.


108   "well," I said, "at least
109   we won't have to hear
110   /Bonaparte's Retreat/
111   anymore."


112   nobody said
113   anything.


114   "is that record
115   still in the
116   juke?" I
117   asked.


118   "yes," said
119   Clyde.


120   "well," I said,
121   "I'm going to play it
122   one more time."


123   I got up.


124   "hold it,"
125   said Clyde.


126   he came around the bar,
127   walked to the
128   juke
129   box.


130   he had a little key
131   in his
132   hand.

[Page 299 ]




133   he put the key
134   in the juke
135   and opened
136   it.


137   he reached in
138   and pulled
139   out a
140   record.


141   then he took the
142   record and
143   broke it over
144   his
145   knee.


146   "it was his
147   song," said
148   Clyde.


149   then he locked
150   the juke,
151   took the broken
152   record
153   behind the bar
154   and
155   trashed
156   it.


157   the name of the
158   bar
159   was
160   /Jewel's/ .
161   it was at
162   Crenshaw and
163   Adams
164   and it's not
165   there
166   anymore.

        Bukowski, Charles :  flat tire [from The Last Night of the Earth
        Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   got a flat on the freeway
2   11 a.m.
3   going north
4   I got over to the
5   side
6   a small strip
7   on the freeway
8   edge
9   got out the jack
10   and the
11   spare
12   went to
13   work
14   the big rigs
15   going by
16   blasts of air and
17   noise
18   shaking everything
19   and to top it
20   all
21   it was
22   cold
23   an icy
24   wind
25   and I thought,
26   Jesus Christ, mercy,
27   can I do this
28   thing?
29   this would be a
30   good place to
31   go crazy and
32   chuck it all
33   in


34   but I got the
35   new wheel
36   on,

[Page 301 ]


37   the old one
38   in the trunk
39   and then I was
40   back in the
41   car


42   I gunned it into
43   the swirl of
44   traffic
45   and there I was
46   like nothing
47   had ever
48   happened


49   moving along
50   with everybody
51   else


52   all of us
53   caught up in our
54   petty larcenies
55   and our
56   rotting
57   virtues


58   I gunned it
59   hard
60   made the fast
61   lane


62   pushed the
63   button
64   as my radio
65   antenna
66   sliced into the
67   sky.

        Bukowski, Charles :  oh, I was a ladies' man! [from The Last
        Night of the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   you
2   wonder about
3   the time
4   when
5   you ran through women
6   like an open-field
7   maniac
8   with this total
9   disregard for
10   panties, dish towels,
11   photos
12   and all the other
13   accoutrements---
14   like
15   the tangling of
16   souls.


17   what
18   were you
19   trying to
20   do
21   trying to
22   catch up
23   with?


24   it was like a
25   hunt.
26   how many
27   could you
28   bag?
29   move
30   onto?


31   names
32   shoes
33   dresses
34   sheets, bathrooms

[Page 303 ]


35   bedrooms, kitchens
36   back
37   rooms,
38   cafes,
39   pets,
40   names of pets,
41   names of children;
42   middle names, last
43   names, made-up
44   names.


45   you proved it was
46   easy.
47   you proved it
48   could be done
49   again and
50   again,
51   those legs held
52   high
53   behind most of
54   you.
55   or
56   they were on top
57   or
58   you were
59   behind
60   or
61   both
62   sideways
63   plus
64   other
65   inventions.


66   songs on radios.
67   parked cars.
68   telephone voices.
69   the pouring of
70   drinks.
71   the senseless
72   conversations.

[Page 304 ]


73   now you know
74   you were nothing but a
75   fucking
76   dog,
77   a snail wrapped around
78   a snail---
79   sticky shells in the
80   sunlight, or in
81   the misty evenings,
82   or in the dark
83   dark.


84   you were
85   nature's
86   idiot,
87   not proving but
88   being
89   proved.
90   not a man but a
91   plan
92   unfolding,
93   not thrusting but
94   being
95   pierced.
96   now
97   you know.


98   then
99   you thought you were
100   such a
101   clever devil
102   such a
103   cad
104   such a
105   man-bull
106   such a
107   bad boy


108   smiling over your
109   wine

[Page 305 ]


110   planning your next
111   move


112   what a
113   waste of time
114   you were


115   you great
116   rider
117   you Attila of
118   the springs and
119   elsewhere


120   you could have
121   slept through it
122   all
123   and you would never
124   have been
125   missed


126   never would have
127   been
128   missed
129   at
130   all.

        Bukowski, Charles :  inactive volcano [from The Last Night of
        the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the bartender at Musso's
2   remembers me when
3   I was
4   in rags,
5   used to
6   lean on the wood
7   with the
8   worst and loudest of
9   women
10   and
11   we would
12   drink too much
13   spill our drinks
14   get
15   nasty.


16   now
17   I enter
18   quietly with an
19   interviewer
20   a film director
21   or some
22   actor
23   or
24   with my wife
25   and a gentle
26   friend or
27   two.


28   at times
29   now
30   I see the bartender
31   looking at me
32   and I know
33   he's thinking
34   of back then
35   the way it

[Page 307 ]


36   was
37   and I look
38   back at him
39   and my eyes
40   send the
41   message:
42   I'm just the
43   same, friend, only
44   the circumstances
45   have
46   altered
47   but
48   I'm
49   the same.


50   then I
51   turn back
52   to
53   whomever
54   I am with
55   and they
56   too
57   seem to be
58   thinking,
59   when is he
60   going to go
61   crazy
62   again?


63   nothing
64   to do,
65   friend,
66   but
67   wait
68   and
69   see.

        Bukowski, Charles :  creative writing class [from The Last Night
        of the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I'm guilty, I did take one
2   in college
3   and the first thing I realized was that
4   I could beat the hell out of any
5   2 or 3 people in there
6   at once
7   (physically
8   I mean)
9   and
10   of course
11   this was no way to measure
12   creativity.


13   also
14   I noticed that the professor's advice
15   on what to do
16   and what not to do
17   to become a writer was
18   very pale and standard stuff
19   that would lead to
20   nowhere.


21   some of the students' work
22   was read in class
23   and I found it to be embarrassingly
24   inept.


25   I sat alone in the back row with
26   my scowl
27   further noting that
28   the men didn't look like men and
29   the women didn't look like women.
30   again
31   no way to judge creativity.
32   but what they produced
33   looked like
34   what they were.

[Page 309 ]




35   well
36   at least the prof did give me
37   "A's" on all the work
38   I turned in
39   but I got a "B" overall for
40   poor attendance.


41   I also knew that
42   every student in that class
43   except one
44   was
45   creatively doomed.


46   and even that one
47   would be 50 years old
48   before even minor notice
49   would be taken of
50   his work.


51   a bit longer
52   than even he
53   had
54   expected.


[Page 310 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  cool black air [from The Last Night of the
        Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   often from my typing room I step out onto this small
2   balcony
3   and there is the night
4   a cool wash of black air.
5   I stand in slippers, shorts and undershirt, sucking at
6   a small cigarette, I can see the curling headlights of
7   the cars on the winding Harbor Freeway.
8   they come and come, those lights, they never stop
9   and I truly wonder that life is still here
10   after all these centuries, after the hell of
11   all of our error and our smallness and our
12   greed, our
13   selfishness, our bitterness,
14   life is still here
15   and the thought of that makes me strangely
16   elated.
17   of course, I am woozy from hours of
18   typing.


19   and now
20   the same dog in that yard to the far left barks at me
21   again.


22   he should know that old fart standing there in his shorts,
23   he should know me by now.


24   I turn and walk back into my typing room.


25   the typewriter is electric and it is on and it
26   /hums hums hums hums/ .


27   last night I did something very odd: after ripping out
28   a few poems
29   I covered the machine
30   then bent down and kissed it once, and said,
31   "thank you, very much."

[Page 311 ]


32   after 50 years in the game I had finally thanked my
33   typewriter.


34   now I sit down to it and I BANG IT, I don't use the light
35   touch, I BANG IT, I want to hear it, I want it to do its
36   tricks, it has saved my ass from the worst of women and the
37   worst of men and the
38   worst of jobs, it has mellowed my nightmares into a gentle
39   sanity, it has loved me at my lowest and it has made me
40   seem to be a greater soul than I ever
41   was.


42   I BANG IT I BANG IT


43   and I know how all of them felt, all the writers, when it was
44   going good, when it was going hot.


45   death, I have chopped off your arms and your legs and your
46   head.


47   I am sorry, I know you just do what you have to
48   do


49   even to that barking dog


50   but now
51   I BANG IT
52   BANG IT


53   and wait.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the jackals [from The Last Night of the
        Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   as the years went on I seemed to have more luck
2   but now these jackals
3   these attackers from the past reappear as if
4   nothing had ever
5   occurred (one doesn't mind literary
6   criticism so long as the envy and the rancor
7   do not show through)
8   and now I meet the jackals in eating
9   places etc.
10   some even come to the door
11   bringing entire families---mothers, fathers,
12   old aunts ...


13   the jackals turn on the charm
14   and I don't mind, let the past be
15   done, I pour the drinks and
16   listen.


17   it is afterwards that it occurs, usually
18   within a week:
19   a large manuscript arrives with
20   note: "could you read this?
21   publisher would like a foreword from
22   you ..."


23   I brace myself, flop on the bed, give it
24   a read: the writing is proficient
25   but somewhere there is a terrible
26   lacking, an unnatural void ...
27   the manuscript makes me a bit ill;
28   I let it fall to the
29   floor.



30   the other night I made a brief
31   appearance at a theater where my
32   video was showing and

[Page 313 ]


33   as I was leaving
34   here came the poet, glass of
35   cheap free wine in his hand, he
36   poked his face into mine
37   and repeated his /same/ speech all
38   over again as if he had forgotten
39   he had given it
40   to me before.


41   "remember me? we met at L's.
42   there's this new mag starting, it's
43   going to be better than /Rolling/
44   /Stone .../
45   what they want me to do is
46   interview you and you interview me,
47   we get a thousand a-piece, maybe
48   more ..."


49   (said jackal had attacked me in an
50   article after begging me to go
51   to the boxing matches with him.
52   his face was continually
53   in mine, talking, talking.
54   "listen," I told him, "let's just
55   watch the fights ..."
56   he had told
57   me he was there to cover the
58   fights, but he wasn't: the
59   article was about me: a
60   terrible human being who was a
61   drunk and far past his prime.)


62   now he kept shoving his face into
63   mine there on the sidewalk,
64   repeating his spiel: "I interview
65   you, you interview me ... one
66   thousand, what do you think, huh,
67   huh?"

[Page 314 ]




68   "I'll let you know," I told
69   him.


70   but he just kept walking along,
71   pushing his face into mine ...


72   well, I thought, I am going to
73   have to punch him out.


74   but I tried something else
75   first:


76   "get the fuck away from me!"


77   he backed off and I walked off
78   to a better place ...



79   give it a week, I came in from the
80   track one evening and here was a
81   large package: 3 of his latest
82   books from a local press.
83   I flipped through the pages:
84   a breezy, bantering style
85   playing the open, good
86   human guy but it was like he
87   was writing on benzedrine
88   lashing you with shreds of his
89   soul,
90   but it was more boring-
91   than derring-
92   do.


93   there was a note with phone
94   number, home address:
95   "I'll interview you, you
96   interview me, the editor thinks
97   it's a great idea ... and there's a
98   grand a-piece in it for each of
99   us, maybe more ..."

[Page 315 ]




100   I walked into the kitchen and
101   dumped him into the trash
102   bag.


103   I fed the cats and then the phone
104   rang.
105   it was a new voice:


106   "Chinaski?"


107   "yes?"


108   "listen, you don't know me
109   but my name is Dipper
110   and I got a great deal for
111   you."


112   "listen, how did you get my
113   phone number?"


114   "hey, man, what difference
115   does /that/ make?"


116   I hung up.


117   in a moment the phone was ringing
118   again.


119   I walked into the front room
120   looked out the south window, it
121   looked fine out there: trees, lawn,
122   shrubbery,
123   not a jackal in
124   sight.

        Bukowski, Charles :  Dinosauria, we [from The Last Night of the
        Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   born like this
2   into this
3   as the chalk faces smile
4   as Mrs. Death laughs
5   as the elevators break
6   as political landscapes dissolve
7   as the supermarket bag boy holds a college degree
8   as the oily fish spit out their oily prey
9   as the sun is masked


10   we are
11   born like this
12   into this
13   into these carefully mad wars
14   into the sight of broken factory windows of emptiness
15   into bars where people no longer speak to each other
16   into fist fights that end as shootings and knifings


17   born into this
18   into hospitals which are so expensive that it's cheaper to die
19   into lawyers who charge so much it's cheaper to plead guilty
20   into a country where the jails are full and the madhouses closed
21   into a place where the masses elevate fools into rich heroes


22   born into this
23   walking and living through this
24   dying because of this
25   muted because of this
26   castrated
27   debauched
28   disinherited
29   because of this
30   fooled by this
31   used by this
32   pissed on by this
33   made crazy and sick by this
34   made violent

[Page 320 ]


35   made inhuman
36   by this


37   the heart is blackened
38   the fingers reach for the throat
39   the gun
40   the knife
41   the bomb
42   the fingers reach toward an unresponsive god


43   the fingers reach for the bottle
44   the pill
45   the powder


46   we are born into this sorrowful deadliness
47   we are born into a government 60 years in debt
48   that soon will be unable to even pay the interest on that debt
49   and the banks will burn
50   money will be useless
51   there will be open and unpunished murder in the streets
52   it will be guns and roving mobs
53   land will be useless
54   food will become a diminishing return
55   nuclear power will be taken over by the many
56   explosions will continually shake the earth
57   radiated robot men will stalk each other
58   the rich and the chosen will watch from space platforms
59   Dante's Inferno will be made to look like a children's playground


60   the sun will not be seen and it will always be night
61   trees will die
62   all vegetation will die
63   radiated men will eat the flesh of radiated men
64   the sea will be poisoned
65   the lakes and rivers will vanish
66   rain will be the new gold


67   the rotting bodies of men and animals will stink in the dark wind


68   the last few survivors will be overtaken by new and hideous diseases

[Page 321 ]


69   and the space platforms will be destroyed by attrition
70   the petering out of supplies
71   the natural effect of general decay


72   and there will be the most beautiful silence never heard


73   born out of that.


74   the sun still hidden there


75   awaiting the next chapter.

        Bukowski, Charles :  cut while shaving [from The Last Night of
        the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   It's never quite right, he said, the way the people look,
2   the way the music sounds, the way the words are
3   written.
4   it's never quite right, he said, all the things we are
5   taught, all the loves we chase, all the deaths we
6   die, all the lives we live,
7   they are never quite right,
8   they are hardly close to right,
9   these lives we live
10   one after the other,
11   piled there as history,
12   the waste of the species,
13   the crushing of the light and the way,
14   it's not quite right,
15   it's hardly right at all
16   he said.


17   don't I know it? I
18   answered.


19   I walked away from the mirror.
20   it was morning, it was afternoon, it was
21   night


22   nothing changed
23   it was locked in place.
24   something flashed, something broke, something
25   remained.


26   I walked down the stairway and
27   into it.


[Page 323 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  a good job [from The Last Night of the
        Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   some jobs you like,
2   there is a clean gentle
3   feel to some of them,
4   like the one I had
5   unloading boxcars
6   of frozen
7   fish.


8   the fish came packed
9   in coffin-sized boxes,
10   beautifully
11   heavy and
12   almost
13   unyielding.
14   you had thick gloves
15   and a hook
16   and you gaffed the
17   damned thing
18   and pulled it along
19   the floor and slid it
20   outside and onto the
21   waiting
22   truck.


23   and strangely there
24   was no foreman,
25   they just turned us
26   loose in there
27   knowing we'd get
28   it done.


29   we were always
30   sending out one of
31   the fellows for another
32   bottle of
33   wine.
34   it was slippery and

[Page 324 ]


35   cold in those
36   boxcars


37   we yanked out those
38   iced fish,
39   drank the wine
40   and the bullshit
41   flew.
42   there was a
43   fight or two
44   but nothing really
45   violent.
46   I was the peace-
47   maker.


48   "come on, fuck
49   that stuff!
50   let's get these
51   fish out of
52   here!
53   yeah!"


54   then we'd be
55   laughing and
56   bullshitting
57   again.


58   toward evening
59   we all got quiet.
60   the fish seemed to
61   get heavier and
62   heavier.
63   shins got cracked,
64   knees
65   bruised
66   and the wine
67   settled heavily
68   into our
69   guts.

[Page 325 ]




70   by the time you
71   got to your last box
72   you bullied it
73   out of there
74   strictly on nerve
75   alone.


76   when you punched
77   out
78   even the timecard
79   seemed
80   heavy.


81   and then you were
82   in your old car
83   moving toward
84   your place,
85   your shackjob,
86   wondering
87   whether good times
88   or hell
89   awaited
90   you.


91   but the frozen fish
92   you had
93   worked,
94   that thought was
95   pleasant and
96   soothing,
97   and you'd be back
98   for more,
99   hooking the wood
100   and dragging.


101   the night came
102   on and you flicked
103   the headlights
104   on

[Page 326 ]


105   and the world was
106   good enough,
107   right
108   then.


[Page 327 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  last seat at the end [from The Last Night
        of the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I was always studying the wood of the
2   bar, the grains, the scratches, the
3   cigarette burns.
4   there was something there but I
5   couldn't quite figure what it
6   was
7   and that kept me going.


8   another one was to look at my
9   hand around the
10   glass.
11   there is something about
12   one's hand about a
13   glass that is gently
14   fascinating.


15   and, of course, there is this one:
16   all drunks do it:
17   taking your thumbnail and slowly
18   ripping off the label
19   on a bottle of beer that has been
20   soaking in the icewater.


21   smoking cigarettes is a good show
22   too, especially in the early morning
23   hours with the Venetian blinds at
24   your back,
25   the smoke curls up and forms its
26   divergent patterns.
27   this gives one the feeling of
28   peace
29   and really so, more so,
30   if there is one of your favorite
31   old songs
32   emanating from the
33   juke.

[Page 328 ]




34   and if the bartender was old
35   and a little tired and a little bit
36   wise
37   it was good to see where he
38   was or what he was doing---
39   washing glasses or leaning
40   against the counter or
41   sneaking a quick
42   shot
43   or whatever he was doing
44   it was always nice to just
45   see a bit of him,
46   to take note of the white
47   shirt.
48   the white shirt was an
49   important backdrop to
50   drink to and
51   with.


52   also you listened to the
53   traffic going by,
54   car by car.
55   it was not a deliberate
56   listening---more an off-
57   hand
58   one.
59   and it was best when
60   it had rained
61   and you could hear the
62   tires on the
63   wet street.


64   the bar was the best
65   place to hide in.
66   time came under your
67   control, time to wade
68   in, time to do nothing
69   in.

[Page 329 ]


70   no guru was needed,
71   no god.


72   nothing expected but
73   yourself
74   and nothing lost
75   to the
76   unexpected.

        Bukowski, Charles :  my uncle Jack [from The Last Night of the

1   my uncle Jack
2   is a mouse
3   is a house on fire
4   is a war about to begin
5   is a man running down the street with a knife in his back.


6   my uncle Jack
7   is the Santa Monica pier
8   is a dusty blue pillow
9   is a scratching black-and-white dog
10   is a man with one arm lighting a cigarette with one hand.


11   my uncle Jack
12   is a slice of burnt toast
13   is the place you forgot to look for the key
14   is the pleasure of finding 3 rolls of toilet paper in the closet
15   is the worst dream you've ever had that you can't remember.


16   my uncle Jack
17   is the firecracker that went off in your hand
18   is your run-over cat dead outside your driveway at 10:30 a.m.
19   is the crap game you won in the Santa Anita parking lot
20   is the man your woman left you for that night in the cheap hotel
21   room.


22   my uncle Jack
23   is your uncle Jack
24   is death coming like a freight train
25   is a clown with weeping eyes
26   is your car jack and your fingernails and the scream of the biggest
27   mountain now.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the area of pause [from The Last Night of
        the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   you have to have it or the walls will close
2   in.
3   you have to give everything up, throw it
4   away, everything away.
5   you have to look at what you look at
6   or think what you think
7   or do what you do
8   or
9   don't do
10   without considering personal
11   advantage
12   without accepting guidance.


13   people are worn away with
14   striving,
15   they hide in common
16   habits.
17   their concerns are herd
18   concerns.


19   few have the ability to stare
20   at an old shoe for
21   ten minutes
22   or to think of odd things
23   like who invented the
24   doorknob?


25   they become unalive
26   because they are unable to
27   pause
28   undo themselves
29   unkink
30   unsee
31   unlearn
32   roll clear.

[Page 332 ]


33   listen to their untrue
34   laughter, then
35   walk
36   away.

        Bukowski, Charles :  my first computer poem [from The Last Night

1   have I gone the way of the deathly death?
2   will this machine finish me
3   where booze and women and poverty
4   have not?


5   is Whitman laughing at me from his grave?
6   does Creeley care?


7   is this properly spaced?
8   am I?


9   will Ginsberg howl?


10   soothe me!


11   get me lucky!


12   get me good!


13   get me going!


14   I am a virgin again.


15   a 70 year old virgin.


16   don't fuck me, machine


17   do.
18   who cares?


19   talk to me, machine!


20   we can drink together.
21   we can have fun.


22   think of all the people who will hate me at this
23   computer.

[Page 334 ]




24   we'll add them to the others
25   and continue right
26   on.


27   so this is the beginning
28   not the
29   end.

        Bukowski, Charles :  Rossini, Mozart and Shostakovich [from The
        Last Night of the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   are who I will hear tonight
2   after reading about the death of Red Grange.
3   my wife and I ate at a Japanese restaurant tonight
4   and I told her that Red Grange had died.
5   I had red bean ice cream for dessert.
6   my wife declined.
7   the war was still on in the Gulf.
8   we got into the car and I drove us back here.
9   now I am listening to Rossini
10   who died before Red Grange.
11   now the audience is applauding.
12   now the players are readying for Mozart.
13   Red Grange got a hell of a write-up in the papers.
14   now Mozart is beginning.
15   I am smoking a small cigarette imported from India.
16   4 of my 6 cats are asleep in the next room.
17   my wife is downstairs.
18   outside it is a cold, still winter night.
19   I blow smoke into the desk lamp and watch it curl.
20   Mozart is doing very well.
21   Shostakovich is getting ready.
22   it is a late Tuesday evening.
23   and Red Grange is dead.


[Page 336 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  it's a shame [from The Last Night of the
        Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   a great mind and a good body seldom go
2   together.
3   or a great body and a good
4   mind.
5   or a great body and a great
6   mind.


7   but worse, a not so good mind and a
8   not so good body often go
9   together.


10   in fact, that's almost the entire
11   populace.
12   and all these
13   reproducing more of
14   themselves.


15   is there any wonder why the world
16   is where it's at
17   now?


18   just notice the creature sitting near you
19   in a movie house
20   or standing ahead of you in a
21   supermarket line.
22   or giving a State of the Union
23   Address.


24   that the gods have let us go on
25   this long
26   this badly.


27   as the snail comes crawling home
28   to manna.

        Bukowski, Charles :  what a writer [from The Last Night of the
        Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   what I liked about e. e. cummings
2   was that he cut away from
3   the holiness of the
4   word
5   and with charm
6   and gamble
7   gave us lines
8   that sliced through the
9   dung.


10   how it was needed!
11   how we were withering
12   away
13   in the old
14   tired
15   manner.


16   of course, then came all
17   the
18   e. e. cummings
19   copyists.
20   they copied him then
21   as the others had
22   copied Keats, Shelley,
23   Swinburne, Byron, et
24   al.


25   but there was only
26   one
27   e. e. cummings.
28   of course.


29   one sun.


30   one moon.

[Page 338 ]




31   one poet,
32   like
33   that.

        Bukowski, Charles :  hangovers [from The Last Night of the Earth
        Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I've probably had about more of them
2   than any person alive
3   and they haven't killed me
4   yet
5   but some of those mornings felt
6   awfully near
7   death.


8   as you know, the worst drinking is done
9   on an empty stomach, while smoking
10   heavily and downing many different
11   types of
12   libations.


13   and the worst hangovers are when you
14   awaken in your car or in a strange room
15   or in an alley or in jail.


16   the worst hangovers are when you
17   awaken to realize that you have done
18   something absolutely vile, ignorant and
19   possibly dangerous the night before
20   but
21   you can't quite remember what it
22   was.


23   and you awaken in various states of
24   disorder---parts of your body
25   damaged, your money missing
26   and/or possibly and often your
27   car, if you had one.


28   you might place a telephone call to
29   a lady, if you were with one, most
30   often to have her slam the phone
31   down on you.
32   or, if she is next to you then,

[Page 340 ]


33   to feel her bristling and outrageous
34   anger.


35   drunks are never forgiven.


36   but drunks will forgive themselves
37   because they need to drink
38   again.


39   it takes an ungodly durability to
40   be a drinking person for many
41   decades.


42   your drinking companions are
43   killed by it.
44   you yourself are in and out of
45   hospitals
46   where the warning often is:
47   "One more drink will kill
48   you."
49   but
50   you beat that
51   by taking more than one more
52   drink.


53   and as you near three quarters of
54   a century in age
55   you find that it takes more and more
56   booze to get you
57   drunk.


58   and the hangovers are worse,
59   the recovery stage is
60   longer.


61   and the most remarkably stupid
62   thing is
63   that you are not unpleased that
64   you have done it
65   all

[Page 341 ]


66   and that you are still
67   doing it.


68   I am typing this now
69   under the yoke of one of my
70   worst hangovers
71   while downstairs now
72   sit various and sundry
73   bottles of
74   alcohol.


75   it's all been so beastly
76   lovely,
77   this mad river,
78   this gouging
79   plundering
80   madness
81   that I would wish upon
82   nobody
83   but myself,
84   amen.

        Bukowski, Charles :  they are everywhere [from The Last Night of
        the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the tragedy-sniffers are all
2   about.
3   they get up in the morning
4   and begin to find things
5   wrong
6   and they fling themselves
7   into a rage about
8   it,
9   a rage that lasts until
10   bedtime,
11   where even there
12   they twist in their
13   insomnia,
14   not able to rid their
15   minds
16   of the petty obstacles
17   they have
18   encountered.


19   they feel set against,
20   it's a plot.
21   and by being constantly
22   angry they feel that
23   they are constantly
24   right.


25   you see them in traffic
26   honking wildly
27   at the slightest
28   infraction,
29   cursing,
30   spewing their
31   invectives.


32   you feel them
33   in lines
34   at banks

[Page 343 ]


35   at supermarkets
36   at movies,
37   they are pressing
38   at your back
39   walking on your
40   heels,
41   they are impatient to
42   a fury.


43   they are everywhere
44   and into
45   everything,
46   these violently
47   unhappy
48   souls.


49   actually they are
50   frightened,
51   never wanting to be
52   wrong
53   they lash out
54   incessantly ...
55   it is a malady
56   an illness of
57   that
58   breed.


59   the first one
60   I saw like that
61   was my
62   father


63   and since then
64   I have seen a
65   thousand
66   fathers,
67   ten thousand
68   fathers
69   wasting their lives
70   in hatred,

[Page 344 ]


71   tossing their lives
72   into the
73   cesspool
74   and
75   ranting
76   on.

1   war, war, war,
2   the yellow monster,
3   the eater of mind

5   war,

8   the mad,

10   of
11   ungrown men.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the idiot [from The Last Night of the Earth
        Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I believe the thought came to me
2   when I was about eleven years
3   old:
4   I'll become an idiot.


5   I had noticed some in the neigh-
6   borhood,
7   those who the people called
8   "idiots."


9   although looked down upon,
10   the idiots seemed to have the
11   more peaceful lives:
12   nothing was expected of
13   them.


14   I imagined myself standing upon
15   streetcorners, hands in pockets,
16   and drooling a bit at the
17   mouth.


18   nobody would bother
19   me.


20   I began to put my plan into
21   effect.


22   I was first noticed in the
23   school yards.
24   my mates jibed at me,
25   taunted me.


26   even my father noticed:
27   "you act like a god damned
28   idiot!"

[Page 347 ]




29   one of my teachers noticed,
30   Mrs. Gredis of the long silken
31   legs.


32   she kept me after
33   class.


34   "what is it, Henry?
35   you can tell me ..."


36   she put her arms
37   about me
38   and I rested myself
39   against
40   her.


41   "tell me, Henry, don't
42   be afraid ..."


43   I didn't say
44   anything.


45   "you can stay here
46   as long as you
47   want, Henry.
48   you don't have to
49   talk ..."


50   she kissed me on the
51   forehead
52   and I reached down
53   and lightly touched
54   one of her silken
55   legs.


56   Mrs. Gredis was a
57   hot number.


58   she kept me after
59   school almost every
60   day.

[Page 348 ]




61   and everybody hated
62   me
63   but I believe that I
64   had the most wonderful
65   hard-ons
66   of any eleven year old
67   boy
68   in the city of
69   Los Angeles

        Bukowski, Charles :  this rejoinder [from The Last Night of the
        Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the people survive to come up with flat fists full
2   of nothing.
3   I remember Carl Sandburg's poem, "The
4   People, Yes."
5   nice thought but completely inaccurate:
6   the people did not survive through a noble
7   strength but through lie, compromise and
8   guile.
9   I lived with these people, I am not so sure
10   what people Sandburg lived
11   with.
12   but his poem always pissed me off.
13   it was a poem that lied.
14   it is "The People, No."
15   then and now.
16   and it doesn't take a misanthrope to
17   say this.


18   let us hope that future famous poems
19   such as Mr. Sandburg's
20   make more
21   sense.

        Bukowski, Charles :  Hemingway never did this [from The Last
        Night of the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I read that he lost a suitcase full of manuscripts on a
2   train and that they never were recovered.
3   I can't match the agony of this
4   but the other night I wrote a 3-page poem
5   upon this computer
6   and through my lack of diligence and
7   practice
8   and by playing around with commands
9   on the menu
10   I somehow managed to erase the poem
11   forever.
12   believe me, such a thing is difficult to do
13   even for a novice
14   but i somehow managed to do
15   it.


16   now I don't think this 3-pager was immor-
17   tal
18   but there were some crazy wild lines,
19   now gone forever.
20   it bothers more than a touch, it's some-
21   thing like knocking over a good bottle of
22   wine.


23   and writing about it hardly makes a good
24   poem.
25   still, I thought somehow you'd like to
26   know?


27   if not, at least you've read this far
28   and there could be better work
29   down the line.


30   let's hope so, for your sake
31   and
32   mine.

        Bukowski, Charles :  surprise time again [from The Last Night of
        the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   it's always a surprise to some
2   when the killer is that clean-cut
3   quiet boy with the gentle smile
4   who went to church
5   and was nearly a straight-A
6   student
7   and also good on the athletic
8   field,
9   kind to his elders,
10   adored by the young girls,
11   the old ones,
12   admired by his
13   peers.


14   "I can't believe he did it ..."


15   they always think a killer must
16   be ugly, gross, unlikable,
17   that he must give off signs,
18   signals of anger and
19   madness.


20   sometimes these kill
21   too.


22   but a potential killer can never
23   be judged by his
24   externals


25   nor a politician, a priest or
26   a poet.


27   or the dog
28   or the woman
29   wagging
30   tails.

[Page 352 ]




31   the killer sits anywhere
32   like you
33   as you read this


34   wondering.

        Bukowski, Charles :  young in New Orleans [from The Last Night
        of the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   starving there, sitting around the bars,
2   and at night walking the streets for
3   hours,
4   the moonlight always seemed fake
5   to me, maybe it was,
6   and in the French Quarter I watched
7   the horses and buggies going by,
8   everybody sitting high in the open
9   carriages, the black driver, and in
10   back the man and the woman,
11   usually young and always white.
12   and I was always white.
13   and hardly charmed by the
14   world.
15   New Orleans was a place to
16   hide.
17   I could piss away my life,
18   unmolested.
19   except for the rats.
20   the rats in my dark small room
21   very much resented sharing it
22   with me.
23   they were large and fearless
24   and stared at me with eyes
25   that spoke
26   an unblinking
27   death.


28   women were beyond me.
29   they saw something
30   depraved.
31   there was one waitress
32   a little older than
33   I, she rather smiled,
34   lingered when she
35   brought my
36   coffee.

[Page 354 ]


37   that was plenty for
38   me, that was
39   enough.


40   there was something about
41   that city, though:
42   it didn't let me feel guilty
43   that I had no feeling for the
44   things so many others
45   needed.
46   it let me alone.


47   sitting up in my bed
48   the lights out,
49   hearing the outside
50   sounds,
51   lifting my cheap
52   bottle of wine,
53   letting the warmth of
54   the grape
55   enter
56   me
57   as I heard the rats
58   moving about the
59   room,
60   I preferred them
61   to
62   humans.


63   being lost,
64   being crazy maybe
65   is not so bad
66   if you can be
67   that way:
68   undisturbed.


69   New Orleans gave me
70   that.
71   nobody ever called
72   my name.

[Page 355 ]


73   no telephone,
74   no car,
75   no job,
76   no
77   anything.


78   me and the
79   rats
80   and my youth,
81   one time,
82   that time
83   I knew
84   even through the
85   nothingness,
86   it was a
87   celebration
88   of something not to
89   do
90   but only
91   know.

2   house.


3   "they want to send me to a rest

5   IS my home!'"


6   he speaks of his grandchildren.
7   he's outlived his
8   children.


9   he visits his wife who's also
10   95.
11   she's in a rest

13   "she looks great but she doesn't

16   breakfast cereal.


17   he lives on a steep hill.
18   used to take his little dog for

20   the dog died.


21   he walks alone now,

29   "they can't wait for me to
30   die, they want my house

33   spite them."


34   I see him in his room upstairs
35   at night
36   watching tv or
37   reading.


38   he was married longer than
39   most men
40   live.
41   he still is
42   only she doesn't know she's
43   married.


44   he sits up in his room
45   on top of nine and one
46   half
47   decades
48   neither asking nor
49   giving
50   mercy.


51   he is an ocean of

1   I suppose Jr. High was the worst.
2   my friend Teddy began going to
3   various dances
4   and talking about it all.
5   his father loaned him the car
6   for these
7   functions.


8   he also had a new wrist watch.
9   it was still the depression
10   era and few of us boys
11   had wrist
12   watches.


13   Teddy kept lifting up his wrist
14   and looking at his
15   watch.
16   he did it 3 or 4 times
17   within a ten minute
18   period.


19   "why the hell do you keep
20   looking at the time?
21   you going
22   somewhere?"


23   "maybe, maybe ..."


24   "well, go on then ..."


25   "she kissed me at the
26   doorway, I can still feel her
27   lips!"


28   "whose lips?"

29   "Annabell's, she kissed me
30   at her door after the
31   dance!"


32   "listen, Teddy, let's go down to the
33   lot and get up a
34   baseball game."


35   "I can't get her out of my mind.
36   her lips were soft,
37   warm ..."


38   "Christ, man, who
39   cares?"


40   "I bought her a corsage for
41   the dance, she looked so
42   beautiful ..."


43   "didn't you slip her any
44   turkey neck?"


45   "what?
46   listen, I'm in love!"


47   "well, that's what you do
48   then before somebody
49   else slams her."


50   "don't talk that way, I'm
51   warning you!"


52   "I can take you, Teddy,
53   with one ball tied behind
54   my back."


55   he looked at his watch:
56   "I gotta go now ..."

[Page 366 ]




57   "gonna go play with yourself,
58   Teddy?"


59   "look who's talking!
60   you don't even have a
61   girl!"


62   "you don't know what I
63   have."


64   "you've got nothing but
65   your hand."


66   "I've got two hands, Teddy."


67   I grabbed him by the shirt and
68   pulled him in
69   close.


70   "and just for laughs I just might
71   kick your ass, real
72   good."


73   "you're just pissed because
74   you've got
75   nobody!"


76   I let him go.


77   "get out of here ..."


78   Teddy turned and
79   walked off.


80   he'd gotten off easy that
81   time.
82   next time I'd kick his ass
83   from stem to
84   stern.

[Page 367 ]




85   it was 1935.
86   I was standing in my parents'
87   back yard.
88   it was a Saturday
89   afternoon.
90   my father was in the house
91   listening to the radio,
92   the Trojans were playing
93   Notre Dame.
94   my mother was in there
95   doing something and
96   nothing.


97   I walked in through the back
98   door.
99   my mother was in the
100   kitchen.


101   "Henry, I saw Teddy
102   leaving.
103   he's a nice
104   boy."


105   "yeah ..."


106   "I saw Teddy
107   all dressed up to go to
108   the dance.
109   he looked so
110   nice!"


111   "yeah ..."


112   "Henry, when are you going
113   to get a nice girl to take to
114   a dance?"


115   "I only dance with them in
116   bed!"

[Page 368 ]




117   "YOU DON'T TALK THAT WAY
118   TO YOUR MOTHER!"


119   it was my father.
120   he had been standing there.
121   it must have been half
122   time.


123   "don't bother me," I
124   said.


125   "I'LL BOTHER YOU, I'LL BOTHER
126   YOU SO YOU'LL NEVER TALK THAT
127   WAY AGAIN!"


128   "is that right, old man?
129   come on then, bother
130   me!"


131   he stood there.
132   I stood there.


133   nothing happened.


134   "ALL RIGHT," he screamed,
135   "GO TO YOUR ROOM!
136   NOW!"


137   I walked past him, on through
138   the house and out the
139   door.


140   I walked down the street.
141   I had no money, I had nowhere to
142   go.
143   I just kept
144   walking.


145   it was a hot summer day
146   and I just kept walking,

[Page 369 ]


147   3 blocks, 4 blocks, 5
148   blocks ...


149   then I passed a mongrel dog
150   going the other
151   way.


152   his fur was matted and dirty
153   and his tongue hung out of
154   one side of his
155   mouth.


156   I stopped, turned and watched
157   him trot
158   off.
159   then I faced the other way and
160   continued my
161   journey.

        Bukowski, Charles :  classical music and me [from The Last Night
        of the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I have no idea how it began.
2   as a boy I believed that classical music was
3   for sissies and as a teenager I felt this even
4   more strongly.


5   yes, I think it began in this record
6   store.
7   I was in my booth listening to whatever I
8   listened to
9   at that time.
10   then I heard some music in the next
11   booth.
12   the sounds seemed very strange and
13   unusual.
14   I saw the man leave his booth and
15   return the record to the clerk.
16   I went to the clerk and asked for that
17   record.
18   she handed it to me.
19   I looked at the cover.


20   "but," I said, "this is symphony
21   music."


22   "yes," said the clerk.


23   I took the record to my booth
24   and played it.


25   never had I heard such
26   music.
27   unfortunately, I no longer
28   remember what that
29   piece of marvelous
30   music was.

[Page 371 ]


31   I purchased the record.
32   I had a record player in my
33   room.
34   I listened to the record
35   over and over
36   again.


37   I was hooked.


38   soon I found a 2nd hand
39   record store.
40   there I found that you could
41   turn in 3 record albums and
42   get two back.


43   I was fairly poor
44   but most of my money went
45   for wine and
46   classical music.
47   I loved to mix the two
48   together.


49   I went through that entire
50   2nd hand record
51   store.


52   my tastes were strange.
53   I liked Beethoven but
54   preferred Brahms and
55   Tchaikovsky.
56   Borodin didn't work.
57   Chopin was only good
58   at moments.
59   Mozart was only good
60   when I was feeling
61   good and I seldom
62   felt that
63   way.
64   Smetana I found
65   obvious and Sibelius

[Page 372 ]


66   awesome.
67   Ives was too self-comfortable.
68   Goldmark, I felt, was very
69   underrated.
70   Wagner was a roaring miracle
71   of dark energy.
72   Haydn was love turned loose
73   into sound.
74   Handel created things that
75   took your head and lifted it
76   to the ceiling.
77   Eric Coates was unbelievably
78   cute and astute.
79   and if you listened to Bach
80   long enough
81   you didn't want to listen to
82   anybody else.
83   there were dozens
84   more....


85   I was on the move from
86   city to city
87   and carrying a record player
88   and records along was
89   impossible
90   so I began listening to the
91   radio
92   and picking up what I
93   could.


94   the problem with the radio
95   was
96   that there were a few standard
97   works they played over and
98   over.
99   I heard them too often
100   and could anticipate each note
101   before it
102   arrived.
103   but the good part was

[Page 373 ]


104   that, at times, I heard new
105   music that I had never heard
106   before by composers I had
107   never heard of, read about.
108   I was surprised at the many
109   composers, fairly unknown,
110   at least to me, who could
111   produce these wondrous
112   and stirring
113   works.
114   works that I would never
115   hear again.


116   I have continued to listen to
117   classical music via the radio
118   for decades.
119   I am listening as I write
120   this to Mahler's 9th.
121   Mahler was always one
122   of my favorites.
123   it's possible to listen to
124   his works again and
125   again without
126   tiring of
127   them.


128   through the women, through
129   the jobs, through the horrible
130   times and the good times,
131   through deaths, through every-
132   thing, in and out of hospitals,
133   in and out of love, through the
134   decades that have gone so
135   swiftly
136   there have been so many
137   nights of listening
138   to classical music on the
139   radio.
140   almost every
141   night.

[Page 374 ]




142   I wish I could remember the name of
143   the piece I first heard in that
144   record booth
145   but it evades me.
146   for some odd reason I do
147   remember the conductor:
148   Eugene Ormandy.
149   one of the
150   finest.


151   now Mahler is in the room
152   with me
153   and the chills run up my
154   arms, reach the back
155   of my neck ...
156   it's all so unbelievably
157   splendid,
158   splendid!
159   and I can't read a note of
160   music.
161   But I have found a part of
162   the world
163   like no other part of the
164   world.


165   it gave heart to my
166   life, helped me get
167   to
168   here.


[Page 375 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  transport [from The Last Night of the Earth
        Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I was a scraggly bum most of my
2   life
3   and to get from one city to another
4   I took the buses.
5   I don't know how many times I
6   saw the Grand Canyon,
7   going east to west
8   and west to east.
9   it was just dusty windows,
10   the backs of necks, stop-offs at
11   intolerable eating places
12   and always the old
13   constipation
14   blues.
15   and once, a half-assed romance
16   with no socially redeeming
17   value.


18   then I found myself riding the
19   trains.
20   the food was beautiful
21   and the restrooms were
22   lovely
23   and I stayed in the bar
24   cars.
25   some of them were
26   so grand:
27   round curving picture
28   windows
29   and large overhead
30   domes,
31   the sun shone right on
32   down through your
33   glass
34   and at night you could
35   get
36   stinko

[Page 376 ]


37   and watch the stars and
38   the moon ride
39   right along with
40   you.
41   and the best, since there was more
42   space
43   people weren't forced
44   to speak to
45   you.


46   then after the trains I found
47   myself on the
48   jetliners,
49   quick trips to cities and
50   back.
51   I was like many of the
52   others:
53   I had a briefcase
54   and was writing on pieces
55   of paper.
56   I was on the hustle.
57   and I hustled and hounded the
58   stewardesses for drink after
59   drink.
60   the food and the view were
61   bad.
62   and the people tended to
63   talk to you
64   but there were ways to
65   discourage
66   that.
67   the worst about flying was that
68   there were people waiting for
69   you at the airports.
70   baggage was no problem:
71   you had your carry-on bag,
72   change of underwear, socks,
73   one shirt, toothbrush, razor,
74   liquor.

[Page 377 ]


75   then the jetliners stopped.
76   you stayed in the city,
77   you shacked with unsavory
78   ladies and you purchased a
79   series of old cars.
80   you were much luckier with the
81   cars than with the
82   ladies,
83   you bought the cars for a
84   song
85   and drove them with a classic
86   abandon.
87   they never needed an oil
88   change and they lasted and
89   lasted.
90   on one the springs were
91   broken.
92   on another they stuck up
93   out of the seat and into your
94   ass.
95   one had no reverse
96   gear.
97   this was good for me,
98   it was like playing a game of
99   chess---
100   keeping your King from getting
101   checkmated.
102   another would only start
103   when parked on a
104   hill.
105   there was one where the
106   lights wouldn't go on until you
107   hit a bump
108   HARD.


109   of course, they all died
110   finally.
111   and it was always a true
112   heartbreaker for me when

[Page 378 ]


113   I had to watch them towed off
114   to the junkyard.


115   another I lost when it was impounded
116   on a drunk driving
117   rap.
118   they sent me an impound bill that was
119   four times larger than the purchase
120   price
121   so I let them keep
122   it.


123   the best car I ever had was the one
124   my first wife gave me when divorcing
125   me.
126   it was two years old,
127   as old as our marriage.


128   but the last car was (and is)
129   the very best, purchased new for
130   $30,000 cash. (well, I wrote
131   them a check).
132   it has everything: air bag,
133   anti-lock brakes, everything.


134   also, 2 or 3 times a year
135   people send a limousine
136   so we can attend various
137   functions.
138   these are very nice
139   because you can drink like
140   hell and not worry about the
141   drunk tank.


142   but I'm going to bypass that
143   private plane, that private
144   boat.
145   upkeep and rental space
146   can be a real pain in the
147   butt.

[Page 379 ]


148   I'll tell you one thing, though,
149   one night not so long
150   ago
151   I had a dream that I
152   could fly.
153   I mean, just by working
154   my arms and my legs
155   I could fly through the
156   air
157   and I did.
158   there were all these people
159   on the ground,
160   they were reaching up their
161   arms and trying to pull me
162   down
163   but
164   they couldn't do
165   it.


166   I felt like pissing on
167   them.
168   they were so
169   jealous.


170   all they had to do was
171   to work their way
172   slowly up to it
173   as I had
174   done.


175   such people think
176   success grows on
177   trees.


178   you and I,
179   we know
180   better.


[Page 380 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  betrayed [from The Last Night of the Earth
        Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the big thrill
2   was being quite young and
3   reading /Of Time and the/
4   /River/
5   by Thomas Wolfe.
6   what a fat and wondrous
7   book!
8   I read it again and
9   again.


10   then a couple of decades
11   went by
12   and I read the book
13   again.


14   I disliked the poetic prose
15   right off.
16   I put the book down and
17   looked about the
18   room.


19   I felt cheated.


20   the thrill was gone.


21   I decided to leave town.


22   I was in Los Angeles.


23   two days later I was sitting on a
24   Greyhound bus
25   going to Miami.


26   and I had a pint of whiskey
27   in one pocket
28   and a paperback copy of
29   /Fathers and Sons/
30   in the
31   other.


[Page 381 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  torched-out [from The Last Night of the
        Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the worst was closing the bars at
2   2 a.m.
3   with my lady.
4   going home to get a couple hours
5   sleep,
6   then as a substitute postal carrier
7   to be on call at
8   5:30 a.m.
9   sitting there with the other
10   subs
11   along the little ledge
12   outside the magazine
13   cases.


14   too often given a route to
15   case and carry,
16   starting 15 or 20 minutes
17   late,
18   the sweat pouring down
19   your face,
20   gathering under the
21   armpits.
22   you're dizzy, sick,
23   trying to get the case
24   up, pull it down and
25   sack it for the truck to
26   pick up.


27   you worked on sheer
28   nerve,
29   reaching down into the
30   gut,
31   flailing, fighting
32   as the last minutes,
33   the last
34   seconds

[Page 382 ]


35   rushed toward
36   you.


37   then to get on the
38   route with the people
39   and the dogs,
40   to make the rounds
41   on a new
42   route,
43   making your legs
44   go,
45   making your feet
46   walk
47   as the sun baked
48   you alive,
49   you fought through
50   your first
51   round
52   with 6 or 7 more to
53   go.
54   never time for lunch,
55   you'd get a write-up
56   if you were 5 minutes
57   late.
58   a few too many write-
59   ups and you were
60   finished,
61   they moved you
62   out.


63   it was a living, a
64   deathly
65   living, to somehow
66   finish your route,
67   come in and often
68   be told
69   you were assigned
70   to the night pick-
71   up run, another
72   ball-buster.

[Page 383 ]




73   or
74   if you got out of that
75   to drive on in
76   to your place
77   to find your lady
78   already drunk,
79   dirty dishes in the
80   sink,
81   the dog unfed,
82   the flowers unwatered,
83   the bed
84   unmade,
85   the ashtrays full of
86   punched-out
87   lipstick-smeared
88   cigarettes.


89   then to get in the tub
90   with a beer.
91   you were no longer
92   young,
93   you were no longer
94   anything,
95   just worn down and
96   out
97   with your lady in the
98   other room
99   lisping inanities and
100   insanities,
101   pouring her glasses
102   of cheap
103   wine.


104   you were always going
105   to get rid of her,
106   you were working on
107   that,
108   you were caught between
109   the post office and
110   her,

[Page 384 ]


111   it was the vise of
112   death,
113   each side crushing in
114   upon you.


115   "Jesus, baby, please,
116   please, just shut up for
117   a little while ..."


118   "ah, you asshole!
119   what're you doing in
120   there, playing with
121   yourself?"


122   to come roaring out
123   of that tub, all the impossibilities
124   of that day and that life
125   corkscrewing through you
126   ripping away
127   everything.


128   out of that tub,
129   a naked, roaring rocket
130   of battered body and
131   mind:


132   "YOU GOD DAMNED WHORE,
133   WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT
134   ANYTHING?
135   SITTING THERE ON YOUR
136   DEAD ASS AND
137   SUCKING AT THE VINO!"


138   to rush into the other room,
139   looking all about,
140   the walls whirling,
141   the entire world tilting in
142   against you.

[Page 385 ]




143   "DON'T HIT ME! DON'T HIT
144   ME!
145   YOU'D HIT ME BUT YOU
146   WOULDN'T HIT A
147   MAN!"


148   "HELL NO, I WOULDN'T
149   HIT A MAN, YOU THINK
150   I'M CRAZY?"


151   to grab the bottle from
152   her,
153   to drain damn near
154   half of it.
155   to find another bottle,
156   open it,
157   pour a tall waterglass
158   full,
159   then to smash the glass
160   against a
161   wall,
162   to explode it like
163   that
164   in purple glory.


165   to find a new glass,
166   sit down and pour a
167   full one.


168   she'd be quiet
169   then.
170   we'd drink an
171   hour or so
172   like that.


173   then, to get
174   dressed,
175   cigarette dangling,
176   you are feeling somewhat
177   better.

[Page 386 ]




178   then you are moving
179   toward the
180   door.


181   "hey! where the hell
182   you going?"


183   "I'm going to the fucking
184   bar!"


185   "not without me!
186   not without me, buster!"


187   "all right, get your ass
188   into gear!"


189   to walk there together.
190   to get our stools.
191   to sit before the long mirror.
192   the mirror you always hated to
193   look into.


194   to tell the bartender,
195   "vodka 7."


196   to have her tell the bartender,
197   "scotch and water."


198   everything was far away
199   then,
200   the post office, the world,
201   the past and the
202   future.


203   to have our drinks arrive.
204   to take the first hit in the
205   dark bar.


206   life couldn't get any
207   better.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the word [from The Last Night of the Earth
        Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   there was Auden, I don't remember
2   which small room I first read him
3   in
4   and there was Spender and I don't
5   know which small room
6   either
7   and then there was Ezra
8   and I remember that room,
9   there was a torn screen
10   that the flies came through
11   and it was Los Angeles
12   and the woman said to me,
13   "Jesus Christ, you reading those
14   /Cantos/ again!"
15   she liked e. e. cummings, though,
16   she thought he was really
17   good and she was
18   right.


19   I remember when I read Turgenev,
20   though, I had just come out of the
21   drunk tank and I was living
22   alone
23   and I thought he was really a
24   subtle and funny son of a
25   bitch.


26   Hemingway I read everywhere,
27   sometimes a few times over
28   and he made me feel brave
29   and tough
30   until one day
31   it all just stopped cold for me
32   and worse than that,
33   Ernie became an
34   irritant.

[Page 388 ]




35   my Jeffers period was sometime
36   in Los Angeles, some room, some
37   job,
38   the same woman was back
39   and she said,
40   "Jesus, how can you read this
41   crap?"
42   one time when she was gone
43   I found many magazines
44   under the bed.
45   I pulled them out
46   and found that the contents were
47   all about murder
48   and it was all about women
49   who were tortured, killed,
50   dismembered and so
51   forth with the
52   lurid photos
53   in black and
54   white.
55   that stuff wasn't for
56   me.


57   my first encounter with Henry
58   Miller was via paperback
59   on a bus through Arizona.
60   he was great when he stuck
61   to reality
62   but when he got ethereal
63   when he got to philosophizing
64   he got as dry and boring as
65   the passing
66   landscape.
67   I left him in the men's crapper
68   at a hamburger
69   stop.


70   I got hold of Celine's /Journey/
71   and read it straight through
72   while in bed eating crackers.

[Page 389 ]




73   I kept reading, eating the
74   crackers and reading, reading,
75   laughing out loud,
76   thinking, at last I've met a man
77   who writes better than
78   I.
79   I finished the book and then
80   drank much water.
81   the crackers swelled up
82   inside of me
83   and I got the worst
84   god damned stomach
85   ache of my
86   life.


87   I was living with my first
88   wife.
89   she worked for the L.A.
90   Sheriff's Dept.
91   and she came in to
92   find me doubled up
93   and moaning.


94   "Oh, what happened?"


95   "I've just read the world's
96   greatest
97   writer!"


98   "But you said /you/ were."


99   "I'm second, baby ..."


100   I read F. D.'s /Notes from the/
101   /Underground/
102   in a small El Paso
103   library
104   after sleeping the night
105   on a park bench

[Page 390 ]


106   during a sand
107   storm.
108   after reading that book
109   I knew I had a long way
110   to go as a
111   writer.


112   I don't know where I read
113   T. S. Eliot.
114   he made a small dent
115   which soon ironed
116   out.


117   there were many rooms,
118   many books,
119   D. H. Lawrence, Gorky,
120   A. Huxley, Sherwood
121   Anderson, Sinclair Lewis,
122   James Thurber, Dos Passos,
123   etc
124   Kafka.
125   Schopenhauer, Nietzsche,
126   Rabelais.
127   Hamsun.


128   as a very young man
129   I worked as a shipping clerk,
130   made the bars at
131   night,
132   came into the roominghouse,
133   went to bed
134   and read the
135   books.
136   I had 3 or 4 of them in
137   bed with me (what a
138   man!) and then I would
139   sleep.


140   my landlady finally told
141   me, "You know, you read those

[Page 391 ]


142   books in bed and about every
143   hour or so one of them will
144   fall to the floor.
145   You are keeping everybody
146   awake!"


147   (I was on the 3rd floor.)


148   what days and nights those
149   were.


150   now I can't read anything,
151   not even the newspaper.
152   and, of course, I can't watch
153   tv except for the boxing
154   matches.
155   I do hear some news
156   on the car radio
157   while driving the freeway
158   and waiting for the
159   traffic
160   reports.


161   but you know, my former
162   life as a bibliophile, it
163   possibly kept me from
164   murdering somebody,
165   myself
166   included.
167   it kept me from being an
168   industrialist.
169   it allowed me to endure
170   some women
171   that most men would never
172   be able to live
173   with.
174   it gave me space, a
175   pause.

[Page 392 ]




176   it helped me to write
177   this


178   (in this room,
179   like the other rooms)


180   perhaps for some young man
181   now
182   needing
183   to laugh at the
184   impossibilities
185   which are here
186   always
187   after we are
188   not.

        Bukowski, Charles :  shooting the moon in the eye [from The Last
        Night of the Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   it was just a small room, no bathroom,
2   hot plate, bed, 2 chairs, a bed, sink,
3   phone in hall.
4   I was on the 2nd floor of a hotel.
5   I had a job.
6   I got in about 6:30 p.m.
7   and by 8 p.m.
8   there would be 4 or 5 people
9   in the room,
10   all drunks,
11   all drinking wine.
12   sometimes there would be
13   6 or 7.
14   most of them sat on the
15   bed.
16   oh, there was a radio,
17   we played the radio,
18   drank and
19   talked.


20   it was strange, there was
21   always a sense of
22   excitement there,
23   some laughter and
24   sometimes serious
25   arguments that were
26   somewhat
27   stupid.


28   we were never asked
29   to be quiet,
30   the manager never
31   bothered us,
32   or the
33   police.
34   with an exception
35   or two,

[Page 394 ]


36   there were no
37   physical
38   confrontations.
39   I'd always call an
40   end to the parties
41   around 3 a.m.


42   "ah, come on Hank!
43   we're just getting
44   started!"


45   "come on, come
46   on, everybody
47   out!"


48   and,
49   with an exception
50   or two,
51   I always slept
52   without a
53   lady.


54   we called
55   that place,
56   the Hotel from
57   Hell.


58   I had no idea
59   what we were
60   trying to
61   do.


62   I think we were
63   just celebrating
64   being
65   alive.


66   that small room
67   full of smoke and
68   music and

[Page 395 ]


69   voices,
70   night after night
71   after
72   night.


73   the poor, the mad,
74   the lost.


75   we lit up that hotel
76   with our twisted
77   souls
78   and it loved
79   us.


[Page 396 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  nirvana [from The Last Night of the Earth
        Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   not much chance,
2   completely cut loose from
3   purpose,
4   he was a young man
5   riding a bus
6   through North Carolina
7   on the way to
8   somewhere
9   and it began to snow
10   and the bus stopped
11   at a little cafe
12   in the hills
13   and the passengers
14   entered.


15   he sat at the counter
16   with the others,
17   he ordered and the
18   food arrived.
19   the meal was
20   particularly
21   good
22   and the
23   coffee.


24   the waitress was
25   unlike the women
26   he had
27   known.
28   she was unaffected,
29   there was a natural
30   humor which came
31   from her.
32   the fry cook said
33   crazy things.
34   the dishwasher,
35   in back,

[Page 397 ]


36   laughed, a good
37   clean
38   pleasant
39   laugh.


40   the young man watched
41   the snow through the
42   windows.


43   he wanted to stay
44   in that cafe
45   forever.


46   the curious feeling
47   swam through him
48   that everything
49   was
50   beautiful
51   there,
52   that it would always
53   stay beautiful
54   there.


55   then the bus driver
56   told the passengers
57   that it was time
58   to board.


59   the young man
60   thought, I'll just sit
61   here, I'll just stay
62   here.


63   but then
64   he rose and followed
65   the others into the
66   bus.


67   he found his seat
68   and looked at the cafe
69   through the bus
70   window.

[Page 398 ]




71   then the bus moved
72   off, down a curve,
73   downward, out of
74   the hills.


75   the young man
76   looked straight
77   forward.
78   he heard the other
79   passengers
80   speaking
81   of other things,
82   or they were
83   reading
84   or
85   attempting to
86   sleep.


87   they had not
88   noticed
89   the
90   magic.


91   the young man
92   put his head to
93   one side,
94   closed his
95   eyes,
96   pretended to
97   sleep.
98   there was nothing
99   else to do---
100   just listen to the
101   sound of the
102   engine,
103   the sound of the
104   tires
105   in the
106   snow.

        Bukowski, Charles :  an invitation [from The Last Night of the
        Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   hey Chinaski:
2   I am a filmmaker in the Hollywood area and
3   I am currently making a movie in which I
4   would like to include you.
5   The nature of the movie is about an
6   alcoholic Satan who decides to leave hell
7   for a while and have a vacation in
8   Hollywood.
9   This particular version of Satan is a fun
10   guy who can't get enough booze, SLUTS,
11   or adventure.
12   Satan, while in Hollywood looks up his
13   old buddies (Ghosts) Richard Burton,
14   Errol Flynn and Idi Amin (still alive).
15   He proceeds to get smashed with these
16   guys and they all pass out on him so
17   he needs to look up a mortal worthy of
18   drinking with him (YOU).
19   The scene I have envisioned with you
20   would be to be sitting around a crummy
21   joint, drinking Mezcal and playing Russian
22   Roulette with Satan while 2 big fat chicks
23   are slapping each other with Salamis.
24   I would want everybody in the scene to be
25   SMASHED.
26   I can tell you now that I couldn't pay you
27   anything up front xcept Booze and
28   adventure.
29   ---However---
30   I am going to hopefully be able to release
31   this movie one day and would be happy to
32   work out a contractual agreement that
33   would arrange a royalty rate---(if you are
34   interested.)
35   And thanks for mentioning in your
36   writing, KNUT HAMSUN.

[Page 400 ]


37   he has turned out to be one of my
38   faves.
39   And just remember,
40   WHEN IN DOUBT,
41   PASS OUT!


[Page 401 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  batting order: [from The Last Night of the
        Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   Hemingway's been in a slump,
2   can't hit a curve ball
3   anymore,
4   I'm dropping him to the 6th
5   spot.
6   I'm putting Celine in
7   cleanup,
8   he's inconsistent but when
9   he's good there's no
10   better.
11   Hamsun I'm going to use
12   in the number 3 spot,
13   he hits them hard and
14   often.
15   lead-off, well, lead-off
16   I'll use e. e. cummings,
17   he's fast, can beat out a
18   bunt.
19   I'll use Pound in the
20   number two spot, Ezra
21   is one of the better
22   hit and run men
23   in the business.
24   the 5 spot I'll give to
25   Dostoevsky,
26   he's a heavy hitter, great with
27   men on base.
28   the 7 spot I'll give to Robinson
29   Jeffers, can you think of anybody
30   better?
31   he can drill a rock
32   350 feet.
33   the 8 spot, I've got my
34   catcher, J. D. Salinger,
35   if we can find
36   him.
37   and pitching?

[Page 402 ]


38   how about Nietzsche?
39   he's strong!
40   been breaking all the tables
41   in the training
42   room.


43   coaches?


44   I'll take Kierkegaard and
45   Sartre,
46   gloomy fellows,
47   but none know this
48   game better.


49   when we field this team,
50   it's all over,
51   gentlemen.


52   we're going to kick some
53   ass, most likely
54   yours.


[Page 403 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  the open canvas [from The Last Night of the
        Earth Poems (1992) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   listening to organ music on the radio
2   tonight,
3   the door to the small balcony is
4   open,
5   it is 11:07 p.m., cold, a night of
6   silence except for the
7   radio, the
8   organ music,
9   and I get this vision
10   of a thin, tall man at the key-
11   board, he is more than pale, al-
12   most a chalky
13   white.
14   the music boils in the
15   gloom.
16   the walls about him are
17   unpainted, cold,
18   austerely
19   indifferent.


20   a full glass of wine sits
21   untouched
22   on a rough hand-made table
23   to his
24   right.


25   the music seeps through his
26   bones,
27   centuries bend and
28   unwind as the invisible dog
29   of darkness
30   walks by
31   in a half circle
32   behind him,
33   then blends into
34   neurons.

[Page 404 ]




35   the man continues to
36   play.
37   the world turns upsidedown
38   with a fixed gentleness
39   but the walls, the man,
40   the sounds continue
41   as before.


42   then the world returns to its
43   natural course.


44   one tonality breeds
45   another.
46   the sounds of black strings
47   of beads.
48   the sound is one
49   yet not one.


50   then the music
51   stops.


52   the man sits.


53   he is thoughtless.


54   the keys of the organ assume
55   an immensity.


56   the walls about him move away
57   faster than the eye
58   can note,
59   then they
60   return.


61   the man coughs, looks to
62   his left,
63   looks down,
64   touches the keys and
65   is taken
66   again.


[Page 405 ]

1   branching out, grubbing down,
2   taking stairways down to hell,
3   reestablishing the vanishing
4   point, trying a different
5   bat, a different stance, alter-
6   ing diet and manner of
7   walking, readjusting the
8   system, photographing your
9   dinosaur dream,
10   driving your machine with
11   more grace and care,
12   noticing the flowers talking
13   to you,
14   realizing the gigantic agony
15   of the terrapin,
16   you pray for rain like an
17   Indian,
18   slide a fresh clip into the
19   automatic,
20   turn out the lights and
21   wait.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /Sandra/ [from Love is a Dog from Hell:
        Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   is the slim tall
2   ear-ringed
3   bedroom damsel
4   dressed in a long
5   gown


6   she's always high
7   in heels
8   spirit
9   pills
10   booze


11   Sandra leans out of
12   her chair
13   /leans/ toward
14   Glendale


15   I wait for her head
16   to hit the closet
17   doorknob
18   as she attempts to
19   light
20   a new cigarette on an
21   almost burnt-out
22   one


23   at 32 she likes
24   young neat
25   unscratched boys
26   with faces like the bottoms
27   of new saucers


28   she has proclaimed as much
29   to me
30   has brought her prizes

[Page 16 ]


31   over for me to view:
32   silent blonde zeros of young
33   flesh
34   who
35   a) sit
36   b) stand
37   c) talk
38   at her command


39   sometimes she brings one
40   sometimes two
41   sometimes three
42   for me to
43   view


44   Sandra looks very good in
45   long gowns
46   Sandra could probably break
47   a man's heart


48   I hope she finds
49   one.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /you/ [from Love is a Dog from Hell: Poems,
        1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   you're a beast, she said
2   your big white belly
3   and those hairy feet.
4   you never cut your nails
5   and you have fat hands
6   paws like a cat
7   your bright red nose
8   and the biggest balls
9   I've ever seen.
10   you shoot sperm like a
11   whale shoots water out of the
12   hole in its back.


13   beast beast beast,
14   she kissed me,
15   what do you want for
16   breakfast?

        Bukowski, Charles :  /the 6 foot goddess/ [from Love is a Dog
        from Hell: Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I'm big
2   I suppose that's why my women always seem
3   small
4   but this 6 foot goddess
5   who deals in real estate
6   and art
7   and flies from Texas
8   to see me
9   and I fly to Texas
10   to see her---
11   well, there's plenty of her to
12   grab hold of
13   and I grab hold of it
14   of her,
15   I yank her head back by the hair,
16   I'm real macho,
17   I suck on her upper lip
18   her cunt
19   her soul
20   I mount her and tell her,
21   "I'm going to shoot white hot
22   juice into you. I didn't fly all the
23   way to Galveston to play
24   chess."


25   later we lay locked like human vines
26   my left arm under her pillow
27   my right arm over her side
28   I grip both of her hands,
29   and my chest
30   belly
31   balls
32   cock
33   tangle into her
34   and through us

[Page 19 ]


35   in the dark
36   pass rays
37   back and forth
38   back and forth
39   until I fall away
40   and we sleep.


41   she's wild
42   but kind
43   my 6 foot goddess
44   makes me laugh
45   the laughter of the mutilated
46   who still need
47   love,
48   and her blessed eyes
49   run deep into her head
50   like mountain springs
51   far in
52   and
53   cool and good.


54   she has saved me
55   from everything that is
56   not here.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /I've seen too many glazed-eyed bums
        sitting under a bridge drinking cheap wine/ [from Love is a Dog
        from Hell: Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   you sit on the couch
2   with me
3   tonight
4   new woman.


5   have you seen the
6   animal-eater
7   documentaries?


8   they show death.


9   and now I wonder
10   which animal of
11   us will eat the
12   other first
13   physically and
14   last
15   spiritually?


16   we consume animals
17   and then one of us
18   consumes the other,
19   my love.


20   meanwhile
21   I'd prefer you go
22   first the first way


23   since if past performance
24   charts mean anything
25   I'll surely go
26   first the last
27   way.


[Page 21 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  /sexpot/ [from Love is a Dog from Hell:
        Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   "you know," she said, "you were at
2   the bar so you didn't see
3   but I danced with this guy.
4   we danced and we danced
5   close.
6   but I didn't go home with him
7   because he knew I was with
8   you."


9   "thanks a bunch," I
10   said.


11   she was always thinking of sex.
12   she carried it around with her
13   like something in a paper
14   bag.
15   such energy.
16   she never forgot.
17   she stared at every man available
18   in morning cafes
19   over bacon and eggs
20   or later
21   over a noon sandwich or
22   a steak dinner.


23   "I've modeled myself after
24   Marilyn Monroe," she told
25   me.


26   "she's always running off
27   to some local disco to dance
28   with a baboon," a friend once told
29   me, "I'm amazed that you've
30   stood for it as long as you have."

[Page 22 ]




31   she'd vanish at racetracks
32   then come back and say,
33   "three men offered to buy me
34   a drink."


35   or I'd lose her in the parking
36   lot and I'd look up and she'd
37   be walking along with a strange man.
38   "well, he came from this direction
39   and I came from that and we
40   kind of walked together. I
41   didn't want to hurt his
42   feelings."


43   she said that I was a very
44   jealous man.


45   one day she just
46   fell down
47   inside of her sexual organs
48   and vanished.


49   it was like an alarm clock
50   dropping into the
51   Grand Canyon.
52   it banged and rattled and
53   rang and rang
54   but I could no longer
55   see or hear it.


56   I'm feeling much better
57   now.
58   I've taken up tap-dancing
59   and I wear a black felt
60   hat pulled down low
61   over my right
62   eye.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /sweet music/ [from Love is a Dog from
        Hell: Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   it beats love because there aren't any
2   wounds: in the morning
3   she turns on the radio, Brahms or Ives
4   or Stravinsky or Mozart. she boils the
5   eggs counting the seconds out loud: 56,
6   57, 58 ... she peels the eggs, brings
7   them to me in bed. after breakfast it's
8   the same chair and listen to the class-
9   ical music. she's on her first glass of
10   scotch and her third cigarette. I tell
11   her I must go to the racetrack. she's
12   been here about 2 nights and 2 days. "when
13   will I see you again?" I ask. she
14   suggests that might be up to me. I
15   nod and Mozart plays.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /numb your ass and your brain and your
        heart/ --- [from Love is a Dog from Hell: Poems, 1974-1977
        (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   I was coming off an affair that had gone badly.
2   frankly, I was sliding down into a pit
3   really feeling shitty and low
4   when I lucked into this lady with a large bed
5   covered with a jeweled canopy
6   plus
7   wine, champagne, smokes, pills and
8   color tv.
9   we stayed in bed and
10   drank wine, champagne, smoked, popped pills
11   by the dozens
12   as I (feeling shitty and low)
13   tried to get over this affair that had gone
14   bad.
15   I watched the tv trying to dull my senses,
16   but the thing that really helped
17   was this very long
18   (specially written for tv) drama about
19   spies---
20   American spies and Russian spies, and
21   they were all so clever and
22   cool---
23   even their children didn't know
24   their wives didn't know, and
25   in a way
26   /they/ hardly knew---
27   and I found out about counter-spies, double-spies:
28   guys who worked both sides, and
29   then this one who was a double-spy turned
30   into a triple-spy, it
31   got nicely confusing---
32   I don't even think the guy who wrote the script
33   knew what was happening---
34   it went on for hours!

[Page 25 ]


35   seaplanes rammed into icebergs,
36   a priest in Madison, Wisc. murdered his brother,
37   a block of ice was shipped in a casket to Peru
38   in lieu of the world's largest diamond, and
39   blondes walked in and out of rooms eating
40   creampuffs and walnuts;
41   the triple-spy turned into a
42   quadruple-spy and everybody loved
43   everybody
44   and it went on and on
45   and the hours passed and
46   it all finally vanished like a paperclip in a
47   bag of trash and I
48   reached over and flicked off the set and
49   slept well for the first time
50   in a week and a half.


[Page 26 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  /one of the hottest/ [from Love is a Dog
        from Hell: Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   she wore a platinum blond wig
2   and her face was rouged and powdered
3   and she put the lipstick on
4   making a huge painted mouth
5   and her neck was wrinkled
6   but she still had the ass of a young girl
7   and the legs were good.
8   she wore blue panties and I got them off
9   raised her dress, and with the TV flickering
10   I took her standing up.
11   as we struggled around the room
12   (I'm fucking the grave, I thought, I'm
13   bringing the dead back to life, marvelous
14   so marvelous
15   like eating cold olives at 3 a.m.
16   with half the town on fire)
17   I came.


18   you boys can keep your virgins
19   give me hot old women in high heels
20   with asses that forgot to get old.


21   of course, you leave afterwards
22   or get very drunk
23   which is the same
24   thing.


25   we drank wine for hours and watched tv
26   and when we went to bed
27   to sleep it off
28   she left her teeth in all
29   night long.


[Page 27 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  /ashes/ [from Love is a Dog from Hell:
        Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I got his ashes, she said, and I took them
2   out to sea and I scattered his ashes and
3   they didn't even look like ashes
4   and
5   the urn was weighted with
6   green and blue pebbles ...


7   he didn't leave you any of his
8   millions?


9   nothing, she said.


10   after having to eat all those breakfasts
11   and lunches and dinners with him? after
12   listening to all his bullshit?


13   he was a brilliant man.


14   you know what I mean.


15   anyhow, I got the ashes. and you fucked
16   my sisters.


17   I never fucked your sisters.


18   yes, you did.


19   I fucked one of them.


20   which one?


21   the lesbian, I said, she bought me dinner and drinks,
22   I had very little choice.


23   I'm going, she said.

[Page 28 ]




24   don't forget your bottle.


25   she went in and got it.


26   there's so little to you, she said, that when you die and
27   they burn you they'll have to add almost all green and
28   blue pebbles.


29   all right, I said.


30   I'll see you in 6 months! she screamed and slammed the door.


31   well, I thought, I guess in order to get rid of her I'll have
32   to fuck her other sister. I walked into the bedroom and started
33   looking for phone numbers. all I remembered was that she
34   lived in San Mateo and had a very good
35   job.


[Page 29 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  /fuck/ [from Love is a Dog from Hell:
        Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   she pulled her dress off
2   over her head
3   and I saw the panties
4   indented somewhat into the
5   crotch.


6   it's only human.
7   now we've got to do it.
8   I've got to do it
9   after all that bluff.
10   it's like a party---
11   two trapped
12   idiots.


13   under the sheets
14   after I have snapped
15   off the light
16   her panties are still
17   on. she expects an
18   opening performance.
19   I can't blame her. but
20   wonder why she's here with
21   me? where are the other
22   guys? how can you be
23   lucky? having someone the
24   others have abandoned?


25   we didn't have to do it
26   yet we had to do it.
27   it was something like
28   establishing new credibility
29   with the income tax
30   man. I get the panties
31   off. I decide not to
32   tongue her. even then

[Page 30 ]


33   I'm thinking about
34   after it's over.


35   we'll sleep together
36   tonight
37   trying to fit ourselves
38   inside the wallpaper.


39   I try, fail,
40   notice the hair on her
41   head
42   mostly notice the hair
43   on her
44   head
45   and a glimpse of
46   nostrils
47   piglike


48   I try it
49   again.


[Page 31 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  /me/ [from Love is a Dog from Hell: Poems,
        1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   women don't know how to love,
2   she told me.
3   you know how to love
4   but women just want to
5   leech.
6   I know this because I'm a
7   woman.


8   hahaha, I laughed.


9   so don't worry about your breakup
10   with Susan
11   because she'll just leech onto
12   somebody else.


13   we talked a while longer
14   then I said goodbye
15   hungup
16   went into the crapper and
17   took a good beershit
18   mainly thinking, well,
19   I'm still alive
20   and have the ability to expell
21   wastes from my body.
22   and poems.
23   and as long as that's happening
24   I have the ability to handle
25   betrayal
26   loneliness
27   hangnail
28   clap
29   and the economic reports in the
30   financial section.


31   with that

[Page 32 ]


32   I stood up
33   wiped
34   flushed
35   then thought:
36   it's true:
37   I know how to
38   love.


39   I pulled up my pants and walked
40   into the other room.


[Page 33 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  /another bed/ [from Love is a Dog from
        Hell: Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   another bed
2   another woman


3   more curtains
4   another bathroom
5   another kitchen


6   other eyes
7   other hair
8   other
9   feet and toes.


10   everybody's looking.
11   the eternal search.


12   you stay in bed
13   she gets dressed for work
14   and you wonder what happened
15   to the last one
16   and the one before that ...
17   it's all so comfortable---
18   this love-making
19   this sleeping together
20   the gentle kindness ...


21   after she leaves you get up and use her
22   bathroom,
23   it's all so intimate and so strange.
24   you go back to bed and
25   sleep another hour.


26   when you leave it's with sadness
27   but you'll see her again
28   whether it works or not.

[Page 34 ]




29   you drive down to the shore and sit
30   in your car. it's almost noon.


31   ---another bed, other ears, other
32   ear rings, other mouths, other slippers, other
33   dresses
34   colors, doors, phone numbers.


35   you were once strong enough to live alone.
36   for a man nearing sixty you should be more
37   sensible.


38   you start the car and shift,
39   thinking, I'll phone Jeanie when I get in,
40   I haven't seen her since Friday.


[Page 35 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  /trapped/ [from Love is a Dog from Hell:
        Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   don't undress my love
2   you might find a mannequin;
3   don't undress the mannequin
4   you might find
5   my love.


6   she's long ago
7   forgotten me.


8   she's trying on a new
9   hat
10   and looks more the
11   coquette
12   than ever.


13   she is a
14   child
15   and a mannequin
16   and
17   death.


18   I can't hate
19   that.


20   she didn't do
21   anything

1   "your poems about the girls will still be around
2   50 years from now when the girls are gone,"
3   my editor phones me.


4   dear editor:
5   the girls appear to be gone
6   already.


7   I know what you mean


8   but give me one truly alive woman
9   tonight
10   walking across the floor toward me


11   and you can have all the poems


12   the good ones
13   the bad ones
14   or any that I might write
15   after this one.


16   I know what you mean.


17   do you know what I mean?

        Bukowski, Charles :  /the escape/ [from Love is a Dog from Hell:
        Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   escape from the black widow spider
2   is a miracle as great as art.
3   what a web she can weave
4   slowly drawing you to her
5   she'll embrace you
6   then when she's satisfied
7   she'll kill you
8   still in her embrace
9   and suck the blood from you.


10   I escaped my black widow
11   because she had too many males
12   in her web
13   and while she was embracing one
14   and then the other and then
15   another
16   I worked free
17   got out
18   to where I was before.


19   she'll miss me---
20   not my love
21   but the taste of my blood,
22   but she's good, she'll find other
23   blood;
24   she's so good that I almost miss my death,
25   but not quite;
26   I've escaped. I view the other
27   webs.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /the drill/ [from Love is a Dog from Hell:
        Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   our marriage book, it
2   says.
3   I look through it.
4   they lasted ten years.
5   they were young once.
6   now I sleep in her bed.
7   he phones her:
8   "I want my drill back.
9   have it ready.
10   I'll pick the children up at
11   ten."
12   when he arrives he waits outside
13   the door.
14   his children leave with
15   him.
16   she comes back to bed
17   and I stretch a leg out
18   place it against hers.
19   I was young once too.
20   human relationships simply aren't
21   durable.
22   I think back to the women in
23   my life.
24   they seem non-existent.


25   "did he get his drill?" I ask.


26   "yes, he got his drill."


27   I wonder if I'll ever have to come
28   back for my bermuda
29   shorts and my record album
30   by The Academy of St. Martin in the
31   Fields? I suppose I
32   will.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /texan/ [from Love is a Dog from Hell:
        Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   she's from Texas and weighs
2   103 pounds
3   and stands before the
4   mirror combing oceans
5   of reddish hair
6   which falls all the way down
7   her back to her ass.
8   the hair is magic and shoots
9   sparks as I lay on the bed
10   and watch her combing her
11   hair. she's like something
12   out of the movies but she's
13   actually here. we make love
14   at least once a day and
15   she can make me laugh
16   any time she cares
17   to. Texas women are always
18   healthy, and besides that she's
19   cleaned my refrigerator, my sink,
20   the bathroom, and she cooks and
21   feeds me healthy foods
22   and washes the dishes
23   too.


24   "Hank," she told me,
25   holding up a can of grapefruit
26   juice, "this is the best of them
27   all."
28   it says: Texas unsweetened
29   PINK grapefruit juice.


30   she looks like Katherine Hepburn
31   looked when she was
32   in high school, and I watch those
33   103 pounds

[Page 40 ]


34   combing a yard and some change
35   of reddish hair
36   before the mirror
37   and I feel her inside of my
38   wrists and at the backs of my eyes,
39   and the toes and legs and belly
40   of me feel her and
41   the other part too,
42   and all of Los Angeles falls down
43   and weeps for joy,
44   the walls of the love parlors shake---
45   the ocean rushes in and she turns
46   to me and says, "damn this hair!"
47   and I say,
48   "yes."

        Bukowski, Charles :  /the spider/ [from Love is a Dog from Hell:
        Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   then there was the time in
2   New Orleans
3   I was living with a fat woman,
4   Marie, in the French Quarter
5   and I got very sick.
6   while she was at work
7   I got down on my knees
8   in the kitchen
9   that afternoon and
10   prayed. I was not a
11   religious man
12   but it was a very dark afternoon
13   and I prayed:
14   "Dear God: if you will let me live,
15   I promise You I'll never take
16   another drink."
17   I kneeled there and it was just like
18   a movie---
19   as I finished praying
20   the clouds parted and the sun came
21   through the curtains
22   and fell upon me.
23   then I got up and took a crap.
24   there was a big spider in Marie's bathroom
25   but I crapped anyhow.
26   an hour later I began feeling much
27   better. I took a walk around the Quarter
28   and smiled at people.
29   I stopped at the grocery and got a couple of
30   6 packs for Marie.
31   I began feeling so good that an hour later
32   I sat in the kitchen and opened
33   one of the beers.
34   I drank that and then another one
35   and then I went in and

[Page 42 ]


36   killed the spider.
37   when Marie got home from work
38   I gave her a big kiss,
39   then sat in the kitchen and talked
40   as she cooked dinner.
41   she asked me what had happened that day
42   and I told her I had killed the
43   spider. she didn't get
44   angry. she was a good
45   sort.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /the end of a short affair/ [from Love is a
        Dog from Hell: Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I tried it standing up
2   this time.
3   it doesn't usually
4   work.
5   this time it seemed
6   to ...


7   she kept saying
8   "o my God, you've got
9   beautiful legs!"


10   it was all right
11   until she took her feet
12   off the ground
13   and wrapped her legs
14   around my middle.


15   "o my God, you've got
16   beautiful legs!"


17   she weighed about 138
18   pounds and hung there as I
19   worked.


20   it was when I climaxed
21   that I felt the pain
22   fly straight up my
23   spine.


24   I dropped her on the
25   couch and walked around
26   the room.
27   the pain remained.


28   "look," I told her,
29   "you better go. I've got

[Page 44 ]


30   to develop some film
31   in my dark room."


32   she dressed and left
33   and I walked into the
34   kitchen for a glass of
35   water. I got a glass full
36   in my left hand.
37   the pain ran up behind my
38   ears and
39   I dropped the glass
40   which broke on the floor.


41   I got into a tub full of
42   hot water and epsom salts.
43   I just got stretched out
44   when the phone rang.
45   as I tried to straighten
46   my back
47   the pain extended to my
48   neck and arms.
49   I flopped about
50   gripped the sides of the tub
51   got out
52   with shots of green and yellow
53   and red light
54   flashing in my head.


55   the phone kept ringing.
56   I picked it up.
57   "hello?"


58   "I LOVE YOU!" she said.


59   "thanks," I said.


60   "is that all you've got
61   to say?"

[Page 45 ]




62   "yes."


63   "eat shit!" she said and
64   hung up.


65   love dries up, I thought
66   as I walked back to the
67   bathroom, even faster
68   than sperm.

2   be moaning and groan-

4   about how I fucked
5   those 2 guys last week.
6   I know you.
7   she writes on to

10   she had just fucked
11   a third guy
12   but she knows I don't
13   want to hear who, why
14   or how. she closes her
15   letter, "Love."


16   rats and roaches
17   have triumphed again.
18   here it comes running
19   with a slug in its
20   mouth, it's singing
21   old love songs.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /an almost made up poem/ [from Love is a
        Dog from Hell: Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   I see you drinking at a fountain with tiny
2   blue hands, no, your hands are not tiny
3   they are small, and the fountain is in France
4   where you wrote me that last letter and
5   I answered and never heard from you again.
6   you used to write insane poems about
7   ANGELS AND GOD, all in upper case, and you
8   knew famous artists and most of them
9   were your lovers, and I wrote back, it's all right,
10   go ahead, enter their lives, I'm not jealous
11   because we've never met. we got close once in
12   New Orleans, one half block, but never met, never
13   touched. so you went with the famous and wrote
14   about the famous, and, of course, what you found out
15   is that the famous are worried about
16   their fame---not the beautiful young girl in bed
17   with them, who gives them /that/ , and then awakens
18   in the morning to write upper case poems about
19   ANGELS AND GOD. we know God is dead, they've told
20   us, but listening to you I wasn't sure. maybe
21   it was the upper case. you were one of the
22   best female poets and I told the publishers,
23   editors, "print her, print her, she's mad but she's
24   magic. there's no lie in her fire." I loved you
25   like a man loves a woman he never touches, only
26   writes to, keeps little photographs of. I would have
27   loved you more if I had sat in a small room rolling a
28   cigarette and listened to you piss in the bathroom,
29   but that didn't happen. your letters got sadder.
30   your lovers betrayed you. kid, I wrote back, all
31   lovers betray. it didn't help. you said
32   you had a crying bench and it was by a bridge and
33   the bridge was over a river and you sat on the crying
34   bench every night and wept for the lovers who had
35   hurt and forgotten you. I wrote back but never

[Page 48 ]


36   heard again. a friend wrote me of your suicide
37   3 or 4 months after it happened. if I had met you
38   I would probably have been unfair to you or you
39   to me. it was best like this.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /blue cheese and chili peppers/ [from Love

1   these women are supposed to come
2   and see me
3   but they never
4   do.
5   there's the one with the long scar along her
6   belly.
7   there's the other who writes poems
8   and phones at 3 a.m., saying,
9   "I love you."
10   there's the one who dances with a
11   boa constrictor
12   and writes every four
13   weeks, she'll
14   come, she says.
15   and the 4th who claims she sleeps
16   always
17   with my latest book
18   under her
19   pillow.


20   I whack-off in the heat
21   and listen to Brahms and eat
22   blue cheese with chili
23   peppers.


24   these are women of good mind and
25   body, excellent in or out of bed,
26   dangerous and deadly, of
27   course---
28   but why do they all have to live
29   up north?


30   I know that someday they'll
31   arrive, but two or three
32   on the same day, and

[Page 50 ]


33   we'll sit around and talk
34   and then they'll all leave
35   together.


36   somebody else will have them
37   and I will walk about
38   in my floppy shorts
39   smoking too many cigarettes
40   and trying to make drama
41   out of
42   no damned progress
43   at all.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /problems about the other woman/ [from Love
        is a Dog from Hell: Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I had worked my charms on her
2   for a couple of nights in a bar---
3   not that we were new lovers,
4   I had loved her for 16 months
5   but she didn't want to come to my place
6   "because that other woman has been there,"
7   and I said, "all right, all right, what will we do?"


8   she had come in from the north and was looking for a
9   place to stay
10   meanwhile rooming with her girlfriend,
11   and she went to her rent-a-trailer
12   and got out some blankets and said,
13   "let's go to the park."
14   I told her she was crazy
15   the cops would get us
16   but she said, "no, it's nice and foggy,"
17   so we went to the park
18   spread out the equipment and began
19   working and here came headlights---
20   a squad car---
21   she said, "hurry, get your pants on! I've got mine
22   on!"
23   I said, "I can't. they're all twisted-up."
24   and they came with flashlights
25   and asked what we were doing and she said,
26   "kissing!" one of the cops looked at me and
27   said, "I don't blame you," and after some small
28   talk they left us alone.
29   but she still didn't want the bed where that woman
30   had been,
31   so we ended up in a dark hot motel room
32   sweating and kissing and working
33   but we made it all right; but I mean,
34   after all that suffering ...

[Page 52 ]




35   we were at my place finally
36   that next afternoon
37   doing the same thing.


38   those weren't bad cops though
39   that night in the park---
40   and it's the first time I ever said that
41   about cops,
42   and,
43   I hope,
44   the last time I ever have
45   to.

1   she lived in Galveston and was into
2   T.M.
3   and I went down to visit her and we made love
4   continually even though it was very warm
5   weather
6   and we took mescalin
7   and we took the ferry to the island
8   and drove 200 miles to the nearest
9   racetrack.
10   we both won and sat in a redneck bar---
11   disliked and distrusted by the natives---
12   and then we went to a redneck motel
13   and came back a day or two later
14   and I stayed another week
15   painted her a couple of good paintings---
16   one of a man being hanged
17   and another of a woman being fucked by a wolf.
18   I awakened one night and she wasn't in bed
19   and I got up and walked around saying,
20   "Gloria, Gloria, where are you?"
21   it was a large place and I walked around
22   opening door after door,
23   and then I opened what looked like a closet door
24   and there she was on her knees
25   surrounded by photographs of
26   7 or 8 men
27   heads shaved
28   most of them wearing rimless spectacles.
29   there was a small candle burning
30   and I said, "oh, I'm sorry."
31   Gloria was dressed in a kimono with flying
32   eagles on the back of it.
33   I closed the door and went back to bed.
34   she came out in 15 minutes.
35   we began kissing,
36   her large tongue sliding in and out of my

[Page 54 ]


37   mouth.
38   she was a large healthy Texas girl.
39   "listen, Gloria," I finally managed to say,
40   "I need a night off."


41   the next day she drove me to the airport.
42   I promised to write. she promised to write.
43   neither of us has written.

1   I heard it first while screwing a blonde
2   who had the biggest box in
3   Scranton.


4   I listened to it again as I wrote a letter
5   to my mother
6   asking for 5,000 dollars
7   and she mailed back
8   3 bottletops and
9   the stems of grandpop's
10   forefingers.


11   The 5th will kill you
12   in the grass or at the track,
13   the kitten said,
14   walking across the popinjay
15   rug.


16   if the 5th don't kill you
17   the tenth will,
18   said the Caliente hooker.
19   as they ran up the
20   beautiful catsup red flag
21   93 thieves wept in the
22   purple dust.


23   the 5th is like an
24   ant in a breakfastnook full of
25   swaggersticks and
26   june bugs
27   sucking
28   dawn's orange juice coming.


29   and I took the 3 bottletops from my
30   mother and

[Page 56 ]


31   ate them
32   wrapped in pages from
33   Cosmopolitan
34   magazine.


35   but I /am/ tired of the
36   5th
37   and I told this to a woman in
38   Ohio once, I
39   had just packed coal up 3 flights
40   of stairs
41   I was drunk and
42   dizzy, and she said:


43   how can you say you don't care
44   for something greater than you'll
45   ever be?


46   and I said:


47   that's easy.


48   and she sat in a green chair and
49   I sat in a red chair
50   and after that
51   we never made love
52   again.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /103 degrees/ [from Love is a Dog from
        Hell: Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   she cut my toenails the night before,
2   and in the morning she said, "I think I'll
3   just lay here all day."
4   which meant she wasn't going to work.
5   she was at my apartment---which meant another
6   day and another night.
7   she was a good person
8   but she had just told me that she wanted to
9   have a child, wanted marriage, and
10   it was 103 degrees outside.
11   when I thought of /another/ child and
12   /another/ marriage
13   I really began to feel bad.
14   I had resigned myself to dying alone
15   in a small room---
16   now she was trying to reshape my master plan.
17   besides she always slammed my car door too loud
18   and ate with her head too close to the table.
19   this day we had gone to the post office, a department
20   store and then to a sandwich place for lunch.
21   I already felt married. driving back in I almost
22   ran into a Cadillac.
23   "let's get drunk," I said.
24   "no, no," she answered, "it's too early."
25   and then she slammed the car door.
26   it was still 103 degrees.
27   when I opened my mail I found my auto insurance
28   company wanted $76 more.
29   suddenly she ran into the room and screamed, "LOOK, I'M
30   TURNING RED! ALL BLOTCHY! WHAT'LL I DO!"
31   "take a bath," I told her.
32   I dialed the insurance company long distance and
33   demanded to know why.
34   she began screaming and moaning from the
35   bathtub and I couldn't hear and I said, "just a

[Page 58 ]


36   moment, please!"
37   I covered the phone and screamed at her in the bathtub:
38   "LOOK! I'M ON LONG DISTANCE! HOLD IT DOWN, FOR CHRIST'S
39   SAKE!"
40   the insurance people still maintained that I owed them
41   $76 and would send me a letter explaining why.
42   I hung up and stretched out on the bed.
43   I was already married, I felt married.
44   she came out of the bathroom and said, "can I stretch out
45   beside you?"
46   and I said, "o.k."
47   in ten minutes her color was normal.
48   it was because she had taken a niacin tablet.
49   she remembered that it happened every time.
50   we stretched out there sweating:
51   nerves. nobody has soul enough to overcome nerves.
52   but I couldn't tell her that.
53   she wanted her baby.
54   what the fuck.

1   you go for these wenches, she said,
2   you go for these whores,
3   I'll bore you.


4   I don't want to be shit on anymore,
5   I said,
6   relax.


7   when I drink, she said, it hurts my
8   bladder, it burns.


9   I'll do the drinking, I said.


10   you're waiting for the phone to ring,
11   she said,
12   you keep looking at the phone.
13   if one of those wenches phones you'll
14   run right out of here.


15   I can't promise you anything, I said.


16   then---just like that---the phone rang.


17   this is Madge, said the phone. I've
18   got to see you right away.


19   oh, I said.


20   I'm in a jam, she continued, I need ten
21   bucks---fast.


22   I'll be right over, I said, and
23   hung up.


24   she looked at me. it was a wench,
25   she said, your whole face lit up.

[Page 60 ]




26   what the hell's the matter with
27   you?


28   listen, I said, I've got to leave.
29   you stay here. I'll be right back.


30   I'm going, she said. I love you but you're
31   crazy, you're doomed.


32   she got her purse and slammed the door.


33   it's probably some deeply-rooted childhood fuckup
34   that makes me vulnerable, I thought.


35   then I left my place and got into my volks.
36   I drove north up Western with the radio on.
37   there were whores walking up and down
38   both sides of the street and Madge looked
39   more vicious than any of them.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /225 pounds/ [from Love is a Dog from Hell:

1   we were in bed and
2   she started to fight:
3   "you son of a bitch! you just wait a minute,
4   I'll get you!"


5   I began laughing:
6   "what's the matter? what's the matter?"


7   "you son of a bitch!" she screamed.


8   I held her hands as she squirmed.


9   she was a couple of decades younger than I
10   a health food freak.
11   she was /very/ strong.


12   "you son of a bitch! I'll get you!"
13   she screamed.


14   I rolled on top of her with my 225 pounds and
15   just layed it there on her.


16   "uugg, oooo, my God, that's not /fair/ , oooo, my
17   God!"


18   I rolled off and walked into the other room and
19   sat on the couch.


20   "I'll get you, bastard," she said, "you just
21   wait!"


22   "just don't bite it off," I said, "or you'll make
23   a half dozen women very unhappy."


24   she climbed up on the headboard of my bed
25   (it did have a flat though narrow surface)

[Page 62 ]


26   and sat perched there watching the news on
27   tv.
28   the tv faced the bedroom and it illuminated
29   her as she sat up there on the
30   headboard.


31   "I thought you were sane," I said, "but you're
32   just as crazy as the rest of them."


33   "be quiet," she said, "I want to watch the
34   news!"


35   "look," I said, "I'll ..."


36   "SHUSH!" she said.


37   and there she was up on the headboard of my bed
38   really watching the news. I accepted her that
39   way.

1   she drives into the parking lot while
2   I am leaning up against the fender of my car.
3   she's drunk and her eyes are wet with tears:
4   "you son of a bitch, you fucked me when you
5   didn't want to. you told me to keep phoning
6   you, you told me to move closer into town,
7   then you told me to leave you alone."


8   it's all quite dramatic and I enjoy it.
9   "sure, well, what do you want?"


10   "I want to talk to you, I want to go to your
11   place and talk to you ..."


12   "I'm with somebody now. she's in getting a
13   sandwich."


14   "I want to talk to you ... it takes a while
15   to get over things. I need more time."


16   "sure. wait until she comes out. we're not
17   inhuman. we'll all have a drink together."


18   "shit," she says, "oh shit!"


19   she jumps into her car and drives off.


20   the other one comes out: "who was that?"


21   "an ex-friend."



22   now /she's/ gone and I'm sitting here drunk
23   and my eyes seem wet with tears.

[Page 64 ]




24   it's very quiet and I feel like I have a spear
25   rammed into the center of my gut.


26   I walk to the bathroom and puke.


27   mercy, I think, doesn't the human race know anything
28   about mercy?

        Bukowski, Charles :  /one for old snaggle-tooth/ [from Love is a
        Dog from Hell: Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I know a woman
2   who keeps buying puzzles
3   chinese
4   puzzles
5   blocks
6   wires
7   pieces that finally fit
8   into some order.
9   she works it out
10   mathematically
11   she solves all her
12   puzzles
13   lives down by the sea
14   puts sugar out for the ants
15   and believes
16   ultimately
17   in a better world.
18   her hair is white
19   she seldom combs it
20   her teeth are snaggled
21   and she wears loose shapeless
22   coveralls over a body most
23   women would wish they had.
24   for many years she irritated me
25   with what I considered her
26   eccentricities---
27   like soaking eggshells in water
28   (to feed the plants so that
29   they'd get calcium).
30   but finally when I think of her
31   life
32   and compare it to other lives
33   more dazzling, original
34   and beautiful
35   I realize that she has hurt fewer

[Page 66 ]


36   people than anybody I know
37   (and by hurt I simply mean hurt).
38   she has had some terrible times,
39   times when maybe I should have
40   helped her more
41   for she is the mother of my only
42   child
43   and we were once great lovers,
44   but she has come through
45   like I said
46   she has hurt fewer people than
47   anybody I know,
48   and if you look at it like that,
49   well,
50   she has created a better world.
51   she has won.


52   Frances, this poem is for
53   you.

37   and when the spider comes out
38   and looks at you

        Bukowski, Charles :  /trying to get even:/ [from Love is a Dog
        from Hell: Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   we'd had any number of joints and some
2   beer and I was on the bed stretched out
3   and she said, "look, I've had 3 abortions
4   in a row, real fast, and I'm sick of
5   abortions, I don't want you to stick that
6   thing in me!"


7   it was sticking up there and we were both
8   looking at it.
9   "ah, come on," I said, "my girlfriend fucked
10   2 different guys this week and I'm trying to
11   get even."


12   "don't get me involved in your domestic
13   horseshit! now what I want you to do is
14   to BEAT that thing OFF while I WATCH!
15   I want to WATCH while you beat that thing
16   OFF! I want to see it shoot JUICE!"


17   "o.k. get your face closer."


18   she got it closer and I spit on my palm
19   and began working.


20   it got bigger. just before I was ready I
21   stopped, I held it at the bottom
22   stretching it,
23   the head throbbed
24   purple and shiny.


25   "oooh," she said.
26   she ducked her mouth over it, sucked at
27   it and
28   pulled away.


29   "finish it off," I said.

[Page 70 ]




30   "no!"


31   I whacked away and then stopped again
32   at the last moment and held it at the
33   bottom and waved it all around the
34   bedroom.


35   she eyed it
36   fell upon it again
37   sucked
38   and pulled away.


39   we alternated the process
40   back and forth


41   again and again.


42   finally I just pulled her off
43   the chair
44   onto the bed
45   rolled on top of her
46   stuck it in
47   worked it
48   worked it
49   and came.


50   when she walked back out of
51   the bathroom she said,
52   "you son of a bitch, I love you,
53   I've loved you for a long time.
54   when I get back to Santa Barbara
55   I'm going to write you. I'm
56   living with this guy but I hate
57   him, I don't even know what I'm
58   doing with him."


59   "o.k.," I said, "but you're up
60   now. can you get me a glass of
61   water? I'm dry."

[Page 71 ]




62   she walked into the kitchen and
63   I heard her remark that
64   all my drinking glasses were
65   dirty.


66   I told her to use a
67   coffee cup. I
68   heard the water running and I
69   thought, one more fuck
70   I'll be even
71   and I can be in love with my girlfriend again---
72   that is
73   if she hasn't slipped in an
74   extra
75   and she probably
76   has.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /Chicago/ [from Love is a Dog from Hell:
        Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   "I've made it," she said, "I've come
2   through." she had on new boots, pants
3   and a white sweater. "I know what I
4   want now." she was from Chicago and
5   had settled in L.A.'s Fairfax district.


6   "you promised me champagne,"
7   she said.
8   "I was drunk when I phoned. how about
9   a beer?"
10   "no, pass me your joint."
11   she inhaled, let it out:
12   "this isn't very good stuff."
13   she handed it back.


14   "there's a difference," I said, "between
15   making it and simply becoming hard."


16   "you like my boots?"
17   "yes, very nice."
18   "listen, I've got to go. can I use
19   your bathroom?"
20   "sure."


21   when she came out she had on a
22   large lipstick mouth. I hadn't seen
23   one of those since I was a boy.
24   I kissed her in the doorway
25   feeling the lipstick rub off on my
26   lips.


27   "goodbye," she said.
28   "goodbye," I said.


29   she went up the walk toward her car.
30   I closed the door.

[Page 73 ]




31   she knew what she wanted and it wasn't
32   me.
33   I know more women like that than any
34   other kind.

        [from Love is a Dog from Hell: Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black
        Sparrow Press ]



1   all I've ever known are whores, ex-prostitutes,
2   madwomen. I see men with quiet,
3   gentle women---I see them in the supermarkets,
4   I see them walking down the streets together,
5   I see them in their apartments: people at
6   peace, living together. I know that their
7   peace is only partial, but there is
8   peace, often hours and days of peace.


9   all I've ever known are pill freaks, alcoholics,
10   whores, ex-prostitutes, madwomen.


11   when one leaves
12   another arrives
13   worse than her predecessor.


14   I see so many men with quiet clean girls in
15   gingham dresses
16   girls with faces that are not wolverine or
17   predatory.


18   "don't ever bring a whore around," I tell my
19   few friends, "I'll fall in love with her."


20   "you couldn't stand a good woman, Bukowski."


21   I need a good woman. I need a good woman
22   more than I need this typewriter, more than
23   I need my automobile, more than I need
24   Mozart; I need a good woman so badly that I
25   can taste her in the air, I can feel her
26   at my fingertips, I can see sidewalks built
27   for her feet to walk upon,
28   I can see pillows for her head,
29   I can feel my waiting laughter,

[Page 75 ]


30   I can see her petting a cat,
31   I can see her sleeping,
32   I can see her slippers on the floor.


33   I know that she exists
34   but where is she upon this earth
35   as the whores keep finding me?

8   ass and mouth.


9   I stare at him and
10   drive on

14   curbing in Arcadia,
15   blood seeping into my

3   grapefruit
4   faster than she could

6   then she
7   loved him.


8   "that won't always

10   Mike.


11   he grinned and said,
12   "yeh."


13   then he reached down
14   and touched his belt.
15   32 female scalps
16   dangled there.


17   "me and my big Jewish
18   cock," he said.


19   then he raised his hands
20   to indicate the
21   size.


22   "o, yeh, well,"
23   I said.


24   "they come around," he
25   said, "I fuck 'em, they
26   hang around, I tell 'em,
27   'it's time to leave.'"

28   "you've got guts,
29   Mike."


30   "this one wouldn't leave
31   so I just got up and
32   slapped her ... she
33   left."


34   "I don't have your nerve,

37   the shit-stains out of the
38   crapper, throwing out the
39   old Racing Forms ..."


40   "they'll never get me,"
41   he said,

43   look, Mike, no man is
44   invincible.
45   some day
46   you'll be sent mad by
47   eyes like a child's crayon
48   drawing. you won't be

50   water or walk across a
51   room. there will be the
52   walls and the sound of
53   the streets outside, and
54   you'll hear machineguns
55   and mortar shells. that'll

46   my hands slip
47   on the

49   I get my car
50   out

52   hill


53   almost crash it
54   into a

        Bukowski, Charles :  /the professors/ [from Love is a Dog from

1   sitting with the professors
2   we talk about Allen Tate
3   and John Crow Ransom
4   the rugs are clean and
5   the coffeetables shine
6   and there is talk of
7   budgets and works in
8   progress
9   and there is a
10   fireplace.
11   the kitchen floor is
12   well-waxed
13   and I have just eaten
14   dinner
15   after drinking until
16   3 a.m.
17   after reading
18   the night before


19   now I'm to read again
20   at a nearby college.
21   I'm in Arkansas in
22   January
23   somebody even mentions
24   Faulkner
25   I go to the bathroom
26   and vomit up the
27   dinner
28   when I come out
29   they are all in their
30   coats and overcoats
31   waiting in the
32   kitchen.
33   I'm to read in
34   15 minutes.

35   there'll be a
36   good crowd
37   they tell me.

1   don't worry about rejections, pard,
2   I've been rejected
3   before.


4   sometimes you make a mistake, taking
5   the wrong poem
6   more often I make the mistake, writing
7   it.


8   but I like a mount in every race
9   even though the man
10   who puts up the morning line


11   tabs it 30 to one.


12   I get to thinking about death more and
13   more


14   senility


15   crutches


16   armchairs


17   writing purple poetry with a
18   dripping pen


19   when the young girls with mouths
20   like barracudas
21   bodies like lemon trees
22   bodies like clouds
23   bodies like flashes of lightning
24   stop knocking on my door.


25   don't worry about rejections, pard.

[Page 91 ]




26   I have smoked 25 cigarettes tonight
27   and you know about the beer.


28   the phone has only rung once:
29   wrong number.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /how to be a great writer/ [from Love is a
        Dog from Hell: Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   you've got to fuck a great many women
2   beautiful women
3   and write a few decent love poems.


4   and don't worry about age
5   and/or freshly-arrived talents.


6   just drink more beer
7   more and more beer


8   and attend the racetrack at least once a
9   week


10   and win
11   if possible.


12   learning to win is hard---
13   any slob can be a good loser.


14   and don't forget your Brahms
15   and your Bach and your
16   /beer/ .


17   don't overexercise.


18   sleep until noon.


19   avoid credit cards


20   or paying for anything on
21   time.


22   remember that there isn't a piece of ass
23   in this world worth over $50
24   (in 1977).

[Page 93 ]




25   and if you have the ability to love
26   love yourself first
27   but always be aware of the possibility of
28   total defeat
29   whether the reason for that defeat
30   seems right or wrong---


31   an early taste of death is not necessarily
32   a bad thing.


33   stay out of churches and bars and museums,
34   and like the spider be
35   patient---
36   time is everybody's cross,
37   plus
38   exile
39   defeat
40   treachery


41   all that dross.


42   stay with the beer.


43   beer is continous blood.


44   a continuous lover.


45   get a large typewriter
46   and as the footsteps go up and down
47   outside your window


48   hit that thing
49   hit it hard


50   make it a heavyweight fight


51   make it the bull when he first charges in


52   and remember the old dogs
53   who fought so well:
54   Hemingway, Celine, Dostoevsky, Hamsun.

[Page 94 ]




55   if you think they didn't go crazy
56   in tiny rooms
57   just like you're doing now


58   without women
59   without food
60   without hope


61   then you're not ready.


62   drink more beer.
63   there's time.
64   and if there's not
65   that's all right
66   too.

        Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   drinking 15 dollar champagne---
2   Cordon Rouge---with the hookers.


3   one is named Georgia and she
4   doesn't like pantyhose:
5   I keep helping her pull up
6   her long dark stockings.


7   the other is Pam---prettier
8   but not much soul, and
9   we smoke and talk and I
10   play with their legs and
11   stick my bare foot into
12   Georgia's open purse.
13   it's filled with
14   bottles of pills. I
15   take some of the pills.


16   "listen," I say, "one of
17   you has soul, the other
18   looks. can't I combine
19   the 2 of you? take the soul
20   and stick it into the looks?"


21   "you want me," says Pam, "it
22   will cost you a hundred."


23   we drink some more and Georgia
24   falls to the floor and can't
25   get up.


26   I tell Pam that I like her
27   earrings very much. her
28   hair is long and a natural
29   red.

[Page 96 ]




30   "I was only kidding about the
31   hundred," she says.


32   "oh," I say, "what will it cost
33   me?"


34   she lights her cigarette with
35   my lighter and looks at me
36   through the flame:


37   her eyes tell me.


38   "look," I say, "I don't think I
39   can ever pay that price again."


40   she crosses her legs
41   inhales on her cigarette


42   as she exhales she smiles
43   and says, "sure you can."

1   the flesh covers the bone
2   and they put a mind
3   in there and
4   sometimes a soul,
5   and the women break
6   vases against the walls
7   and the men drink too
8   much
9   and nobody finds the
10   one
11   but they keep
12   looking
13   crawling in and out
14   of beds.
15   flesh covers
16   the bone and the
17   flesh searches
18   for more than
19   flesh.


20   there's no chance
21   at all:
22   we are all trapped
23   by a singular
24   fate.


25   nobody ever finds
26   the one.


27   the city dumps fill
28   the junkyards fill

2   they'd ask
3   "you finished your
4   2nd novel yet?"


5   "no."


6   "whatsamatta? whatsamatta
7   that you can't

9   "hemorrhoids and
10   insomnia."


11   "maybe you've lost

1   this is my piano.


2   the phone rings and people ask,
3   what are you doing? how about
4   getting drunk with us?


5   and I say,
6   I'm at my piano.


7   what?


8   I'm at my piano.


9   I hang up.


10   people need me. I fill
11   them. if they can't see me
12   for a while they get desperate, they get
13   sick.


14   but if I see them too often
15   I get sick. it's hard to feed
16   without getting fed.


17   my piano says things back to
18   me.


19   sometimes the things are
20   scrambled and not very good.
21   other times
22   I get as good and lucky as
23   Chopin.


24   sometimes I get out of practice
25   out of tune. that's
26   all right.

[Page 102 ]




27   I can sit down and vomit on the
28   keys
29   but it's my
30   vomit.


31   it's better than sitting in a room
32   with 3 or 4 people and
33   their pianos.


34   this is my piano
35   and it is better than theirs.


36   and they like it and they do not
37   like it.

1   she sits up there
2   drinking wine
3   while her husband
4   is at work.
5   she puts quite
6   some importance
7   upon getting her
8   poems published
9   in the little
10   magazines.
11   she's had two or
12   three of her slim
13   volumes of poems
14   done in mimeo.
15   she has two or
16   three children
17   between the ages
18   of 6 and 15.
19   she is no longer
20   the beautiful woman
21   she was. she sends
22   photos of herself
23   sitting upon a rock
24   by the ocean
25   alone and damned.
26   I could have had
27   her once. I wonder
28   if she thinks I
29   could have
30   saved her?


31   in all her poems
32   her husband is
33   never mentioned.
34   but she does

[Page 104 ]


35   talk about her
36   garden
37   so we know that's
38   there, anyhow,
39   and maybe she
40   fucks the rosebuds
41   and finches
42   before she writes
43   her poems

1   the cockroach crouched
2   against the tile
3   while I was pissing and as
4   I turned my head
5   he hauled his butt
6   into a crack.
7   I got the can and sprayed
8   and sprayed and sprayed
9   and finally the roach came out
10   and gave me a very dirty look.
11   then he fell down into
12   the bathtub and I watched
13   him dying
14   with a subtle pleasure
15   because I paid the rent
16   and he didn't.
17   I picked him up with
18   some greenblue toilet
19   paper and flushed him
20   away. that's all there
21   was to that, except
22   around Hollywood and
23   Western we have to
24   keep doing it.

1   I was shacked with a
2   24 year old girl from
3   New York City for
4   two weeks---about
5   the time of the garbage
6   strike out there, and
7   one night my 34 year
8   old woman arrived and
9   she said, "I want to see
10   my rival." she did
11   and then she said, "o,
12   you're a cute little thing!"
13   next I knew there was a
14   screech of wildcats---
15   such screaming and scratch-
16   ing, wounded animal moans,
17   blood and piss ...


18   I was drunk and in my
19   shorts. I tried to
20   separate them and fell,
21   wrenched my knee. then
22   they were through the screen
23   door and down the walk
24   and out in the street.


25   squadcars full of cops
26   arrived. a police heli-
27   copter circled overhead.


28   I stood in the bathroom
29   and grinned in the mirror.
30   it's not often at the age
31   of 55 that such splendid

[Page 107 ]


32   things occur.
33   better than the Watts
34   riots.


35   the 34 year old
36   came back in. she had
37   pissed all over her-
38   self and her clothing
39   was torn and she was
40   followed by 2 cops who
41   wanted to know why.


42   pulling up my shorts
43   I tried to explain.

1   listening to Bruckner on the radio
2   wondering why I'm not half mad
3   over the latest breakup with my
4   latest girlfriend


5   wondering why I'm not driving the streets
6   drunk
7   wondering why I'm not in the bedroom
8   in the dark
9   in the grievous dark
10   pondering
11   ripped by half-thoughts.


12   I suppose
13   that at last
14   like the average man:
15   I've known too many women
16   and instead of thinking,
17   I wonder who's fucking her now?
18   I think
19   she's giving some other poor son of a bitch
20   much trouble right now.


21   listening to Bruckner on the radio
22   seems so peaceful.


23   too many women have gone through.
24   I am at last alone
25   without being alone.


26   I pick up a Grumbacher paint brush
27   and clean my fingernails with the hard sharp end.


28   I notice a wall socket.


29   look, I've won.

1   the old folks play a game
2   in the park overlooking the sea
3   shoving markers across cement
4   with wooden sticks.
5   four play, two on each side
6   and 18 or 20 others sit in
7   the sun and watch
8   I notice this as I move
9   toward the public facility
10   as my car is being repaired.


11   an old cannon sits in the park
12   rusted and useless.
13   six or seven sailboats ride
14   the sea below.


15   I finish my duty
16   come out
17   and they are still playing.


18   one of the women is heavily rouged
19   wearing false eyelashes and smoking
20   a cigarette.
21   the men are very thin
22   very pale
23   wear wristwatches that hurt
24   their wrists.


25   the other woman is very fat
26   and giggles
27   each time a score is made


28   some of them are my age.


29   they disgust me
30   the way they wait for death

[Page 110 ]


31   with as much passion
32   as a traffic signal.


33   these are the people who believe advertisements
34   these are the people who buy dentures on credit
35   these are the people who celebrate holidays
36   these are the people who have grandchildren
37   these are the people who vote
38   these are the people who have funerals


39   these are the dead
40   the smog
41   the stink in the air
42   the lepers.


43   these are almost everybody
44   finally.


45   seagulls are better

51   I would.

31   the streets
32   the loneliness

34   are mine too.
35   and when I hang up the phone

37   secret.


38   I don't write out of

9   ---this playing at author

15   you've written them
16   you haven't been to Paris
17   but you've written all those books
18   there behind you
19   (and others not there,
20   lost or stolen)


21   all you've got to do

27   astonishingly big asses
28   and thinking---
29   somebody else is getting
30   it

[Page 114 ]




31   "look into my eyes,"
32   they say and click their cameras
33   and flash their cameras
34   and fondle their cameras


35   Hemingway used to box or go
36   fishing or to the bullfights
37   but after they leave
38   you jerk-off into the sheets
39   and take a hot bath


40   they never send the photos
41   like they promise to send the photos
42   and the astonishingly big asses are
43   gone forever
44   and you've been a fine literary fellow---
45   now alive

        Bukowski, Charles :  /one to the breastplate/ [from Love is a
        Dog from Hell: Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I have a saying, "the tough ones always come
2   back."


3   but Vera was kinder than most,
4   and so I was surprised when
5   she arrived that night
6   and said, "let me in."


7   "no, no, I'm working on a sonnet."


8   "I'll just stay a minute, then I'll
9   leave."


10   "Vera, if I let you in you'll be here
11   for 3 or 4 days."


12   it was night and I hadn't turned the
13   porch light on so I couldn't see it
14   coming
15   but
16   she threw a right that
17   exploded in the center of my
18   chest.


19   "baby, that was a beautiful punch.
20   now move off."


21   then I closed the door.


22   she was back again in 5 minutes:
23   "Hank, I can't find my car, I
24   swear I can't find my car. help
25   me find my car!"


26   I saw my friend Bobby-the-Riff

[Page 118 ]


27   walking by. "hey, Bobby, help
28   this one find her car. we'll
29   even it up later."


30   they went off together.


31   later Bobby said they found her
32   car parked on somebody's front
33   lawn, lights on and motor
34   running.


35   I haven't heard from Vera
36   since
37   unless she's the one
38   who keeps phoning at
39   2 and 3 and 4 a.m. in the
40   morning
41   and doesn't answer when I
42   say "hello."


43   but Bobby says he
44   can handle her
45   so I've decided to turn her over
46   to Bobby.


47   she lives on a side street somewhere
48   in Glendale
49   and I help him unfold the
50   roadmap as we sip our
51   diet Schlitz.

10   hanging from the doorknob
11   is an ad from the All American

19   you can get a free

1   sick with the flu
2   drinking beer
3   my radio on loud
4   enough to overcome
5   the sounds of the
6   stereo people who
7   have just moved
8   into the court
9   across the way.
10   asleep or awake
11   they play their
12   set at top volume
13   leaving their
14   doors and windows
15   open.


16   they are each
17   18, married, wear
18   red shoes,
19   are blonde,
20   slim.
21   they play
22   everything: jazz,
23   classical, rock,
24   country, modern
25   as long as it is
26   loud.


27   this is the problem
28   of being poor:
29   we must share each
30   other's sounds.
31   last week it was
32   my turn:
33   there were two women

[Page 125 ]


34   in here
35   fighting each other
36   and then they
37   ran up the walk
38   screaming.
39   the police came.


40   now it's their
41   turn.
42   now I am walking
43   up and down in
44   my dirty shorts,
45   two rubber earplugs
46   stuck deep into
47   my ears.


48   I even consider
49   murder.
50   such rude little
51   rabbits!
52   walking little pieces
53   of snot!


54   but in our land
55   and in our way
56   there has never
57   been a chance;
58   it's only when
59   things are not
60   going too badly
61   for a while
62   that we forget.


63   someday they'll
64   each be dead
65   someday they'll
66   each have a
67   separate coffin
68   and it will be
69   quiet.

1   once
2   starving in Philadelphia
3   I had a small room
4   it was evening going into night
5   and I stood at my window on the 3rd floor
6   in the dark and looked down into a
7   kitchen across the way on the 2nd floor
8   and I saw a beautiful blonde girl
9   embrace a young man there and kiss him
10   with what seemed hunger
11   and I stood and watched until they broke
12   away.
13   then I turned and switched on the room light.
14   I saw my dresser and my dresser drawers
15   and my alarm clock on the dresser.
16   I took my alarm clock
17   to bed with me and
18   fucked it until the hands dropped off.
19   then I went out and walked the streets
20   until my feet blistered.
21   when I got back I walked to the window
22   and looked down and across the way
23   and the light in their kitchen was
24   out.

3   when I think of myself dead
4   I think of frying pans


5   when I think of myself dead
6   I think of somebody making love to you
7   when I'm not around


8   when I think of myself dead
9   I have trouble breathing


10   when I think of myself dead
11   I think of all the people waiting to die


12   when I think of myself dead
13   I think I won't be able to drink water anymore


14   when I think of myself dead
15   the air goes all white


16   the roaches in my kitchen
17   tremble


18   and somebody will have to throw
19   my clean and dirty underwear
20   away.

1   Christmas eve, alone,
2   in a motel room
3   down the coast
4   near the Pacific---
5   hear it?


6   they've tried to do this place up
7   Spanish, there's
8   tapestry and lamps, and
9   the toilet's clean, there are
10   tiny bars of pink
11   soap.


12   they won't find us
13   here:
14   the barracudas or the ladies or
15   the idol
16   worshippers.


17   back in town
18   they're drunk and panicked
19   running red lights
20   breaking their heads open
21   in honor of Christ's
22   birthday. that's nice.


23   soon I'll finish this 5th of
24   Puerto Rican rum.
25   in the morning I'll vomit and
26   shower, drive back
27   in, have a sandwich by 1 p.m.,
28   be back in my room by
29   2,
30   stretched on the bed,
31   waiting for the phone to ring,

[Page 130 ]


32   not answering,
33   my holiday is an
34   evasion, my reasoning
35   is not.

10   like the roach


11   never take your eyes off the roach


12   you'll never see it again.

1   think of the beds
2   used again and again
3   to fuck in
4   to die in.


5   in this land
6   some of us fuck more than
7   we die
8   but most of us die
9   better than we
10   fuck,
11   and we die
12   piece by piece too---
13   in parks
14   eating ice cream, or
15   in igloos
16   of dementia,
17   or on straw mats
18   or upon disembarked
19   loves
20   or
21   or.


22   :beds beds beds
23   :toilets toilets toilets


24   the human sewage system
25   is the world's greatest
26   invention.


27   and you invented me
28   and I invented you
29   and that's why we don't
30   get along

[Page 133 ]


31   on this bed
32   any longer.
33   you were the world's
34   greatest invention
35   until you
36   flushed me
37   away.

41   somebody will do it
42   to you,
43   bitch,
44   and if they don't
45   you will---

2   or the other time
3   or the time before that.
4   here's a cock
5   and here's a cunt
6   and here's trouble.


7   only each time
8   you think
9   well now I've learned:
10   I'll let her do that
11   and I'll do this,
12   I no longer want it all,
13   just some comfort
14   and some sex
15   and only a minor
16   love.


17   now I'm waiting again
18   and the years run thin.
19   I have my radio
20   and the kitchen walls
21   are yellow.
22   I keep dumping bottles
23   and listening
24   for footsteps.

26   less than this.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /imagination and reality/ [from Love is a
        Dog from Hell: Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   there are many single women in the world
2   with one or two or three children
3   and one wonders where the husbands
4   have gone or where the lovers have
5   gone
6   leaving behind
7   all those hands and eyes and feet
8   and voices.
9   as I pass through their homes
10   I like opening cupboards and
11   looking in
12   or under the sink
13   or in a closet---
14   I expect to find the husband
15   or lover and he'll tell me:
16   "hey, buddy, didn't you notice her
17   stretch-marks, she's got stretch-marks
18   and floppy tits and she eats
19   onions all the time and farts ... but
20   /I'm/ a handy man. I can fix things,
21   I know how to use a turret-lathe and
22   I make my own oil changes. I can shoot
23   pool, bowl, and I can finish 5th or
24   6th in any cross-country marathon
25   anywhere. I've got a set of golf
26   clubs, can shoot in the 80's. I know
27   where the clit is and what to do about
28   it. I've got a cowboy hat with the brim
29   turned straight up at the sides.
30   I'm good with the lasso and the dukes
31   and I know all the latest dance steps."


32   and I'll say, "look, I was just leaving."
33   and I /will/ leave before he can challenge me
34   to arm-wrestling

[Page 136 ]


35   or tell a dirty joke
36   or show me the dancing tattoo on his
37   right bicep.


38   but really
39   all I find in the cupboards are
40   coffee cups and large cracked brown plates
41   and under the sink a stack of hardened
42   rags, and in the closet---more coathangers
43   than clothes, and it's not until she shows
44   me the photo album and the photos of him---
45   nice enough like a shoehorn, or a cart in
46   the supermarket whose wheels aren't stuck---
47   that the self-doubt leaves, and the
48   pages turn and there's one child on a
49   swing wearing a red outfit and there's
50   the other one
51   chasing a seagull in Santa Monica.
52   and life becomes sad and not dangerous
53   and therefore good enough:
54   to have her bring you a cup of coffee in
55   one of those coffee cups without /him/
56   jumping out.

1   I keep thinking it will be outside
2   now
3   waiting for me
4   blue
5   front bumper twisted
6   Maltese cross hanging
7   from the mirror.
8   rubber floormat
9   twisted under the pedals.
10   20 m.p.g.
11   good old TRV 491
12   the faithful love of a man,
13   the way I put her into second
14   while taking a corner
15   the way she could dig from a signal
16   with any other around.
17   the way we conquered large and
18   small spaces
19   rain
20   sun
21   smog
22   hostility
23   the crush of things.


24   I came out of last Thursday night's
25   fights at the Olympic
26   and my 1967 Volks was gone
27   with another lover
28   to another place.


29   the fights had been good.
30   I called a cab at a Standard station
31   and sat eating a jelly doughnut
32   with coffee in a cafe and
33   waited,

[Page 138 ]


34   and I knew that if I found
35   the man who stole her
36   I would kill him.


37   the cab came. I waved to the
38   driver, paid for the coffee and
39   doughnut, got out into the night,
40   got in, and told him, "Hollywood
41   and Western," and that particular
42   night was just about over.

2   all through grammar school
3   junior high
4   high school

7   themselves to
8   me.
9   guys with one arm

14   cowards
15   misanthropes

22   I always drew the
23   unwanted. they found me
24   right off and attached
25   themselves. they
26   still do.
27   in this neighborhood now
28   there's one who's
29   found me.
30   he pushes around a
31   shopping cart
32   filled with trash:
33   broken canes, shoelaces,
34   empty potato chip bags,

[Page 141 ]


35   milk cartons, newspapers, penholders ...
36   "hey, buddy, how ya doin'?"
37   I stop and we talk a
38   while.
39   then I say goodbye
40   but he still follows
41   me
42   past the beer
43   parlours and the
44   love parlours ...
45   "keep me /informed/ ,
46   buddy, keep me /informed/ ,
47   I want to know what's
48   going on."
49   he's my new one.
50   I've never seen him
51   talk to anybody
52   else.
53   the cart rattles
54   along a little bit
55   behind me
56   then something

58   he stops to pick
59   it up.
60   as he does I
61   walk through the
62   front door of the
63   green hotel on the
64   corner
65   pass down through
66   the hall
67   come out the back
68   door and
69   there's a cat
70   shitting there in
71   absolute delight,
72   he grins at
73   me.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /Big Max/ [from Love is a Dog from Hell:
        Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   in junior high school
2   Big Max was a problem.
3   we'd be sitting during lunch hour
4   eating our peanut butter sandwiches
5   and potato chips.
6   he was hairy of nostril
7   and of eyebrow, his lips
8   glistened with spittle.
9   he already wore size ten and a half
10   shoes. his shirts stretched across a
11   massive chest. his wrists looked like
12   two by fours. and he walked up
13   through the shadows behind the gym
14   where we sat, my friend Eli and I.
15   "you guys," he stood there, "you guys
16   sit with your shoulders slumped!
17   you walk around with your shoulders
18   slumped! how are you ever going to
19   make it?"


20   we didn't answer.


21   then Max would look at me.
22   "stand up!"


23   I'd stand up and he'd walk around
24   behind me and say, "square your
25   shoulders like this!"


26   and he'd snap my shoulders back.
27   "there! doesn't that feel /better?/ "


28   "yeah, Max."


29   then he'd walk off and I'd resume a
30   normal posture.

[Page 143 ]




31   Big Max was ready for the
32   world. it made us sick
33   to look at him.

1   in the winter walking on my
2   ceiling my eyes the size of street-
3   lamps. I have 4 feet like a mouse but
4   wash my own underwear---bearded and
5   hungover and a hard-on and no lawyer. I
6   have a face like a washrag. I sing
7   love songs and carry steel.


8   I would rather die than cry. I can't
9   stand hounds can't live without them.
10   I hang my head against the white
11   refrigerator and want to scream like
12   the last weeping of life forever but
13   I am bigger than the mountains.

1   I'm soft. I
2   dream too.
3   I let myself dream. I dream of
4   being famous. I dream of
5   walking the streets of London and
6   Paris. I dream of
7   sitting in cafes
8   drinking fine wines and
9   taking a taxi back to a good
10   hotel.
11   I dream of
12   meeting beautiful ladies in the hall
13   and
14   turning them away because
15   I have a sonnet in mind that
16   I want to write
17   before sunrise. at sunrise
18   I will be asleep and there will be a
19   strange cat curled up on the
20   windowsill.


21   I think we all feel like this
22   now and then.
23   I'd even like to visit
24   Andernach, Germany, the place where
25   I began. then I'd like to
26   fly on to Moscow to check out
27   their mass transit system so
28   I'd have something faintly lewd to
29   whisper into the ear of the mayor of
30   Los Angeles upon my return to this
31   fucking place.


32   it could happen.
33   I'm ready.

[Page 147 ]




34   I've watched snails climb over
35   ten foot walls and
36   vanish.


37   you mustn't confuse this with
38   ambition.
39   I would be able to laugh at my
40   good turn of the cards---


41   and I won't forget you.
42   I'll send postcards and
43   snapshots, and the
44   finished sonnet.

1   beheaded in the middle of the
2   night
3   scratching my sides
4   I am covered with bites
5   kick my white legs out of the sheets
6   as the sirens scream
7   there is a gun blast.


8   I go to the kitchen
9   for a glass of water
10   destroy the reverie of a roach
11   destroy the roach.
12   a gale comes from the North
13   as the man in the apartment across
14   from me
15   inserts his penis into the rump of his
16   4 year old
17   daughter.


18   I hear the screams
19   light a cigar
20   stick it into the lips of my
21   beheaded head.
22   it is half a cigar
23   stale
24   a /Medalist Naturáles/ , No. 7.


25   I walk back to the bedroom
26   with a spray can.
27   I press the button.
28   it hisses. I
29   gag,
30   think of ancient wars
31   loves dead.

32   so much happens in the dark
33   yet tomorrow
34   the sun will move up and on,
35   you'll get a ticket if you park on the
36   south side of the street on
37   Thursday
38   or the north side on
39   Friday.


40   the efficiency of the sun and the
41   law
42   bulwarks sanity.


43   something bites me.
44   I madden
45   spray half my
46   bedsheets.


47   I turn
48   see the dark mirror---
49   the cigar
50   the loose belly
51   me
52   old.


53   I laugh.


54   it's good they don't
55   know.


56   I take my head


57   put it back on my
58   neck


59   get between the sheets and


60   can't sleep.

        Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the Mexican dancer shook her fans at
2   me and her ass at me, I
3   didn't ask her to and
4   my woman got mad and ran out of the cafe and
5   it began raining and you could hear it on the
6   roof and I didn't have a job and I had 13 days left
7   on the rent.
8   sometimes when a woman runs out on you like
9   that you wonder if it's not
10   economics, you can't blame them---
11   if I had to get fucked I'd rather get fucked
12   by somebody with money.
13   we're all scared but when you're ugly and you
14   don't have much left you get
15   strong, and I called the waiter over and I said,
16   I think I am going to turn this table over, I'm
17   bored, I'm insane, I need
18   action, call in your goon, I'll piss on his
19   collarbone.


20   I got
21   thrown out swiftly. it was
22   raining. I picked myself up in the rain and
23   walked down the empty street
24   cotton candy sweet
25   dumb shit for sale, all the little stores locked
26   with 67¢ Woolworth locks.


27   I reached the end of the street in time
28   to see her get into the yellow cab with
29   another guy.


30   I fell down by a garbage can, stood up
31   and pissed against it, feeling sad and not
32   sad, knowing there was only so much they could do to

[Page 151 ]


33   you, piss sliding down the corrugated
34   tin, the philosophers must have had something to
35   say about this. women. their luck against your
36   destiny. winner take Barcelona. next
37   bar.

1   the men phone and ask me that.


2   are you really Charles Bukowski
3   the writer? they ask.


4   I'm a sometimes writer, I say,
5   most often I don't do anything.


6   listen, they ask, I like your
7   stuff---do you mind if I come
8   over and bring a couple of 6
9   packs?


10   you can bring them, I say
11   if /you/ don't come in ...



12   when the women phone, I say,
13   o yes, I /write/ , I'm a writer
14   only I'm not writing right now.


15   I feel foolish phoning you,
16   they say, and I was surprised
17   to find you listed in the phone book.


18   I have reasons, I say,
19   by the way why don't you come over
20   for a beer?


21   you wouldn't mind?


22   and they arrive
23   handsome women
24   good of mind and body and eye.

[Page 153 ]




25   often there isn't sex
26   but I'm used to that
27   yet it's good
28   very good just to look at them---
29   and some rare times
30   I have unexpected good luck
31   otherwise.


32   for a man of 55 who didn't get laid
33   until he was 23
34   and not very often until he was 50
35   I think that I should stay listed
36   via Pacific Telephone
37   until I get as much as
38   the average man has had.


39   of course, I'll have to keep
40   writing immortal poems
41   but the inspiration is there.

1   I suppose it's raining in some Spanish town
2   now
3   while I'm feeling bad
4   like this;
5   I'd like to think so
6   now.
7   let's go to a Mexican hamlet---
8   that sounds nice:
9   a Mexican hamlet
10   while I'm feeling bad
11   like this
12   the walls yellow with age---
13   that rain
14   out there,
15   a pig moving in his pen at night
16   disturbed by the rain,
17   little eyes like cigarette-ends,
18   and his damned tail:
19   see it?
20   I can't imagine the people.
21   it's hard for me to imagine the people.
22   maybe they are feeling bad like this,
23   almost as bad as this.
24   I wonder what they do when they feel
25   bad?
26   they probably don't mention it.
27   they say,
28   "look, it's raining."
29   that's the best way.

1   dogs and angels are not
2   very different.
3   I often go to this place
4   to eat
5   about 2.30 in the afternoon
6   because all the people who eat
7   there are particularly addled
8   simply glad to be alive and
9   eating baked beans
10   near a plate glass window
11   which holds the heat
12   and doesn't let the cars and
13   sidewalks inside.


14   we are allowed as much free
15   coffee as we can drink
16   and we sit and quietly drink
17   the black strong coffee.


18   it is good to be sitting someplace
19   in a world at 2:30 in the afternoon
20   without having the flesh ripped from
21   your bones. even
22   being addled, we know this.


23   nobody bothers us
24   we bother nobody.


25   angels and dogs are not
26   very different
27   at 2:30 in the afternoon.


28   I have my favorite table
29   and after I have finished
30   I stack the plates, saucers,

[Page 158 ]


31   the cup, the silverware
32   neatly---
33   my offering to the luck---
34   and that sun
35   working good
36   all up and

1   "she shoots up in the neck," she told
2   me. I told her to stick it into my
3   ass and she tried and said, "oh oh,"
4   and I said, "what the hell's the matter?"
5   she said, "nothing, this is New York
6   style," and she jammed it in again and said,
7   "oh shit." I took it and put it into
8   my arm, I got part of it.
9   "I don't know why people
10   fuck with the stuff, there's not that
11   much to it. I think they're all losers
12   and they want to lose real bad. there's
13   no other way, it's like they can't

15   and there's no other way.
16   this has got to be it.
17   she shoots up in the neck."


18   "I know," I said. "I phoned her, she
19   could hardly talk, said it was
20   laryngitis. have some of this wine."


21   it was white wine and 4:30 a.m. and her
22   daughter was sleeping in the bedroom. she
23   had cable tv with no sound and
24   a large screen young John Wayne watched
25   us, and we neither kissed nor made
26   love and I left at 6:15 a.m.
27   after the beer and wine were gone
28   so her daughter wouldn't awaken for
29   school and find me sitting in
30   bed with her mother
31   with John Wayne and the night gone
32   and not much chance for anybody---

5   purple housewives
6   fingering 75 cent avocados

9   I am a man with a switchball watch
10   standing in a honky-tonk phonebooth
11   sucking strawberry red titty
12   upsidedown in a Philadelphia crowd.


13   suddenly all about me are screams of
14   RAPE RAPE RAPE RAPE RAPE

16   dyed red hair, bad breath, blue teeth


17   I used to like Monet

6   laughter or
7   tears


8   haters

13   armies running through

15   waving winebottles
16   bayoneting and fucking

19   with a photograph of M. Monroe.


20   there is a loneliness in this world so great

30   we are afraid.


31   our educational system tells us
32   that we can all be
33   big-ass winners.


34   it hasn't told us
35   about the gutters
36   or the suicides.


37   or the terror of one person
38   aching in one place
39   alone


40   untouched
41   unspoken to


42   watering a plant.


43   people are not good to each other.
44   people are not good to each other.
45   people are not good to each other.


46   I suppose they never will be.
47   I don't ask them to be.


48   but sometimes I think about
49   it.

59   more haters than lovers.


60   people are not good to each other.

63   meanwhile I look at young girls
64   stems
65   flowers of chance.


66   there must be a way.


67   surely there must be a way we have not yet
68   thought of.


69   who put this brain inside of me?

21   "o.k., get it on over."


22   and I hang up thinking
23   maybe this is it


24   go in
25   take a quick shit
26   shave

[Page 170 ]




27   bathe


28   dress


29   dump the sacks
30   and cartons of empty
31   bottles


32   sit down to the sound of
33   heels approaching
34   more an army approaching than
35   victory


36   it's Scarlet
37   and in my kitchen the faucet
38   keeps dripping
39   needs a washer.


40   I'll take care of it
41   later.

1   red hair
2   real
3   she whirled it
4   and she asked
5   "is my ass still on?"


6   such comedy.


7   there is always one woman
8   to save you from another


9   and as that woman saves you
10   she makes ready to
11   destroy.


12   "sometimes I hate you,"
13   she said.


14   she walked out and sat on
15   my porch and read my copy
16   of Catullus, she stayed out
17   there for an hour.


18   people walked up and down
19   past my place
20   wondering where such an ugly
21   old man could get
22   such beauty.


23   I didn't know either.


24   when she walked in I grabbed
25   her and pulled her to my lap.
26   I lifted my glass and told
27   her, "drink this."

[Page 172 ]




28   "oh," she said, "you've mixed
29   wine with Jim Beam, you're gonna
30   get nasty."


31   "you henna your hair, don't
32   you?"


33   "you don't /look/ ," she said and
34   stood up and pulled down her
35   slacks and panties and
36   the hair down there was the
37   same as the hair
38   up there.


39   Catullus himself couldn't have wished
40   for more historic or
41   wondrous grace;
42   then he went
43   goofy


44   for tender boys
45   not mad enough
46   to become
47   women.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /like a flower in the rain/ [from Love is a
        Dog from Hell: Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   I cut the middle fingernail of the middle
2   finger
3   right hand
4   real short
5   and I began rubbing along her cunt
6   as she sat upright in bed
7   spreading lotion over her arms
8   face
9   and breasts
10   after bathing.
11   then she lit a cigarette:
12   "don't let this put you off,"
13   and smoked and continued to rub the
14   lotion on.
15   I continued to rub the cunt.
16   "you want an apple?" I asked.
17   "sure," she said, "you got one?"
18   but I got to her---
19   she began to twist
20   then she rolled on her side,
21   she was getting wet and open
22   like a flower in the rain.
23   then she rolled on her stomach
24   and her most beautiful ass
25   looked up at me
26   and I reached under and got the
27   cunt again.
28   she reached around and got my
29   cock, she rolled and twisted,
30   I mounted
31   my face falling into the mass
32   of red hair that overflowed
33   from her head
34   and my fattened cock entered
35   into the miracle.

[Page 174 ]


36   later we joked about the lotion
37   and the cigarette and the apple.
38   then I went out and got some chicken
39   and shrimp and french fries and buns
40   and mashed potatoes and gravy and
41   cole slaw, and we ate. she told me
42   how good she felt and I told her
43   how good I felt and we ate
44   the chicken and the shrimp and the
45   french fries and the buns and the
46   mashed potatoes and the gravy and
47   the cole slaw too.

1   light brown stare


2   that dumb blank marvelous
3   light brown stare


4   I'll take care of
5   it.


6   you needn't carry me
7   anymore
8   with your Cleopatra

14   tabulating
15   how many times you've used
16   that light brown stare?


17   not that you're not the best
18   with your light brown stare.


19   someday some crazy son of a bitch
20   is going to murder you


21   and you'll cry out my name

1   I go to pick her up.
2   she's on some errand.
3   she always has errands
4   many things to do.
5   I have nothing to do.


6   she comes out of her apartment
7   I see her move toward my car


8   she is barefooted
9   dressed casually
10   except for huge ear rings.


11   I light a cigarette
12   and when I look up
13   she is stretched out on the street


14   a quite busy street


15   all 112 pounds of her
16   as beautiful as anything you might
17   imagine.


18   I switch on the radio
19   and wait for her to get up.


20   she does.


21   I flip the car door open.
22   she gets in. I drive away from the
23   curb. she likes the song on the radio
24   she turns the radio up.


25   she seems to like all the songs
26   she seems to know all the songs

[Page 177 ]




27   each time I see her she looks better
28   and better


29   200 years ago they would have burned her
30   at the stake


31   now she puts on her
32   mascara as we
33   drive along.

1   the cops want me to come down and identify

3   I've lost the key to my car again; I've got

10   she's had those cracked ribs, you know,
11   and one of them punctured her lung. she's
12   down at the county under a machine.


13   where's my comb?

1   consistency is terrific:
2   shark-mouth
3   grubby interior with an
4   almost perfect body,
5   long blazing hair---
6   it confuses me
7   and others


8   she runs from man to man
9   offering endearments


10   she speaks of love


11   then breaks each man
12   to her will


13   shark-mouthed
14   grubby interior


15   we see it too late:
16   after the cock gets swallowed
17   the heart follows


18   her long blazing hair
19   her almost perfect body
20   walks down the street
21   as the same sun
22   falls upon flowers.

1   she's not for you, man,
2   she's not your type,
3   she's erased
4   she's been used
5   she's got all the wrong
6   habits,
7   he told me
8   in between races.


9   I'm going to bet the 4
10   horse, I told him.
11   well, it's only that I'd
12   like to turn her around
13   in mid-stream,
14   save her, you might say.


15   you can't save her, he said,
16   you're 55, you need kindness.
17   I'm going to bet the 6 horse.
18   you're not the one to save
19   her.


20   who can save her? I asked.
21   I don't think the 6 has a
22   chance, I like the 4.


23   she needs somebody to beat her
24   from wall to wall, he said,
25   kick her ass, she'd love
26   it. she'd stay home and
27   wash the dishes.
28   the 6 horse will be in
29   the running.


30   I'm no good at beating women,
31   I said.

[Page 181 ]




32   forget her then, he said.


33   it's hard to, I said.


34   he got up and bet the 6
35   and I got up and bet the 4.
36   the 5 horse won
37   by 3 lengths
38   at 15 to one.


39   she's got red hair
40   like lightning from heaven,
41   I said.


42   forget her, he said.


43   we tore up our tickets
44   and stared at the lake
45   in the center of the track.


46   it was going to be
47   a long afternoon
48   for both of us.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /the promise/ [from Love is a Dog from
        Hell: Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   she bent over the side of the bed
2   and opened the portfolio
3   along the side of the wall.
4   we were drinking.
5   she said, "you promised me these
6   paintings once, don't you
7   remember?"
8   "what? no, no, I don't remember."
9   "well, you did," she said, "and you
10   ought to keep your promises."
11   "leave those fucking paintings alone,"
12   I said.
13   then I walked into the kitchen for
14   a beer. I paused to vomit
15   and when I came out
16   I saw her through my window
17   going down the court walk
18   toward her place in back.
19   she was trying to hurry
20   and balanced on top of her head
21   were 40 paintings:
22   oils
23   black and whites
24   acrylics
25   water colors.
26   she stumbled once and almost
27   fell on her ass.
28   then she ran up her steps
29   and was gone through her door
30   to her place upstairs
31   running with all those paintings
32   on top of her head.
33   it was one of the funniest damned
34   things I ever did see.

[Page 183 ]


35   well, I guess I'll just have to
36   paint 40 more.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /waving and waving goodbye/ [from Love is a
        Dog from Hell: Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I paid this one's fare all the way from Houston
2   to San Francisco
3   then flew up to meet her at her brother's house
4   and I got drunk
5   and talked all night about a redhead, and
6   she finally said, "you sleep up there,"
7   and I climbed the ladder
8   up into a bunk and she slept
9   down there.


10   the next day they drove me to the airport
11   and I flew back, thinking, well,
12   there's still the redhead and when I got back in
13   I phoned the redhead and said, "I'm back, baby,
14   I flew up to see this woman and I talked about
15   you all night, so here I am ..."


16   "well, why don't you fly back up and finish
17   the job?" she said and hung up.


18   then I got drunk and the phone rang
19   and they said they were
20   two ladies from Germany and they'd like
21   to see me.


22   so they came over and one was 20 and the
23   other was 22. I told them that my heart
24   had been smashed for the last time and
25   that I was giving up women. they laughed
26   at me and we drank and smoked and went to
27   bed together.


28   I got this thing in front of me and
29   first I grabbed one and then I grabbed the
30   other.

[Page 185 ]




31   I finally settled on the 22 year old and
32   ate her up.


33   they stayed 2 days and 2 nights
34   but I never got to the 20 year old,
35   she was on tampax.


36   I finally drove them to Sherman Oaks
37   and they stood at the foot of a long
38   driveway
39   waving and waving goodbye as I backed
40   my Volks out.


41   when I got back there was a letter from a
42   lady in Eureka. she said that she wanted me
43   to fuck her until she couldn't
44   walk anymore.


45   I stretched out and whacked-off
46   thinking about a little girl I had seen
47   on a red bicycle about a week ago.


48   then I took a bath and put on my green
49   terrycloth robe just in time to get the fights
50   on tv from the Olympic.


51   there was a black and a Chicano in there.
52   that always made a good fight.


53   and it was a good idea too:
54   put them in there and let them kill each
55   other.


56   I watched the whole fight
57   thinking about the redhead all the time.


58   I think the Chicano won
59   but I'm not sure.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /liberty/ [from Love is a Dog from Hell:

1   she was sitting in the window
2   of room 1010 at the Chelsea
3   in New York,
4   Janis Joplin's old room.
5   it was 104 degrees
6   and she was on speed
7   and had one leg over
8   the sill,
9   and she leaned out and said,
10   "God, this is great!"
11   and then she slipped
12   and almost went out,
13   just catching herself.
14   it was very close.
15   she pulled herself in
16   walked over and stretched
17   on the bed.


18   I've lost a lot of women
19   in a lot of different ways
20   but that would have been
21   the first time
22   that way.


23   then she rolled off the bed
24   landed on her back
25   and when I walked over
26   she was asleep.


27   all day she had been wanting
28   to see the Statue of Liberty.
29   now she wouldn't worry me about that
30   for a while.

1   she's up seeing my doctor
2   trying to get some diet pills;
3   she's not fat, she needs the speed.
4   I go down to the nearest bar and wait.
5   at 3:30 in the afternoon of a tuesday.
6   they have a dancer.


7   there's only one other man in the bar.


8   she works out
9   looking at herself in the mirror.
10   she's like a monkey
11   dark
12   Korean.


13   she's not very good,
14   skinny and obvious
15   and she sticks her tongue out at me
16   then at the other man.


17   times must be truly hard, I think.


18   I have a few more beers then get up to leave.
19   she waves me over.
20   "you go?" she asks.
21   "yes," I say, "my wife has cancer."


22   I shake her hand.


23   she points to a sign behind her:
24   DON'T TOUCH THE GIRLS.


25   she points to the sign and says,
26   "the sign says, 'DON'T TOUCH THE GIRLS'."

[Page 188 ]




27   I go back to the parking lot and wait.
28   she comes out.
29   "did you get the pills?" I ask.
30   "yes," she says.
31   "then it's been a successful day."


32   I think of the dancer walking across my
33   kitchen. I can't visualize it. I am going
34   to die alone
35   just the way I live.


36   "take me to my place," she says,
37   "I've got to get ready for night school."


38   "sure," I say and drive her on in.

1   I never wear dark shades
2   but this red head went to get
3   a prescription filled on Hollywood Blvd.
4   and she kept haggling and working at
5   me, snapping and snarling.
6   I left her at the prescription counter
7   and walked around and got a large tube of
8   Crest and a giant bottle of Joy.
9   then I walked up to
10   the dark shade display rack and bought
11   the most vicious pair of shades
12   I could find.
13   we paid for our things
14   walked down to a Mexican place
15   and she ordered a taco she couldn't eat
16   and sat there
17   haggling and snapping and snarling at me
18   and after eating I ordered 3 beers
19   drank them down
20   then put on my shades.
21   "o my God," she said, "o my God shit!"
22   and I ripped her up both sides
23   most excellent riposte
24   snarling stinking marmalade shots
25   shit blows
26   farts from hell,
27   then I got up
28   paid
29   she following me out
30   both of us in shades
31   and the sidewalks split.
32   we found her car
33   got in and drove off
34   me sitting there
35   pushing the shades back against my nose

[Page 190 ]


36   ripping out her backbone
37   and waving it out the window
38   like a broken Confederate flagpole ...
39   dark and vicious shades help.
40   "o my God shit!" she said,
41   and the sun was up
42   and I didn't know it.


43   they were a bargain for $4.25
44   even though I had left the Crest
45   and the Joy behind
46   at the taco place.

1   by God, I don't know what to
2   do.
3   they're so nice to have around.
4   they have a way of playing with
5   the balls
6   and looking at the cock very
7   seriously
8   turning it
9   tweeking it
10   examining each part
11   as their long hair falls on
12   your belly.


13   it's not the fucking and sucking
14   alone that reaches into a man
15   and softens him, it's the extras,
16   it's all the extras.


17   now it's raining tonight
18   and there's nobody
19   they are elsewhere
20   examining things
21   in new bedrooms
22   in new moods
23   or maybe in old
24   bedrooms.


25   anyhow, it's raining tonight,
26   one hell of a dashing, pouring
27   rain....


28   very little to do.
29   I've read the newspaper
30   paid the gas bill
31   the electric co.
32   the phone bill.

[Page 192 ]




33   it keeps raining.


34   they soften a man
35   and then let him swim
36   in his own juice.


37   I need an old-fashioned whore
38   at the door tonight
39   closing her green umbrella,
40   drops of moonlit rain on her
41   purse, saying, "shit, man,
42   can't you get better music
43   than /that/ on your radio?
44   and turn up the heat ..."


45   it's always when a man's swollen
46   with love and everything
47   else
48   that it keeps raining
49   splattering
50   flooding
51   rain
52   good for the trees and the
53   grass and the air ...
54   good for things that
55   live alone.


56   I would give anything
57   for a female's hand on me
58   tonight.
59   they soften a man and
60   then leave him
61   listening to the rain.

1   the history of melancholia
2   includes all of us.


3   me, I writhe in dirty sheets
4   while staring at blue walls
5   and nothing.


6   I have gotten so used to melancholia
7   that
8   I greet it like an old
9   friend.


10   I will now do 15 minutes of grieving
11   for the lost redhead,
12   I tell the gods.


13   I do it and feel quite bad
14   quite sad,
15   then I rise
16   CLEANSED
17   even though nothing is
18   solved.


19   that's what I get for kicking
20   religion in the ass.


21   I should have kicked the redhead
22   in the ass
23   where her brains and her bread and
24   butter are
25   at ...


26   but, no, I've felt sad
27   about everything:

[Page 194 ]




28   the lost redhead was just another
29   smash in a lifelong
30   loss ...


31   I listen to drums on the radio now
32   and grin.


33   there is something wrong with me
34   besides
35   melancholia.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /a stethoscope case/ [from Love is a Dog
        from Hell: Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   my doctor has just come into his office
2   from surgery.
3   he meets me in the men's john.
4   "God damn," he says to me,
5   "where did you find her? oh, I just like
6   to /look/ at girls like that!"
7   I tell him: "it's my specialty: cement
8   hearts and beautiful bodies. If you can find
9   a heart-beat, let me know."
10   "I'll take good care of her," he says.
11   "yes, and please remember all the ethical
12   codes of your honorable profession," I tell
13   him.


14   he zips up first then washes.
15   "how's your health?" he asks.


16   "physically I'm sound as a tic. mentally I'm
17   wasted, doomed, on my tiny cross, all that
18   crap."


19   "I'll take good care of her."


20   "yes. and let me know about the heart-beat."


21   he walks out.
22   I finish, zip up and also walk out.
23   only I don't wash up.


24   I'm far beyond all that.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /eat your heart out/ [from Love is a Dog
        from Hell: Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I've come by, she says, to tell you
2   that this is it. I'm not kidding, it's
3   over. this is it.


4   I sit on the couch watching her arrange
5   her long red hair before my bedroom
6   mirror.
7   she pulls her hair up and
8   piles it on top of her head---
9   she lets her eyes look at
10   my eyes---
11   then she drops the hair and
12   lets it fall down in front of her face.


13   we go to bed and I hold her
14   speechlessly from the back
15   my arm around her neck
16   I touch her wrists and hands
17   feel up to
18   her elbows
19   no further.


20   she gets up.


21   this is it, she says,
22   eat your heart out. you
23   got any rubber bands?


24   I don't know.


25   here's one, she says,
26   this will do. well,
27   I'm going.


28   I get up and walk her
29   to the door

[Page 197 ]




30   just as she leaves
31   she says,
32   I want you to buy me
33   some high-heeled shoes
34   with tall thin spikes,
35   black high-heeled shoes.
36   no, I want them
37   red.


38   I watch her walk down the cement walk
39   under the trees
40   she walks all right and
41   as the poinsettas drip in the sun
42   I close the door.

1   this time has finished me.


2   I feel like the German troops
3   whipped by snow and the communists
4   walking bent
5   with newspapers stuffed into
6   worn boots.


7   my plight is just as terrible.
8   maybe more so.


9   victory was so close
10   victory was there.


11   as she stood before my mirror
12   younger and more beautiful than
13   any woman I had ever known
14   combing yards and yards of red hair
15   as I watched her.


16   and when she came to bed
17   she was more beautiful than ever
18   and the love was very very good.


19   eleven months.


20   now she's gone
21   gone as they go.



22   this time has finished me.


23   it's a long road back

[Page 199 ]


24   and back to where?


25   the guy ahead of me
26   falls.


27   I step over him.


28   did she get him too?

1   I reached up into the top of the closet
2   and took out a pair of blue panties
3   and showed them to her and
4   asked "are these yours?"


5   and she looked and said,
6   "no, those belong to a dog."


7   she left after that and I haven't seen
8   her since. she's not at her place.
9   I keep going there, leaving notes stuck
10   into the door. I go back and the notes
11   are still there. I take the Maltese cross
12   cut it down from my car mirror, tie it
13   to her doorknob with a shoelace, leave
14   a book of poems.
15   when I go back the next night everything
16   is still there.


17   I keep searching the streets for that
18   blood-wine battleship she drives
19   with a weak battery, and the doors
20   hanging from broken hinges.


21   I drive around the streets
22   an inch away from weeping,
23   ashamed of my sentimentality and
24   possible love.

26   wondering where the good luck

        Bukowski, Charles :  /girls in pantyhose/ [from Love is a Dog
        from Hell: Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   schoolgirls in pantyhose
2   sitting on bus stop benches
3   looking tired at 13
4   with their raspberry lipstick.
5   it's hot in the sun
6   and the day at school has been
7   dull, and going home is
8   dull, and
9   I drive by in my car
10   peering at their warm legs.
11   their eyes look
12   away---
13   they've been warned
14   about ruthless and horny old
15   studs; they're just not going
16   to give it away like that.
17   and yet it's dull
18   waiting out the minutes on
19   the bench and the years at
20   home, and the books they
21   carry are dull and the food
22   they eat is dull, and even
23   the ruthless, horny old studs
24   are dull.


25   the girls in pantyhose wait,
26   they await the proper time and
27   moment, and then they will move
28   and then they will conquer.


29   I drive around in my car
30   peeking up their legs
31   pleased that I will never be
32   part of their heaven and
33   their hell. but that scarlet

[Page 204 ]


34   lipstick on those sad waiting
35   mouths! it would be nice to
36   kiss each of them once, fully,
37   then give them back.
38   but the bus will
39   get them first.

1   a woman told a man
2   when he got off a plane
3   that I was dead.
4   a magazine printed
5   the fact that I was dead
6   and somebody else said
7   that they'd heard that I
8   was dead, and then somebody
9   wrote an article and said
10   our Rimbaud our Villon is
11   dead. at the same time an old
12   drinking buddy published
13   a piece stating that I
14   could no longer write. a
15   real Judas job. they can't
16   wait for me to go, these
17   farts. well, I'm listening
18   to Tchaikovsky's piano
19   concerto number one and
20   the announcer said Mahler's
21   5th and 10th symphonies
22   are coming up via
23   Amsterdam,
24   and the beerbottles are
25   on the floor and ash
26   from my cigarettes
27   covers my cotton under-
28   wear and my gut, I've
29   told all my girlfriends to
30   go to hell, and even this
31   is a better poem than any
32   of those gravediggers
33   could write.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /artists:/ [from Love is a Dog from Hell:

1   she wrote me for years.
2   "I'm drinking wine in the kitchen.
3   it's raining outside. the children
4   are in school."


5   she was an average citizen
6   worried about her soul, her typewriter
7   and her
8   underground poetry reputation.


9   she wrote fairly well and with honesty
10   but only long after others had
11   broken the road ahead.


12   she'd phone me drunk at 2 a.m.
13   at 3 a.m.
14   while her husband slept.


15   "it's good to hear your voice," she'd
16   say.


17   "it's good to hear your voice too," I'd
18   say.


19   what the hell, you
20   know.


21   she finally came down. I think it had
22   something to do with
23   /The Chapparal Poets Society of California/ .
24   they had to elect officers. she phoned me
25   from their hotel.


26   "I'm here," she said, "we're going to elect
27   officers."

[Page 207 ]




28   "o.k., fine," I said, "get some good ones."


29   I hung up.


30   the phone rang again.
31   "hey, don't you want to see me?"


32   "sure," I said, "what's the address?"


33   after she said goodbye I jacked-off
34   changed my stockings
35   drank a half bottle of wine and
36   drove on out.


37   they were all drunk and trying to
38   fuck each other.


39   I drove her back to my place.


40   she had on pink panties with
41   ribbons.


42   we drank some beer and
43   smoked and talked about
44   Ezra Pound, then we
45   slept.


46   it's no longer clear to
47   me whether I drove her to
48   the airport or
49   not.


50   she still writes letters
51   and I answer each one
52   viciously
53   hoping to make her
54   stop.


55   someday she may luck into
56   fame like Erica

[Page 208 ]


57   Jong. (her face is not as good
58   but her body is better)
59   and I'll think,
60   my God, what have I done?
61   I blew it.
62   or rather: I didn't blow
63   it.


64   meanwhile I have her box number
65   and I'd better inform her
66   that my second novel will be out
67   in September.
68   that ought to keep her nipples hard
69   while I consider the possibility of
70   Francine du Plessix Gray.

1   I hear them outside:
2   "does he always type this
3   late?"
4   "no, it's very unusual."
5   "he shouldn't type this
6   late."
7   "he hardly ever does."

19   away and

1   this guy
2   he's got a crazy eye
3   and he's brown
4   a dark brown from the sun
5   the Hollywood and Western sun
6   the racetrack sun
7   he sees me and he says,
8   "hey, Hawley's leaving town
9   for a week. he messes up
10   my handicapping. now
11   I've got a chance."


12   he's grinning, he means it:
13   with Hawley out of town
14   he's going to move toward
15   that castle in the Hollywood Hills;
16   dancing girls
17   six German Shepherds
18   a drawbridge,
19   ten year old
20   wine.


21   Sam the Whorehouse Man
22   walks up and I tell Sam that
23   I am clearing $150 a day
24   at the track.
25   "I work right off the
26   toteboard," I tell him.
27   "I need a girl," he tells me,
28   "who can belt-buckle a guy
29   without coming out with all
30   this Christian moral bullshit
31   afterwards."


32   "Hawley's leaving town,"
33   I tell Sam.

[Page 211 ]


34   "where's the Shoe?"
35   he asks.
36   "back east," says an old man
37   who's standing there.
38   he has a white plastic shield
39   over his left eye
40   with little holes
41   punched into it.


42   "that leaves it all to Pinky,"
43   says dark brown.


44   we all stand looking at each
45   other.
46   then
47   a silent signal given
48   we turn away
49   and start walking,
50   each
51   in a different direction:
52   north south east west.


53   we know something.

1   they go on writing
2   pumping out poems---
3   young boys and college professors
4   wives who drink wine all afternoon
5   while their husbands work,
6   they go on writing
7   the same names in the same magazines
8   everybody writing a little worse each year,
9   getting out a poetry collection
10   and pumping out more poems
11   it's like a contest
12   it is a contest
13   but the prize is invisible.


14   they won't write short stories or articles
15   or novels
16   they just go on
17   pumping out poems
18   each sounding more and more like the others
19   and less and less like themselves,
20   and some of the young boys weary and quit
21   but the professors never quit
22   and the wives who drink wine in the afternoons
23   never ever ever quit
24   and new young boys arrive with new magazines
25   and there is some correspondence with lady or men poets
26   and some fucking
27   and everything is exaggerated and dull.


28   when the poems come back
29   they retype them
30   and send them off to the next magazine on the list,
31   and they give /readings/
32   all the readings they can
33   for free most of the time

[Page 213 ]


34   hoping that somebody will finally know
35   finally applaud them
36   finally congratulate and recognize their
37   talent
38   they are all so sure of their genius
39   there is so little self-doubt,
40   and most of them live in North Beach or New York City,
41   and their faces are like their poems:
42   alike,
43   and they know each other and
44   gather and hate and admire and choose and discard
45   and keep pumping out more poems
46   more poems
47   more poems
48   the contest of the dullards:
49   tap tap tap, tap tap, tap tap tap, tap tap ...

        Bukowski, Charles :  /the bee/ [from Love is a Dog from Hell:
        Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I suppose like any other boy
2   I had one best friend in the neighborhood.
3   his name was Eugene and he was bigger
4   than I was and one year older.
5   Eugene used to whip me pretty good.
6   we fought all the time.
7   I kept trying him but without much
8   success.


9   once we leaped off a garage roof together
10   to prove our guts.
11   I twisted my ankle and he came up clean
12   as freshly-wrapped butter.


13   I guess the only good thing he ever did for me
14   was when the bee stung me while I was barefoot
15   and while I sat down and pulled the stinger out
16   he said,
17   "I'll get the son of a bitch!"


18   and he did
19   with a tennis racket
20   plus a rubber hammer.


21   it was all right
22   they say they die
23   anyway.


24   my foot swelled up double-size
25   and I stayed in bed
26   praying for death


27   and Eugene went on to become an
28   Admiral or a Commander
29   or something large in the United States Navy

[Page 215 ]


30   and he passed through one or two wars
31   without injury.


32   I imagine him an old man now
33   in a rocking chair
34   with his false teeth
35   and glass of buttermilk ...


36   while drunk
37   I fingerfuck this 19 year old groupie
38   in bed with me.


39   but the worst part is
40   (like jumping off the garage roof)
41   Eugene wins again
42   because he's not even thinking
43   about me.

3   here comes nothing to do all day long
4   here comes another night of no sleep


5   here comes the phone ringing the wrong tone


6   here comes a termite with a banjo
7   here comes a flagpole with blank eyes
8   here comes a cat and a dog wearing nylons


9   here comes a machinegun singing
10   here comes bacon burning in the pan
11   here comes a voice saying something dull


12   here comes a newspaper stuffed with small red birds
13   with flat brown beaks


14   here comes a cunt carrying a torch
15   a grenade
16   a deathly love


17   here comes victory carrying
18   one bucket of blood
19   and stumbling over the berrybush


20   and the sheets hang out the windows


21   and the bombers head east west north south

26   one long line
27   one very long thin line
28   the longest line you could ever imagine

32   bare at last like the knife

7   to do is not to try.


8   but when the women aren't
9   around and the horses aren't
10   running
11   what else is there to do?


12   I've had a couple of
13   sexual fantasies
14   had lunch out
15   mailed three letters

17   nothing on tv.

23   8 hour day as they
24   drive in and park their cars
25   behind the apartment
26   next door.


27   I sit drinking German beer

29   big one
30   and I'm not going to make it.

32   more and more German beer
33   and rolling smokes

        Bukowski, Charles :  /the girl on the bus stop bench/ [from Love
        is a Dog from Hell: Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I saw her when I was in the left lane
2   going east on Sunset.
3   she was sitting
4   with her legs crossed
5   reading a paperback.
6   she was Italian or Indian or
7   Greek
8   and I was stopped at a red signal
9   as now and then a wind
10   would lift her skirt,
11   I was directly across from her
12   looking in,
13   and such perfect immaculate legs
14   I had never seen.
15   I am essentially bashful
16   but I stared and kept staring
17   until the person in the car behind
18   me honked.


19   it had never happened quite like that
20   before.
21   I drove around the block
22   and parked in the supermarket
23   lot
24   directly across from her
25   in my dark shades
26   I kept staring
27   like a schoolboy in his first
28   excitement.


29   I memorized her shoes
30   her dress
31   her stockings
32   her face.

[Page 221 ]


33   cars came by and blocked my
34   view.
35   then I saw her again.
36   the wind flipped her skirt
37   high along her thighs
38   and I began rubbing myself.
39   just before her bus came
40   I climaxed.
41   I smelled my sperm
42   felt it wet against my shorts
43   and pants.


44   it was an ugly white bus
45   and it took her away.


46   I backed out of the parking lot
47   thinking, I'm a peep-freak
48   but at least I didn't expose
49   myself.


50   I'm a peep-freak
51   but why do they do that?
52   why do they look like that?
53   why do they let the wind do
54   that?


55   when I got home
56   I undressed and bathed
57   got out
58   toweled
59   turned on
60   the news
61   turned off the news
62   and
63   wrote this poem.

1   I used to take the back off
2   the telephone and stuff it with rags
3   and when somebody knocked
4   I wouldn't answer and if they persisted
5   I'd tell them in terms vulgar
6   to vanish.


7   just another old crank
8   with wings of gold
9   flabby white belly
10   plus
11   eyes to knock out
12   the sun.

1   I had to take a shit
2   but instead I went
3   into this shop to
4   have a key made.
5   the woman was dressed
6   in gingham and smelled
7   like a muskrat.
8   "Ralph," she hollered
9   and an old swine in a
10   flowered shirt and
11   size 6 shoes, her
12   husband, came out and
13   she said, " this man
14   wants a key."
15   he started grinding
16   as if he really didn't
17   want to.
18   there were slinking
19   shadows and urine
20   in the air.
21   I moved along the
22   glass counter,
23   pointed and called
24   to her,
25   "here, I want this
26   one.
27   she handed it to
28   me: a switchblade
29   in a light purple
30   case.
31   $6.50 plus tax.
32   the key cost
33   practically
34   nothing.
35   I got my change and

36   walked out on
37   the street.
38   sometimes you need
39   people like that.

        [from Love is a Dog from Hell: Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black
        Sparrow Press ]



1   I had this room in front on DeLongpre
2   and I used to sit for hours
3   in the daytime
4   looking out the front
5   window.
6   there were any number of girls who would
7   walk by
8   swaying;
9   it helped my afternoons,
10   added something to the beer and the
11   cigarettes.


12   one day I saw something
13   extra.
14   I heard the sound of it first.
15   "come on, push!" he said.
16   there was a long board
17   about 2½ feet wide and
18   8 feet long;
19   nailed to the ends and in the middle
20   were roller skates.
21   he was pulling in front
22   two long ropes attached to the board
23   and she was in back
24   guiding and also pushing.
25   all their possessions were tied to the
26   board:
27   pots, pans, bedquilts, and so forth
28   were roped to the board
29   tied down;
30   and the skatewheels were grinding.


31   he was white, red-necked, a
32   southerner---

[Page 226 ]


33   thin, slumped, his pants about to
34   fall from his
35   ass---
36   his face pinked by the sun and
37   cheap wine,
38   and she was black
39   and walked upright
40   pushing;
41   she was simply beautiful
42   in turban
43   long green ear rings
44   yellow dress
45   from
46   neck to
47   ankle.
48   her face was gloriously
49   indifferent.


50   "don't worry!" he shouted, looking back
51   at her, "somebody will
52   rent us a place!"


53   she didn't answer.


54   then they were gone
55   although I still heard the
56   skatewheels.


57   they're going to make it,
58   I thought.


59   I'm sure they
60   did.

1   the roaches spit out
2   paperclips
3   and the helicopter circles and circles
4   smelling for blood
5   searchlights leering down into our
6   bedroom


7   5 guys in this court have pistols
8   another a
9   machete
10   we are all murderers and
11   alcoholics
12   but there are worse in the hotel
13   across the street
14   they sit in the green and white doorway
15   banal and depraved
16   waiting to be institutionalized


17   here we each have a small green plant
18   in the window
19   and when we fight with our women at 3 a.m.
20   we speak
21   softly
22   and on each porch
23   is a small dish of food
24   always eaten by morning
25   we presume
26   by the
27   cats.

1   they took my man off the street
2   the other day
3   he wore an L.A. Rams sweatshirt with
4   the sleeves cut
5   off
6   and under that
7   an army shirt
8   private first class
9   and he wore a green beret
10   walked very straight
11   he was black in brown walking shorts
12   hair dyed blonde
13   he never bothered anybody
14   he stole a few babies
15   and ran off cackling
16   but he always returned the infants
17   unharmed
18   he slept in the back of the
19   Love Parlor
20   the girls let him.
21   compassion is found in
22   strange places.


23   one day I didn't see him
24   then another.
25   I asked around.


26   my taxes are going to go up
27   again. the state's got to
28   house and feed
29   him. the cops took him
30   in. no
31   good.

1   feet of cheese
2   coffeepot soul
3   hands that hate poolsticks
4   eyes like paperclips
5   I prefer red wine
6   I am bored on airliners
7   I am docile during earthquakes
8   I am sleepy at funerals
9   I puke at parades
10   and am sacrificial at chess
11   and cunt and caring
12   I smell urine in churches
13   I can no longer read
14   I can no longer sleep

37   and circled by the Long Beach Marching Band
38   at 3:36 p.m.


39   there is a ticking behind me
40   but no clock
41   I feel something crawling along
42   the left side of my nose:
43   memories of airliners


44   my mother had false teeth
45   my father had false teeth
46   and every Saturday of their lives
47   they took up all the rugs in their house
48   waxed the hardwood floors
49   and covered them with rugs again


50   and Nina is in England

1   I read last Saturday in the
2   redwoods outside of Santa Cruz
3   and I was about 3/4's finished
4   when I heard a long high scream
5   and a quite attractive
6   young girl came running toward me
7   long gown & divine eyes of fire
8   and she leaped up on the stage
9   and screamed: "I WANT YOU!
10   I WANT YOU! TAKE ME! TAKE
11   ME!"
12   I told her, "look, get the hell
13   away from me."
14   but she kept tearing at my
15   clothing and throwing herself
16   at me.
17   "where were you," I
18   asked her, "when I was living
19   on one candy bar a day and
20   sending short stories to the
21   Atlantic Monthly?"
22   she grabbed my balls and almost
23   twisted them off. her kisses
24   tasted like shitsoup.
25   2 women jumped up on the stage
26   and
27   carried her off into the
28   woods.
29   I could still hear her screams
30   as I began the next poem.


31   maybe, I thought, I should have
32   taken her on the stage in front
33   of all those eyes.

35   whether it's good poetry or

        writing, he asked, what would you tell them?/ [from Love is a
        Dog from Hell: Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I'd tell them to have an unhappy love
2   affair, hemorrhoids, bad teeth
3   and to drink cheap wine,
4   avoid opera and golf and chess,
5   to keep switching the head of their
6   bed from wall to wall
7   and then I'd tell them to have
8   another unhappy love affair
9   and never to use a silk typewriter
10   ribbon,
11   avoid family picnics
12   or being photographed in a rose
13   garden;
14   read Hemingway only once,
15   skip Faulkner
16   ignore Gogol
17   stare at photos of Gertrude Stein
18   and read Sherwood Anderson in bed
19   while eating Ritz crackers,
20   realize that people who keep
21   talking about sexual liberation
22   are more frightened than you are.
23   listen to E. Power Biggs work the
24   organ on your radio while you're
25   rolling Bull Durham in the dark
26   in a strange town
27   with one day left on the rent
28   after having given up
29   friends, relatives and jobs.
30   never consider yourself superior and/
31   or fair
32   and never try to be.
33   have another unhappy love affair.

[Page 234 ]


34   watch a fly on a summer curtain.
35   never try to succeed.
36   don't shoot pool.
37   be righteously angry when you
38   find your car has a flat tire.
39   take vitamins but don't lift weights or jog.


40   then after all this
41   reverse the procedure.
42   have a good love affair.
43   and the thing
44   you might learn
45   is that nobody knows anything---
46   not the State, nor the mice
47   the garden hose or the North Star.
48   and if you ever catch me
49   teaching a creative writing class
50   and you read this back to me
51   I'll give you a straight A
52   right up the pickle
53   barrel.

1   a house with 7 or 8 people
2   living in it
3   getting up the rent.
4   there's a stereo never used
5   and a set of bongos
6   never used
7   and there are rugs over the
8   windows
9   and you smoke
10   as the living roaches
11   stumble over buttons on your
12   shirt and tumble
13   off.


14   it's dark and somebody sends
15   out for food. you eat the food
16   and sleep. everybody sleeps at
17   once: on floors, coffeetables,
18   couches, beds, in bathtubs. there's
19   even one in the brush outside.


20   then somebody wakes up and
21   says, "come on, let's roll
22   one!"


23   a few others wake up.
24   "sure. yea. o.k."


25   "all right. come on, somebody
26   roll a couple. let's get it
27   on!"


28   "yeah! let's get it on!"


29   we smoke a few joints and then
30   we're asleep again

[Page 236 ]


31   except we reverse positions:
32   bathtub to couch, coffeetable to
33   rug, bed to floor, and a new one
34   falls into the brush
35   outside, and they haven't yet
36   found Patty Hearst and Tim doesn't
37   want to speak to
38   Allan.

1   the guy in the front court can't
2   speak English, he's Greek, a
3   rather stupid-looking and
4   fairly ugly man.


5   now my landlord does some painting,
6   it's not very good.


7   he showed the Greek one of his paintings.


8   the Greek went out and purchased
9   paper, brushes, paints.


10   the Greek started painting in his front
11   court. he leaves the paintings outside to
12   dry.


13   the Greek had never painted before---
14   here it comes:
15   a blue guitar
16   a street
17   a horse.


18   he's good
19   in his mid-forties he's
20   good.
21   he's found a
22   toy.
23   he's happy
24   now.


25   then I think, I wonder if he will get
26   very good?
27   and I wonder if I will have to watch
28   the rest?

1   Shirley came to town with a broken leg
2   and met the Chicano who smoked
3   long slim cigars
4   and they got a place together
5   on Beacon street
6   5th floor;
7   the leg didn't get in the way
8   too much and
9   they watched television together
10   and Shirley cooked, on her
11   crutches and all;
12   there was a cat, Bogey,
13   and they had some friends
14   and talked about sports and Richard Nixon
15   and how the hell to
16   make it.
17   it worked for some months,
18   Shirley even got the cast off,
19   and the Chicano, Manuel,
20   got a job at the Biltmore,
21   Shirley sewed all the buttons back on
22   Manuel's shirts, mended and matched his
23   socks, then
24   one day Manuel returned to the place, and
25   she was gone---
26   no argument, no note, just
27   gone, all her clothes
28   all her stuff, and
29   Manuel sat by the window and looked out
30   and didn't make his job
31   the next day or the
32   next day or
33   the day after, he
34   didn't phone in, he
35   lost his job, got a

[Page 244 ]


36   ticket for parking, smoked
37   four hundred and sixty cigarettes, got
38   picked up for common drunk, bailed
39   out, went
40   to court and pleaded
41   guilty.


42   when the rent was up he
43   moved from Beacon street, he
44   left the cat and went to live with
45   his brother and
46   they'd get drunk
47   every night
48   and talk about how
49   terrible
50   life was.


51   Manuel never again smoked
52   long slim cigars
53   because Shirley always said
54   how
55   handsome he looked
56   when he did.

1   I've always had trouble with

3   this one place I worked
4   everybody ate hot dogs
5   and potato chips
6   in the company cafeteria for
7   3 days before each
8   payday.
9   I wanted steaks,
10   I even went to see the manager
11   of the cafeteria and
12   demanded that he serve
13   steaks. he refused.


14   I'd forget payday.
15   I had a high rate of absenteeism and
16   payday would arrive and everybody would
17   start talking about
18   it.
19   "payday?" I'd say, "hell, is this
20   payday? I forgot to pick up my
21   last cheek ..."


22   "stop the bullshit, man ..."


23   "no, no, I mean it ..."


24   I'd jump up and go down to payroll
25   and sure enough there'd be a
26   check and I'd come back and show it
27   to them. "Jesus Christ, I forgot all about
28   it ..."


29   for some reason they'd get
30   angry. then the payroll clerk would come

[Page 246 ]


31   around. I'd have two
32   checks. "Jesus," I'd say, "two checks."
33   and they were
34   angry.
35   some of them were working
36   two jobs.

38   it was raining very hard,
39   I didn't have a raincoat so
40   I put on a very old coat I hadn't worn for
41   months and
42   I walked in a little late
43   while they were working.
44   I looked in the coat for some
45   cigarettes
46   and found a 5 dollar bill
47   in the side pocket:
48   "hey, look," I said, "I just found a 5 dollar
49   bill I didn't know I had, that's
50   funny."


51   "hey, man, knock off the
52   shit!"


53   "no, no, I'm /serious/ , really, I remember
54   wearing this coat when
55   I got drunk at the
56   bars. I've been rolled too often,
57   I've got this fear ... I take money out of
58   my wallet and hide it all
59   over me."


60   "sit down and get to
61   work."


62   I reached into an inside pocket:
63   "hey, look, here's a TWENTY! God, here's a
64   TWENTY I never knew I

[Page 247 ]


65   had! I'm
66   RICH!"


67   "you're not funny, son of
68   a bitch ..."


69   "hey, my God, here's ANOTHER
70   twenty! too much, too too
71   much ... I /knew/ I didn't spend all that
72   money that night. I thought I'd been
73   rolled again ..."


74   I kept searching the
75   coat. "hey! here's a ten and
76   here's a fiver! my God ..."


77   "listen, I'm telling you to /sit down/
78   /and shut up ..."/


79   "my God, I'm RICH ... I don't even /need/
80   this job ..."


81   "man, sit /down/ ..."


82   I found another ten after I sat down
83   but I didn't say
84   anything.
85   I could feel waves of hatred and
86   I was confused,
87   they believed I had
88   plotted the whole thing
89   just to make them
90   feel bad. I didn't want
91   to. people who live on hot dogs and
92   potato chips for
93   3 days before payday
94   feel bad
95   enough.

[Page 248 ]




96   I sat down
97   leaned forward and
98   began to go to
99   work.


100   outside
101   it continued to
102   rain.

1   my daughter is most
2   glorious.
3   we are eating a take-
4   out snack in my car
5   in Santa Monica.
6   I say, "hey, kid,
7   my life has been
8   good, so good."
9   she looks at me.
10   I put my head down
11   on the steering wheel,
12   shudder, then I
13   kick the door open,
14   put on a
15   mock-puke.
16   I straighten up.
17   she laughs
18   biting into her
19   sandwich.
20   I pick up four
21   french fries
22   put them into my mouth,
23   chew them.
24   it's 5:30 p.m.
25   and the cars run up
26   and down past us.
27   I sneak a look:
28   we've got all the
29   luck we need:
30   her eyes are brilliant with the
31   remainder of the
32   day, and she's
33   grinning.

1   my friend is worried about dying


2   he lives in Frisco
3   I live in L.A.


4   he goes to the gym and
5   works with the iron and hits
6   the big bag.


7   old age diminishes him.


8   he can't drink because of
9   his liver.


10   he can do
11   50 pushups.


12   he writes me
13   letters
14   telling me
15   that I'm the only one
16   who listens to him.


17   sure, Hal, I answer him
18   on a postcard.


19   but I don't want to pay
20   all those gym fees.


21   I go to bed
22   with a liverwurst and
23   onion sandwich at
24   one p.m.


25   after I eat I
26   nap

2   when this girl of about 15
3   dressed in tight blue jeans
4   that grip her behind like two hands
5   steps out in front of my car
6   I stop to let her cross the street
7   and as I watch her contours waving
8   she looks directly through my windshield
9   at me
10   with purple eyes

12   out of her mouth
13   the largest pink globe of

16   while I am listening to Beethoven

3   but by the time I got there
4   it was too late.


5   damn it, I said, you girls

7   I've already masturbated
8   twice today.


9   that wasn't his problem,
10   she said. by the way,
11   how come you flog-off
12   so much?


13   it's the space, I said,
14   all that space between
15   poems and stories, it's
16   intolerable.


17   you should wait, she said,
18   you're impatient.


19   what do you think of Celine?
20   I asked.


21   I wanted to ball him too.


22   dead now, I said.


23   dead now, she said.


24   care to hear a little

1   hey, said my friend, I want you to meet
2   Hangdog Harry, he reminds me of you,
3   and I said, all right, and we went to
4   this cheap hotel.
5   old men sitting around watching
6   some program on the tv in the lobby
7   as we went up the stairway
8   to 209 and there was Hangdog
9   sitting in a straight strawback chair
10   bottle of wine at his feet
11   last year's calendar on the wall,
12   "you guys sit down," he said,
13   "that's the problem:
14   man's inhumanity to man."
15   we watched him slowly roll a
16   Bull Durham cigarette.
17   "I've got a 17 inch neck and I'll kill
18   anybody who fucks with me."
19   he licked his cigarette
20   then spit on the rug.
21   "just like home here. feel free."


22   "how you feeling, Hangdog?" asked
23   my friend.


24   "terrible. I'm in love with a whore,
25   haven't seen her in 3 or 4 weeks."


26   "what you think she's doing, Hang?"


27   "well, right now about now I'd say
28   she's sucking some turkeyneck."


29   he picked up his wine bottle
30   took a tremendous drain.

[Page 258 ]




31   "look," my friend said to Hangdog,
32   "we've got to get going."


33   "o.k., time and tide, they don't
34   wait ..."


35   he looked at me:
36   "whatcha say your name was?"


37   "Salomski."


38   "pleased to meet cha, kid."


39   "likewise."


40   we went down the stairway
41   they were still in the lobby
42   looking at t.v.


43   "what did you think of him?"
44   my friend asked.


45   "shit," I said, "he was really
46   all right. yes."

1   she had huge thighs
2   and a very good laugh
3   she laughed at everything
4   and the curtains were yellow
5   and I finished
6   rolled off
7   and before she went to the bathroom
8   she reached under the bed and
9   threw me a rag.
10   it was hard
11   it was stiff with other men's
12   sperm.
13   I wiped off on the sheet.


14   when she came out
15   she bent over
16   and I saw all that behind
17   as she put Mozart
18   on.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /the little girls/ [from Love is a Dog from
        Hell: Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   up in northern California
2   he stood in the pulpit
3   and had been reading for some time
4   he had been reading poems about
5   nature and the goodness
6   of man.


7   he knew that everything was all
8   right and you couldn't blame him:
9   he was a professor and had never
10   been in jail or in a whorehouse
11   had never had a used car die
12   in a traffic jam;
13   had never needed more than
14   3 drinks during his wildest
15   evening;
16   had never been rolled, flogged,
17   mugged,
18   had never been bitten by a dog
19   he got nice letters from Gary
20   Snyder, and his face was
21   kindly, unmarked and
22   tender.
23   his wife had never betrayed him,
24   nor had his luck.


25   he said, "I'm just going to read
26   3 more poems and then I'm going
27   to step down and let
28   Bukowski read."


29   "oh no, William," said all the
30   little girls in their pink and blue
31   and white and orange and lavender
32   dresses, "oh no, William,

[Page 261 ]


33   read some more, read some
34   more!"


35   he read one more poem and then he said,
36   "this will be the last poem that
37   I will read."


38   "oh no, William," said all the little
39   girls in their red and green see-
40   through dresses, "oh no, William," said
41   all the little girls in their tight blue
42   jeans with little hearts sewn on them,
43   "oh no, William," said all the little girls,
44   "read more poems, read more poems!"


45   but he was good to his word.
46   he got the poem out and he climbed down and
47   vanished. as I got up to read
48   the little girls wiggled in
49   their seats and some of them hissed and
50   some of them made remarks to me
51   which I will use at some later date.


52   two or three weeks later
53   I got a letter from William
54   saying that he /did/ enjoy my reading.
55   a true gentleman.
56   I was in bed in my underwear with a
57   3 day hangover. I lost the envelope
58   but I took the letter and folded it
59   into a paper airplane such as
60   I had learned to make in grammar
61   school. it sailed about the room
62   before landing between an old Racing Form
63   and a pair of shit-stained shorts.


64   we have not corresponded since.

        Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   eating cold plums in bed
2   she told me about the German
3   who owned everything on the block
4   except the custom drapery shop
5   and he tried to buy
6   the custom drapery shop
7   but the girls said, no.
8   the German had the best grocery store in
9   Pasadena, his meats were high
10   but worth the price
11   and his vegetables and produce were
12   very cheap and
13   he also sold flowers. people came
14   from all over Pasadena to go to his
15   store
16   but he wanted to buy the custom drapery shop
17   and the girls kept saying, no.
18   one night somebody was seen running
19   out the back door of the drapery shop
20   and there was a fire
21   and almost everything was destroyed---
22   they'd had a tremendous inventory,
23   they tried to save what was left
24   had a fire sale
25   but it didn't work
26   they had to sell, finally,
27   and then the German owned the drapery shop
28   but it just sits there, vacant,
29   the German's wife tried to make a go of it
30   she tried to sell little baskets and things
31   but it didn't work.


32   we finished the plums.
33   "that was a sad story," I told her.
34   then she bent down and began sucking me off.

36   hollering all over the neighborhood

4   there's a girl in a red dress
5   driving a white car
6   there's a girl in a blue dress
7   driving a blue car
8   there's a girl in a pink dress
9   driving a red car.


10   as the girl in the red dress
11   gets out of the white car
12   I look at her legs


13   as the girl in the blue dress
14   gets out of the blue car
15   I look at her legs
16   as the girl in the pink dress
17   gets out of the red car
18   I look at her legs.


19   the girl in the red dress
20   who got out of the white car
21   had the best legs


22   the girl in the pink dress
23   who got out of the red car
24   had average legs

1   which reminds me
2   I shacked with Jane for 7 years
3   she was a drunk
4   I loved her


5   my parents hated her
6   I hated my parents
7   we made a nice
8   foursome


9   one day we went on a picnic
10   together
11   up in the hills
12   and we played cards and drank beer and
13   ate potato salad


14   they treated her as if she were a living person
15   at last


16   everybody laughed
17   I didn't laugh.


18   later at my place
19   over the whiskey
20   I said to her,
21   I don't like them
22   but it's good they treated you
23   nice.


24   you damn fool, she said,
25   don't you see?


26   see what?


27   they kept looking at my beer-belly,

[Page 268 ]


28   they think I'm pregnant.


29   oh, I said, well here's to our beautiful
30   child.


31   here's to our beautiful child,
32   she said.


33   we drank them down.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /bedpans/ [from Love is a Dog from Hell:
        Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   in the hospitals I've been in
2   you see the crosses on the walls
3   with the thin palm leaves behind them
4   yellowed and browned


5   it is the signal to accept the inevitable


6   but what really hurts
7   are the bedpans
8   hard under your ass
9   you're dying
10   and you're supposed to sit up on this
11   impossible thing
12   and urinate and
13   defecate


14   while in the bed
15   next to yours
16   a family of 5 brings good cheer
17   to an incurable
18   heart-case
19   cancer-case
20   or a case of general rot.


21   the bedpan is a merciless rock
22   a horrible mockery
23   because nobody wants to drag your failing body
24   to the crapper and back.


25   you'd drag it
26   but they've got the bars up:
27   you're in your crib
28   your tiny death-crib
29   and when the nurse comes back
30   an hour and a half later

[Page 270 ]


31   and there's nothing in the bedpan
32   she gives you a most
33   intemperate look


34   as if when nearing death
35   one should be able to do
36   the common common things
37   again and again.


38   but if you think that's bad
39   just relax
40   and let it go
41   all of it
42   into the sheets


43   then you'll hear it
44   not only from the nurse
45   but from
46   all the other patients ...



47   the hardest part of dying
48   is that they expect you
49   to go out
50   like a rocket shot into the
51   night sky.


52   sometimes that can be done


53   but when you need the bullet and the gun
54   you'll look up
55   and find
56   that the wires above your head
57   connected to the button
58   years ago
59   have been cut
60   snipped
61   eliminated
62   been

[Page 271 ]


63   made
64   useless as
65   the bedpan.

1   all the way from Mexico
2   straight from the fields
3   to 14 wins
4   13 by k.o.
5   he was ranked #3
6   and in a tune-up fight
7   he was k.o'd by an unranked
8   black fighter who hadn't fought
9   in 2 years.


10   all the way from Mexico
11   straight from the fields
12   the drink and the women had gotten
13   to him.
14   in the rematch he was k.o'd again
15   and suspended for 6 months.


16   all that way
17   for the bottle and 2 cases of
18   v.d.


19   he came back in a year
20   swearing he was clean, he'd
21   learned.
22   and he earned a draw with the
23   9th ranked in his division.


24   he came back for the rematch
25   and the fight was stopped in
26   the 3rd round because he
27   couldn't protect
28   himself.


29   and he went all the way back
30   to Mexico
31   straight to the fields.

32   it takes a damned good poet
33   like me
34   to handle drink and women
35   evade v.d.
36   write about failures
37   like him
38   and hold my ranking in the
39   top 10:
40   all the way from Germany
41   straight from the factories
42   among beerbottles
43   and the ringing of the
44   phone.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /the girls at the green hotel/ [from Love

1   are more beautiful than
2   movie stars
3   and they lounge on the
4   lawn
5   sunbathing
6   and one sits in a short
7   dress and high
8   heels, legs crossed
9   exposing miraculous
10   thighs.
11   she has a bandanna
12   on her head
13   and smokes a
14   long cigarette.
15   traffic slows
16   almost stops.


17   the girls ignore
18   the traffic.
19   they are half
20   asleep in the afternoon
21   they are whores
22   they are whores without
23   souls
24   and they are magic
25   because they lie
26   about nothing.


27   I get in my car
28   wait for traffic to
29   clear,
30   drive across the street
31   to the green hotel
32   to my favorite:

[Page 277 ]




33   she is
34   sun-bathing on the
35   lawn nearest the
36   curb.


37   "hello," I say.
38   she turns eyes like
39   imitation diamonds
40   up at me.
41   her face has no
42   expression.


43   I drop my latest
44   book of poems
45   out the car
46   window.
47   it falls
48   by her side.


49   I shift into
50   low,
51   drive off.


52   there'll be some
53   laughs
54   tonight.

1   I get too many
2   phone calls.
3   they seek the
4   creature out.
5   they shouldn't.


6   I never phoned
7   Knut Hamsun or
8   Ernie or
9   Celine.


10   I never phoned
11   Salinger
12   I never phoned
13   Neruda.


14   tonight I got
15   a call:


16   "hello. you
17   Charles Bukowski?"


18   "yes."


19   "well, I got a
20   house."


21   "yes?"


22   "a bordello."


23   "I understand."


24   "I've read your
25   books. I've got a

[Page 279 ]


26   houseboat in
27   Sausalito."


28   "all right."


29   "I want to give you
30   my phone number. you
31   ever come to San Francisco
32   I'll buy you a drink."


33   "o.k. give me the
34   number."


35   I took it down.


36   "we run a class joint. we're
37   after lawyers and state senators,
38   upper class citizens, muggers,
39   pimps, the like."


40   "I'll phone you when I
41   get up there."


42   "lots of the girls
43   read your books. they
44   love you."


45   "yeah?"
46   "yeah."


47   we said goodbye.


48   I liked that
49   phone call.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /shit time/ [from Love is a Dog from Hell:
        Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   half drunk
2   I left her place
3   her warm blankets
4   and I was hungover
5   didn't even know what town
6   it was.
7   I walked along and
8   I couldn't find my car.
9   but I knew it was somewhere.
10   and then I was lost
11   too.
12   I walked around. it was a
13   Wednesday morning and I could
14   see the ocean to the south.
15   but all that drinking:
16   the shit was about to pour
17   out of me.
18   I walked towards the
19   sea.
20   I saw a brown brick
21   structure at the edge
22   of the sea.
23   I walked in. there was an
24   old guy groaning on one of
25   the pots.
26   "hi, buddy," he said.
27   "hi," I said.
28   "it's hell out there,
29   isn't it?" the old guy
30   asked.
31   "it is," I answered.
32   "need a drink?"
33   "never before noon."
34   "what time you got?"
35   "11:58."
36   "we got two minutes."

[Page 281 ]


37   I wiped, flushed, pulled up my
38   pants and walked over.
39   the old man was still on his pot,
40   groaning.
41   he pointed to a bottle of wine
42   at his feet
43   it was almost done
44   and I picked it up and took about
45   half what remained.
46   I handed him a very old and wrinkled
47   dollar
48   then walked outside on the lawn
49   and puked it up.
50   I looked at the ocean and the
51   ocean looked good, full of blues and
52   greens and sharks.
53   I walked back out of there
54   and down the street
55   determined to find my automobile.
56   it took me one hour and 15 minutes
57   and when I found it
58   I got in and drove off
59   pretending that I knew just as much
60   as the next
61   man.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /madness/ [from Love is a Dog from Hell:
        Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I don't beat the walls with my fists
2   I just sit
3   but it rushes in
4   a tide of it.


5   the woman in the court behind me howls,
6   weeps every night.
7   sometimes the county comes
8   and takes her away for a day or two.


9   I believed she was suffering the loss
10   of a great love
11   until one day she came over and told me about
12   it---
13   she had lost 8 apartment houses
14   to a gigolo who had swindled her out
15   of them.
16   she was howling and weeping over loss of property.
17   she began weeping as she told me
18   then with a mouth lined with stale lipstick
19   and smelling of garlic and onions
20   she kissed me and told me:
21   "Hank, nobody loves you if you don't have money."


22   she's old, almost as old as I am.


23   she left, still weeping ...



24   the other morning at 7:30 a.m. two black
25   attendants came with their stretcher,
26   only they knocked on my door.


27   "come on, man," said the tallest
28   one.

[Page 283 ]




29   "wait," I said, "there's a mistake."


30   I was terribly hungover
31   standing in my torn bathrobe
32   hair hanging down over my eyes.


33   "this is the address they gave us, man,
34   this is 5437 and 2/5's isn't it?"


35   "yes."


36   "come on, man, don't give us no shit."


37   "the lady you want is in the back there."


38   they both walked around back.


39   "this door here?"


40   "no, no, that's my back door. look go up those steps behind
41   you there. it's the door to the east, the one with the mailbox
42   hanging loose."


43   they went up and banged on the door. I watched them take her
44   away. they didn't use the stretcher. she walked between them.
45   and the thought occurred to me that they were taking the wrong
46   one but I wasn't sure.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /a 56 year old poem/ [from Love is a Dog
        from Hell: Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I went with two ladies
2   down to Venice
3   to look for antique furniture.
4   I parked in back of the store
5   and went in with them.
6   $125 for a clock, $700 for 6 chairs.
7   I stopped looking.


8   the ladies moved around
9   looking at everything.
10   the ladies had class.
11   I waved goodbye to one of the ladies
12   and walked out.


13   it was Sunday and the bar
14   wasn't much better,
15   everybody was nervous and young
16   and blonde and pale.
17   I finished my drink, got 4 beers
18   at the liquor store
19   and sat in my car drinking them.


20   finishing the 4th beer
21   the ladies came out.
22   they asked me if I was all right.
23   I told them that every experience
24   meant something
25   and that they had pulled me out of
26   my usual murky
27   current.


28   the one I knew best had bought a table
29   with a marble top for $100.
30   she owned her own business and was a
31   civilized person.

[Page 285 ]




32   she was civilized enough to know a neighbor
33   who had a van
34   and while I sat in her apartment drinking
35   1974 /Zeller Schwarze Katz/
36   they went down and got the table.


37   later she wanted to know what I thought about
38   the table and I said I thought it was all right,
39   sometimes I lost one hundred dollars at the
40   racetrack. we watched tv in bed and later
41   that night I couldn't come. I think it was
42   because I was thinking about that marble table.
43   I'm sure it was. I don't have any antique marble
44   tables at my place, I almost never have any sex trouble at
45   my place. sometimes but
46   very seldom.
47   I don't understand the whole antique
48   business


49   I'm sure it's a giant
50   con.

        graveyard/ --- [from Love is a Dog from Hell: Poems, 1974-1977
        (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I stop my car at the signal
2   I see her walking past the graveyard---


3   as she walks past the iron fence
4   I can see through the iron fence
5   and I see the headstones
6   and the green lawn.


7   her body moves in front of the iron fence
8   the headstones do not move.


9   I think,
10   doesn't anybody else see this?


11   I think,
12   does she see those headstones?


13   if she does
14   she has wisdom that I don't have
15   for she appears to ignore them.


16   her body moving in its
17   magic fluid
18   and her long hair is lighted
19   by the 3 p.m. sun.


20   the signal changes
21   she crosses the street to the west
22   I drive west.


23   I drive my car down to the ocean
24   get out
25   and run up and down
26   in front of the sea for 35 minutes

[Page 287 ]


27   seeing people here and there
28   with eyes and ears and toes
29   and various other parts.


30   nobody seems to care.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /beer/ [from Love is a Dog from Hell:
        Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I don't know how many bottles of beer
2   I have consumed while waiting for things
3   to get better.
4   I don't know how much wine and whiskey
5   and beer
6   mostly beer
7   I have consumed after
8   splits with women---
9   waiting for the phone to ring
10   waiting for the sound of footsteps,
11   and the phone never rings
12   until much later
13   and the footsteps never arrive
14   until much later.
15   when my stomach is coming up
16   out of my mouth
17   they arrive as fresh as spring flowers:
18   "what the hell have you done to yourself?
19   it will be 3 days before you can fuck me!"


20   the female is durable
21   she lives seven and one half years longer
22   than the male, and she drinks very little beer
23   because she knows it's bad for the
24   figure.


25   while we are going mad
26   they are out
27   dancing and laughing
28   with horny cowboys.


29   well, there's beer
30   sacks and sacks of empty beer bottles
31   and when you pick one up
32   the bottles fall through the wet bottom

[Page 289 ]


33   of the paper sack
34   rolling
35   clanking
36   spilling grey wet ash
37   and stale beer,
38   or the sacks fall over at 4 a.m.
39   in the morning
40   making the only sound in your life.


41   beer
42   rivers and seas of beer
43   beer beer beer
44   the radio singing love songs
45   as the phone remains silent
46   and the walls stand
47   straight up and down
48   and beer is all there is.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /artist/ [from Love is a Dog from Hell:
        Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   all of a sudden I'm a painter.
2   a girl from Galveston gives me
3   $50 for a painting of a man
4   holding a candycane while
5   floating in a darkened sky.


6   than a young man with a black beard
7   comes over
8   and I sell him three for $80.
9   he likes rugged stuff
10   where I write across the painting---
11   "shoot shit" or "GRATE ART IS
12   HORSESHIT, BUY TACOS."


13   I can do a painting in 5 minutes.
14   I use acrylics, paint right out of
15   the tube.
16   I do the left side of the painting
17   first with my left hand and then
18   finish the right side with my
19   right hand.


20   now the man with the black beard
21   comes back with a friend whose hair
22   sticks out and they have a young blonde
23   girl with them.


24   black beard is still a sucker:
25   I sell him a hunk of shit---
26   an orange dog with the word
27   "DOG" written on his side.


28   stick-out hair wants 3 paintings
29   for which I ask $70.
30   he doesn't have the money.

[Page 291 ]




31   I keep the paintings but
32   he promises to send me a
33   girl called Judy
34   in garter belt and high heels.
35   he's already told her about me:
36   "a world-renowned writer," he said
37   and she said, "oh no!" and pulled
38   her dress up over her head.
39   "I want that," I told him.


40   then we haggled over terms
41   I wanted to fuck her first
42   then get head later.
43   "how about head first and
44   fuck later?" he asked.


45   "that doesn't work," I
46   said.


47   so we agreed:
48   Judy will come by and
49   afterwards
50   I will hand her the
51   3 paintings.
52   so there we are:
53   back to the barter system,
54   the only way to beat
55   inflation.


56   never the less,
57   I'd like to
58   start the Men's Liberation Movement:
59   I want a woman to hand /me/ 3 of her
60   paintings after I have
61   made love to her,
62   and if she can't paint
63   she can leave me
64   a couple of golden earrings
65   or maybe a slice of ear
66   in memory of one who
67   could.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /my old man/ [from Love is a Dog from Hell:
        Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   16 years old
2   during the depression
3   I'd come home drunk
4   and all my clothing---
5   shorts, shirts, stockings---
6   suitcase, and pages of
7   short stories
8   would be thrown out on the
9   front lawn and about the
10   street.


11   my mother would be
12   waiting behind a tree:
13   "Henry, Henry, don't
14   go in ... he'll
15   kill you, he's read
16   your stories ..."


17   "I can whip his
18   ass ..."


19   "Henry, please take
20   this ... and
21   find yourself a room."


22   but it worried him
23   that I might not
24   finish high school
25   so I'd be back
26   again.


27   one evening he walked in
28   with the pages of
29   one of my short stories
30   (which I had never submitted

[Page 293 ]


31   to him)
32   and he said, "this is
33   a great short story."
34   I said, "o.k.,"
35   and he handed it to me
36   and I read it.
37   it was a story about
38   a rich man
39   who had a fight with
40   his wife and had
41   gone out into the night
42   for a cup of coffee
43   and had observed
44   the waitress and the spoons
45   and forks and the
46   salt and pepper shakers
47   and the neon sign
48   in the window
49   and then had gone back
50   to his stable
51   to see and touch his
52   favorite horse
53   who then
54   kicked him in the head
55   and killed him.


56   somehow
57   the story held
58   meaning for him
59   though
60   when I had written it
61   I had no idea
62   of what I was
63   writing about.


64   so I told him,
65   "o.k., old man, you can
66   have it."

[Page 294 ]




67   and he took it
68   and walked out
69   and closed the door.
70   I guess that's
71   as close
72   as we ever got.

1   he walks up to my Volks
2   after I have parked
3   and rocks it back and
4   forth
5   grinning around his
6   cigar.


7   "hey, Hank, I notice
8   all the women around your
9   place lately ... good looking
10   stuff; you're doing all
11   right."


12   "Sam," I say, "that's not
13   true; I am one of God's most
14   lonely men."


15   "we got some nice girls at
16   the parlor, you oughta try
17   some of them."


18   "I'm afraid of those places,
19   Sam, I can't walk into them."


20   "I'll send you a girl then,
21   real nice stuff."


22   "Sam, don't send me a whore,
23   I always fall in love with
24   whores."


25   "o.k., friend," he says,
26   "let me know if you change
27   your mind."

[Page 296 ]




28   I watch him walk away.
29   some men are always on
30   top of their game.
31   I am mostly always
32   confused.


33   he can break a man
34   in half
35   and doesn't know who
36   Mozart is.


37   who wants to listen
38   to music
39   anyhow
40   on a rainy Wednesday
41   night?

1   Sam the whorehouse man
2   has squeaky shoes
3   and he walks up and down
4   the court
5   squeaking and talking to
6   the cats.
7   he's 310 pounds,
8   a killer
9   and he talks to the cats.
10   he sees the women at the massage
11   parlor and has no girlfriends
12   no automobile
13   he doesn't drink or dope
14   his biggest vices are
15   chewing on a cigar and
16   feeding all the cats in
17   the neighborhood.
18   some of the cats get
19   pregnant
20   and so finally there are
21   more and more cats and
22   everytime I open my door
23   one or two cats will
24   run in and sometimes I'll
25   forget they are there and

27   or I'll awaken at night
28   hearing sounds
29   leap up with my blade
30   sneak into the kitchen and
31   find one of Sam the whorehouse
32   man's cats walking around on
33   the sink or sitting on top
34   of the refrigerator.

[Page 298 ]




35   Sam runs the love parlor
36   around the corner
37   and his girls stand in the
38   doorway in the sun
39   and the traffic signals go
40   red and green and red and green
41   and all of Sam's cats
42   possess some of the meaning
43   as do the days and the nights.

1   "... I've seen people in front of
2   their typewriters in such a bind
3   that it would blow their intestines
4   right out of their assholes if they
5   were trying to shit."


6   "ah hahaha hahaha!"


7   "... it's a shame to work /that/
8   hard to try to write."


9   "ah hahaha hahaha!"


10   "ambition rarely has anything to
11   do with talent. luck is best, and
12   talent limps along a little
13   bit behind luck."


14   "ah haha."


15   he rose and left with an 18 year old virgin, the most
16   beautiful co-ed of them
17   all.
18   I closed my notebook
19   got up and limped a
20   little bit behind
21   them.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /about cranes/ [from Love is a Dog from
        Hell: Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   sometimes after you get your ass
2   kicked real good by the forces


3   you often wish you were a crane
4   standing on one leg


5   in blue water


6   but there's
7   the
8   old up-bringing
9   you know:


10   you don't want to be
11   a crane
12   standing on one leg


13   in blue water


14   the distress is not
15   enough


16   and


17   the victory
18   limps


19   a crane can't
20   buy a piece of ass


21   or


22   hang itself at noon
23   in Monterey

[Page 301 ]




24   those are some of
25   the things


26   humans can do


27   besides
28   stand on one leg

        Bukowski, Charles :  /a gold pocket watch/ [from Love is a Dog
        from Hell: Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   my grandfather was a tall German
2   with a strange smell on his breath.
3   he stood very straight
4   in front of his small house
5   and his wife hated him
6   and his children thought him odd.
7   I was six the first time we met
8   and he gave me all his war medals.
9   the second time I met him
10   he gave me his gold pocket watch.
11   it was very heavy and I took it home
12   and wound it very tight
13   and it stopped running
14   which made me feel bad.
15   I never saw him again
16   and my parents never spoke of him
17   nor did my grandmother
18   who had long ago
19   stopped living with him.
20   once I asked about him
21   and they told me
22   he drank too much
23   but I liked him best
24   standing very straight
25   in front of his house
26   and saying, "hello, Henry, you
27   and I, we know each
28   other."

        Bukowski, Charles :  /beach trip/ [from Love is a Dog from Hell:
        Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the strong men
2   the muscle men
3   there they sit
4   down at the beach
5   cocoa tans
6   with the weights
7   scattered about them
8   untouched


9   they sit as the
10   waves go in and
11   out


12   they sit as the
13   stock market
14   makes and breaks
15   men and families


16   they sit while
17   one punch of a button
18   could turn their
19   turkeynecks to
20   black and shriveled
21   matchsticks


22   they sit while
23   suicides in green rooms
24   trade it in for space


25   they sit while former
26   Miss Americas
27   weep before wrinkled
28   mirrors


29   they sit

[Page 304 ]


30   they sit with less
31   life-flow than apes
32   and my woman stops and
33   looks at them:
34   "oooh oooh oooh," she
35   says.


36   I walk off with
37   my woman as the waves
38   go in and out.


39   "there's something wrong
40   with them," she said, "what
41   is it?"


42   "their love only runs in
43   one direction."


44   the seagulls whirl and
45   the sea runs in and out


46   and we left them
47   back there
48   wasting themselves
49   time
50   this moment
51   the seagulls
52   the sea
53   the sand.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /one for the shoeshine man/ [from Love is a
        Dog from Hell: Poems, 1974-1977 (1977) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the balance is preserved by the snails climbing the
2   Santa Monica cliffs;
3   the luck is in walking down Western Avenue
4   and having the girls in a massage
5   parlor holler at you, "Hello, Sweetie!"
6   the miracle is having 5 women in love
7   with you at the age of 55,
8   and the goodness is that you are only able
9   to love one of them.
10   the gift is having a daughter more gentle
11   than you are, whose laughter is finer
12   than yours.
13   the peace comes from driving a
14   blue 67 Volks through the streets like a
15   teenager, radio tuned to The Host Who Loves You
16   Most, feeling the sun, feeling the solid hum
17   of the rebuilt motor
18   as you needle through traffic.
19   the grace is being able to like rock music,
20   symphony music, jazz ...
21   anything that contains the original energy of
22   joy.


23   and the probability that returns
24   is the deep blue low
25   yourself flat upon yourself
26   within the guillotine walls
27   angry at the sound of the phone
28   or anybody's footsteps passing;
29   but the other probability---
30   the lilting high that always follows---
31   makes the girl at the checkstand in the
32   supermarket look like
33   Marilyn
34   like Jackie before they got her Harvard lover

[Page 306 ]


35   like the girl in high school that we
36   all followed home.


37   there is that which helps you believe
38   in something else besides death:
39   somebody in a car approaching
40   on a street too narrow,
41   and he or she pulls aside to let you
42   by, or the old fighter Beau Jack
43   shining shoes
44   after blowing the entire bankroll
45   on parties
46   on women
47   on parasites,
48   humming, breathing on the leather,
49   working the rag
50   looking up and saying:
51   "what the hell, I had it for a
52   while. that beats the
53   other."


54   I am bitter sometimes
55   but the taste has often been
56   sweet. it's only that I've
57   feared to say it. it's like
58   when your woman says,
59   "tell me you love me," and
60   you can't.


61   if you see me grinning from
62   my blue Volks
63   running a yellow light
64   driving straight into the sun
65   I will be locked in the
66   arms of a
67   crazy life
68   thinking of trapeze artists
69   of midgets with big cigars
70   of a Russian winter in the early 40's
71   of Chopin with his bag of Polish soil

[Page 307 ]


72   of an old waitress bringing me an extra
73   cup of coffee and laughing
74   as she does so.


75   the best of you
76   I like more than you think.
77   the others don't count
78   except that they have fingers and heads
79   and some of them eyes
80   and most of them legs
81   and all of them
82   good and bad dreams
83   and a way to go.


84   justice is everywhere and it's working
85   and the machine guns and the frogs
86   and the hedges will tell you
87   so.

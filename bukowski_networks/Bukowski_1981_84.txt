        Bukowski, Charles :  some of my readers [from War All the Time:
        Poems, 1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I liked it coming out of that expensive
2   cafe in Germany
3   that rainy night
4   some of the ladies had learned that I
5   was in there
6   and as I walked out well-fed and
7   intoxicated
8   the ladies waved
9   placards
10   and screamed at me
11   but all I recognized was my
12   name.


13   I asked a German friend what they were
14   saying.


15   "they hate you," he told me,
16   "they belong to the German Female
17   Liberation Movement ..."


18   I stood and watched them, they were
19   beautiful and screaming, I
20   loved them all, I laughed, waved,
21   blew them kisses.


22   then my friend, my publisher and my
23   girlfriend got me into the car; the
24   engine started, the windshield wipers
25   began thrashing
26   and as we drove off in the rain
27   I looked back
28   watched them standing in that
29   terrible weather
30   waving their placards and their
31   fists.


32   it was nice to be recognized
33   in the country of my birth, that

[Page 12 ]


34   was what mattered
35   most ...

                    



36   back at the hotel room
37   opening bottles of wine
38   with my friends


39   I missed them,
40   those angry wet
41   passionate ladies
42   of the night.

        Bukowski, Charles :  talking to my mailbox ... [from War All the
        Time: Poems, 1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   boy, don't come around here telling me you
2   can't cut it, that
3   they're pitching you low and inside, that
4   they are conspiring against you,
5   that all you want is a chance but they won't
6   give you a
7   chance.


8   boy, the problem is that you're not doing
9   what you want to do, or
10   if you're doing what you want to do, you're
11   just not doing it
12   well.


13   boy, I agree:
14   there's not much opportunity, and there are
15   some at the top who are
16   not doing much better than you
17   are
18   but
19   you're wasting energy haranguing and
20   bitching.


21   boy, I'm not /advising/ , just suggesting that
22   instead of sending your poems to me
23   along with your letters of
24   complaint
25   you should enter the
26   arena---
27   send your work to the editors and
28   publishers, it will
29   buck up your backbone and your
30   versatility.


31   boy, I wish to thank you for the
32   praise for some of my
33   published works
34   but that

[Page 14 ]


35   has nothing to do with
36   anything and won't help a
37   purple shit, you've just got to
38   learn to hit that low, hard
39   inside pitch.


40   this is a form letter
41   I send to almost everybody, but
42   I hope you take it
43   personally,
44   man.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the last generation [from War All the Time:
        Poems, 1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   it was much easier to be a genius in the twenties, there were
2   only 3 or 4 literary magazines and if you got into them
3   4 or 5 times you could end up in Gertie's parlor
4   you could possibly meet Picasso for a glass of wine, or
5   maybe only Miró.


6   and yes, if you sent your stuff postmarked from Paris
7   chances of publication became much better.
8   most writers bottomed their manuscripts with the
9   word "Paris" and the date.


10   and with a patron there was time to
11   write, eat, drink and take drives to Italy and sometimes
12   Greece.
13   it was good to be photo'd with others of your kind
14   it was good to look tidy, enigmatic and thin.
15   photos taken on the beach were great.


16   and yes, you could write letters to the 15 or 20
17   others
18   bitching about this and that.


19   you might get a letter from Ezra or from Hem; Ezra liked
20   to give directions and Hem liked to practice his writing
21   in his letters when he couldn't do the other.


22   it was a romantic grand game then, full of the fury of
23   discovery.


24   now


25   now there are so many of us, hundreds of literary magazines,
26   hundreds of presses, thousands of titles.


27   who is to survive out of all this mulch?
28   it's almost improper to ask.


29   I go back, I read the books about the lives of the boys

[Page 16 ]


30   and girls of the twenties.
31   if they were the Lost Generation, what would you call us?
32   sitting here among the warheads with our electric-touch
33   typewriters?


34   the Last Generation?


35   I'd rather be Lost than Last but as I read these books about
36   /them/
37   I feel a gentleness and a generosity


38   as I read of the suicide of Harry Crosby in his hotel room
39   with his whore
40   that seems as real to me as the faucet dripping now
41   in my bathroom sink.


42   I like to read about /them/ : Joyce blind and prowling the
43   bookstores like a tarantula, they said.
44   Dos Passos with his clipped newscasts using a pink type-
45   writer ribbon.
46   D. H. horny and pissed-off, H. D. being smart enough to use
47   her initials which seemed much more literary than Hilda
48   Doolittle.


49   G. B. Shaw, long established, as noble and
50   dumb as royalty, flesh and brain turning to marble. a
51   bore.


52   Huxley promenading his brain with great glee, arguing
53   with Lawrence that it wasn't in the belly and the balls,
54   that the glory was in the skull.


55   and that hick Sinclair Lewis coming to light.


56   meanwhile
57   the revolution being over, the Russians were liberated and
58   dying.
59   Gorky with nothing to fight for, sitting in a room trying

[Page 17 ]


60   to find phrases praising the government.
61   many others broken in victory.


62   now


63   now there are so many of us
64   but we should be grateful, for in a hundred years
65   if the world is not destroyed, think, how much
66   there will be left of all of this:
67   nobody really able to fail or to succeed---just
68   relative merit, diminished further by
69   our numerical superiority.
70   we will all be catalogued and filed.
71   all right ...


72   if you still have doubts of those other golden
73   times
74   there were other curious creatures: Richard
75   Aldington, Teddy Dreiser, F. Scott, Hart Crane, Wyndham
76   Lewis, the
77   Black Sun Press.


78   but to me, the twenties centered mostly on Hemingway
79   coming out of the war and beginning to type.


80   it was all so simple, all so deliciously clear


81   now


82   there are so many of us.


83   Ernie, you had no idea how good it had been
84   four decades later when you blew your brains into
85   the orange juice


86   although
87   I grant you
88   that was not your best work.


[Page 18 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  windy night [from War All the Time: Poems,
        1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   they smile and bring the food
2   they smile and bow
3   as a light hurricane rattles the
4   blinds


5   as the scarlet ibis appears
6   and dances in the guano
7   on my plate


8   I'm not hungry anyhow


9   Leda, Tyndareus, Clytemnestra,
10   Castor, Pollux or anybody else
11   I know wouldn't
12   eat this stuff.


13   I ask for a doggy bag.
14   they smile and scoop the meal
15   into there.


16   later in my kitchen I divide
17   the meal onto their plates
18   place them upon the floor


19   as my 3 cats remain motionless
20   staring up at me
21   as I ask them, "What's the matter?
22   What's the matter? Eat it!"


23   the hurricane scratches
24   branches against the window
25   as I switch out the kitchen
26   light
27   walk out of there and into
28   the other room
29   switch on the tv
30   just as a cop shoots a
31   man at the top of a fire escape

[Page 19 ]


32   and he falls and falls
33   toppling and flattening in the
34   street:


35   he will never have to eat
36   Szechwan shrimp with Chinese
37   peas
38   again.

        Bukowski, Charles :  here I am [from War All the Time: Poems,
        1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   drunk at 3 a.m. at the bottom of my 2nd bottle
2   of wine, I have typed from a dozen to 15 pages of
3   poesy
4   an old man
5   maddened for the flesh of young girls in this
6   dwindling twilight
7   liver gone
8   kidneys going
9   pancreas pooped
10   top-floor blood pressure


11   while the fear of wasted years
12   laughs between my toes
13   no woman will live with me
14   no Florence Nightingale to watch
15   over me.


16   if I have a stroke I will lay here for six
17   days, my three cats hungrily ripping the flesh
18   from my legs, wrists, head


19   the radio playing classical music.


20   I promised myself never to write old man poems
21   but this one's funny, you see, excusable, be-
22   cause there's
23   still more left
24   here at 3 a.m. and I am going to take this sheet from
25   the typer
26   pour another glass and
27   insert another
28   make love to the fresh new whiteness


29   maybe get lucky
30   again


31   first for
32   me

[Page 21 ]




33   later
34   for you.

        Bukowski, Charles :  training for Kid Aztec [from War All the
        Time: Poems, 1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I was a young guy in Los Angeles.
2   there were little bars
3   around the Plaza, small Mexican
4   bars, and there was one large
5   one, well-frequented, and I
6   started the night out there
7   but it was too mellow
8   full of decent working types
9   so I got out
10   found a winding little alley,
11   dark
12   and I followed it down
13   switchblade in pocket until
14   I found this little bar
15   at the alley's end
16   went in
17   sat on a stool and ordered a
18   bottle of beer.
19   there were 4 Mexicans in there
20   including the bartender
21   and I sat looking straight
22   ahead
23   lifting my beer now and
24   then.


25   I was a crazy son of a bitch
26   ready to go all the way
27   better not fuck
28   with me ...


29   I finished the bottle
30   ordered another.


31   "where the hell are the
32   women?" I asked.


33   no answer.

[Page 23 ]




34   "I shouldn't be in here,"
35   I said, "I'm training for a
36   fight at the Olympic, a four-
37   rounder, I'm fighting Kid
38   Aztec ..."


39   silence.


40   I got off my stool, stood
41   up, sneered, "anybody here want
42   to spar a little, huh?"


43   no answer.


44   I put a coin in the
45   juke box.
46   the music came on and
47   I shadow boxed to
48   it.


49   when the piece was
50   finished I sat down and
51   ordered another beer.


52   "I'm a killer," I told
53   the barkeep, "a born
54   killer ... I'm sorry for
55   Kid Aztec ..."


56   the barkeep took my
57   money, rang it into the
58   register
59   his back to me.


60   I said to his
61   back: "on top of
62   everything, I'm a writer.

[Page 24 ]




63   I write short stories,
64   novels, poems,
65   essays ..."


66   "Señor, you write
67   poems?" asked a big
68   Mexican at the end of the
69   bar.


70   "shit, yes ..."


71   "what do you write these
72   poems about?"


73   "love ..."


74   "oh, /love/ , Señor?"


75   "love poems to
76   Death ..."


77   I drained my bottle,
78   ordered another.


79   " /I/ write too,
80   Señor ..."


81   "oh yeah?"


82   "oh yes, I stick my pencil into
83   women and I write
84   inside of them."


85   the other Mexicans
86   laughed.
87   I waited until they were
88   finished.

[Page 25 ]




89   "you guys are /fools/ , you
90   laugh like /fools/ !"


91   "maybe so, Señor, but even fools
92   have a right to laugh,
93   no?"


94   I peeled the label off
95   my beer, stuck it face down on
96   the bar, finished
97   off the bottle.


98   "another beer, Señor?" asked
99   the barkeep.


100   "naw, that's enough, I got to
101   get my rest ..."


102   I walked toward the
103   exit.


104   "good luck with your fight with
105   Kid Aztec, Señor," somebody
106   said.

                    



107   I walked up the little
108   alley, stopped to puke in a
109   dark corner, finished, walked
110   out on the street
111   looking for a poem, a better
112   bar, something,
113   anything.


114   I had only bored them with
115   my dangerousness.

[Page 26 ]


116   all the nights were the
117   same and the days were
118   worse.


119   I stood under a tree at
120   the edge of the Plaza
121   lighting a cigarette and
122   trying to look like a
123   killer.


124   nobody noticed.


125   maybe they never
126   would.


127   I had held the match
128   too long, it burned my
129   fingers.
130   I cursed loudly, stepped
131   out and began walking
132   toward the train
133   station


134   somebody had told me
135   that the hookers were
136   sucking them off right on the
137   loading ramps ...

        Bukowski, Charles :  Sparks [from War All the Time: Poems,

1   the factory off Santa Fe Ave. was
2   best.
3   we packed heavy lighting fixtures into
4   long heavy boxes
5   then flipped the boxes into stacks
6   six high.
7   then the loaders would
8   come by
9   clear your table and
10   you'd go for the next six.


11   ten hour day
12   four on Saturday
13   the pay was union
14   pretty good for unskilled labor
15   and if you didn't come in
16   with muscles
17   you got them soon enough


18   most of us in
19   white t-shirts and jeans
20   cigarettes dangling
21   sneaking beers
22   management looking
23   the other way


24   not many whites
25   the whites didn't last:
26   lousy workers
27   mostly Mexicans and
28   blacks
29   cool and mean


30   now and then
31   a blade flashed
32   or somebody got
33   punched-out

[Page 28 ]




34   management looking
35   the other way


36   the few whites who lasted
37   were crazy


38   the work got done
39   and the young Mexican girls
40   kept us
41   cheerful and hoping
42   their eyes flashing
43   messages
44   from the
45   assembly line.


46   I was one of the
47   crazy whites
48   who lasted
49   I was a good worker
50   just for the rhythm of it
51   just for the hell of it
52   and after ten hours
53   of heavy labor
54   after exchanging insults
55   living through skirmishes
56   with those not cool enough to
57   abide
58   we left
59   still fresh


60   we climbed into our old
61   automobiles to
62   go to our places
63   to drink half the night
64   to fight with our women


65   to return the next morning
66   to punch in

[Page 29 ]




67   knowing we were
68   suckers
69   making the rich
70   richer


71   we swaggered
72   in our white t-shirts and
73   jeans
74   gliding past
75   the young Mexican girls


76   we were mean and perfect
77   for what we were
78   hungover
79   we could
80   damn well
81   do the job


82   but
83   it didn't touch us
84   ever


85   those filthy peeling walls


86   the sound of drills and
87   cutting blades


88   the sparks


89   we were some gang
90   in that death ballet


91   we were magnificent


92   we gave them
93   better than they asked


94   yet

[Page 30 ]




95   we gave them
96   nothing.

1   I told her then in bed
2   after flying all the way
3   down there
4   I told her in bed
5   afterwards,
6   "there's no going back,
7   you know, it's too god
8   damned bad ..."


9   and it was
10   although I stayed 2 or
11   3 days
12   and then she drove me
13   to the airport
14   the dog was in the
15   back seat
16   that dog who had lived
17   with us
18   those few
19   years.


20   I got out
21   told her
22   "don't come in,"
23   the dog jumped up
24   and down,
25   he knew I was going,
26   I roughed him up,
27   he slobbered across
28   my face.
29   what crap.
30   I leaned in
31   holding my bag,
32   she gave me a little
33   goodbye kiss,
34   then I turned and
35   walked into the
36   airport office

[Page 32 ]


37   up to the counter
38   got out the
39   other half of the round-trip
40   ticket.


41   "smoking or non-
42   smoking?" the clerk
43   asked.


44   "drinking," I
45   said.


46   I got my boarding pass
47   and walked toward
48   the gate
49   feeling bad


50   for everybody
51   I knew


52   didn't know


53   would
54   know.

1   all the women
2   all their kisses the
3   different ways they love and
4   talk and need.


5   their ears they all have
6   ears and
7   throats and dresses
8   and shoes and
9   automobiles and ex-
10   husbands.


11   mostly
12   the women are very
13   warm they remind me of
14   buttered toast with the butter
15   melted
16   in.


17   there is a look in the
18   eye: they have been
19   taken they have been
20   fooled. I don't quite know what to
21   do for
22   them.


23   I am
24   a fair cook a good
25   listener
26   but I never learned to
27   dance---I was busy
28   then with larger things.


29   but I've enjoyed their different
30   beds
31   smoking cigarettes
32   staring at the
33   ceilings. I was neither vicious nor

[Page 34 ]


34   unfair. only
35   a student.


36   I know they all have these
37   feet and barefoot they go across the floor as
38   I watch their bashful buttocks in the
39   dark. I know that they like me, some even
40   love me
41   but I love very
42   few.


43   some give me oranges and vitamin pills;
44   others talk quietly of
45   childhood and fathers and
46   landscapes; some are almost
47   crazy but none of them are without
48   meaning; some love
49   well, others not
50   so; the best at sex are not always the
51   best in other
52   ways; each has limits as I have
53   limits and we learn
54   each other
55   quickly.


56   all the women all the
57   women all the
58   bedrooms
59   the rugs the
60   photos the
61   curtains, it's
62   something like a church only
63   at times there's
64   laughter.


65   those ears those
66   arms those
67   elbows those eyes

1   I park, get out, lock the car, it's a perfect day, warm and
2   easy, I feel all right, I begin walking toward the track
3   entrance and a little fat guy joins me, he walks at my side,
4   I don't know where he came from.
5   "hi," he says, "how you doing?"
6   "o.k.," I say.
7   he says, "I guess you don't remember me. you've seen me before,
8   maybe two or three times."
9   "maybe so," I say, "I'm at the track every day."
10   "I come maybe three or four times a month," he says.
11   "with your wife?" I ask.
12   "oh no," he says, "I never bring my wife."
13   we walk along and I walk faster; he struggles to keep up.


14   "who you like in the first?" he asks.
15   I tell him that I haven't gotten the Form yet.


16   "where do you sit?" he asks.
17   I tell him that I sit in a different place every time.


18   "that God-damned Gilligan," he says, "is the worst jock
19   at the track. lost a bundle on him the other day. why
20   do they use him?"
21   I tell him Whittingham and Longden think he's all
22   right.
23   "sure, they're friends," he answers. "I know something about
24   Gilligan. want to hear it?"
25   I tell him to forget it.


26   we are nearing the newspaper stands near the entrance
27   and I slant off toward the left as if I were going to buy
28   a paper.
29   "good luck," I tell him and drift off.
30   he appears startled, his eyes go into shock; he reminds me
31   of some women who only feel secure when somebody's thumb is
32   up their ass.

[Page 37 ]


33   he looks about, spots a grey-haired old man with a
34   limp, rushes up, catches stride with the old guy and begins
35   talking to him ...


        II

Being alone has always been very necessary to me. At one time I
was on a hot winning streak at the racetrack. The money just
came to me. A certain basic simple system was working for me.
The horses moved south and I walked off my job and followed
them down to Del Mar.

It was a good life. I'd win each day at the track. I had a routine.
After the track I'd stop off at the liquor store for my fifth of
whiskey and my six-pack of beer and the cigars. Then I'd get
back into the car and cruise the coast for a motel, park, carry in
my stuff, shower, change clothes and then get my ass back into
the car and cruise the coast again---this time for an eating place.
And what I would look for was an eating place without people in
it. (The worst, I know.) But I didn't like crowds. I always found
one. Went in and ordered.

So, this particular night, I found a place, went in, sat at the
counter, ordered: porterhouse with french fries, beer. Everything
was fine. The waitress didn't bother me. I sucked at my beer,
ordered another. Then the meal came. God damn, it looked
good. I began. I had a few fine bites, then the door opened and
this fellow came in. There were 14 empty stools at the counter.
This fellow sat down next to /me/ .

"Hi, Doris, how's it going?"

"O.k., Eddie. How ya doing?"

"Fine."

"What'll ya have, Eddie?"

"Oh, just a coffee, I guess ..."

Doris brought Eddie his coffee.

"I think the fuel pump on my car is going out ..."

"Always some damn thing, huh Eddie?"

"Yeah, now my wife needs new plates, Doris."

"You mean houseware?"



[Page 38 ]

"I mean mouthware!"

"Oh, Eddie, ha, ha, ha!"

"Well," Eddie said, "when it rains it pours!"

I picked up my plate and my beer, my fork, my knife, my
spoon, my napkin, my ass and moved it all over to a far booth. I
sat down and began again. As I did I watched Eddie and Doris.
They were whispering. Then Doris looked at me:

"Is everything all right, sir?"

"Now," I told her, "it is."




        III


55   a fat Mexican woman in front of me in line
56   lays down her last two dollars all in change:
57   quarters, dimes and nickles
58   as she calls the wrong number.
59   I walk up, bet twenty win and call the
60   wrong number also as
61   a fart of thunder erupts in the sky followed
62   by a distant light
63   small drops of rain begin their work and we
64   go out and watch the last race:
65   12 three-year-olds at a flat mile, non-winners
66   of two races
67   they break in a spill of color and chance
68   fight for position on the quick turn
69   enter the backstretch before the enchanting
70   mountains
71   there's still a chance for everybody
72   except that the 6 horse snaps a front
73   foreleg and
74   tosses a millionaire called Pincay to the
75   hard hard ground as
76   some of the poor groan for him
77   others don't care
78   and a few are secretly delighted.
79   the track ambulance circles counter-

[Page 39 ]


80   clockwise
81   the race unfolds unfolds
82   as 3 contenders straighten out for the
83   stretch drive
84   the favorite gives way
85   falls back
86   as the 2nd favorite and a 26-to-one shot
87   drive to the wire as a single 8-legged creature,
88   the last head bob in the photo belonging to
89   the longshot.
90   most of us tear up our tickets and begin our
91   walk toward the parking lot and whatever is
92   left over for us
93   the hot drops of rain increase
94   become cold
95   all we hope for now is that our automobiles
96   might still be there
97   as Pincay regains consciousness in the track
98   infirmary and asks, "what the hell
99   happened?"


        IV

I have a saying, "You will find the lowest of the breed at the
racetrack." I am there almost every day working on my various
systems, waiting the long 30 minutes between races. I don't
know how many of those 30 minute waits I have given away
over the years sitting there waiting for a race that is generally
over in a minute and nine seconds. And at the quarter horse
races most are finished in 17 seconds plus a tick.

A racetrack never has a losing day. For each dollar bet they
give back about 84 cents. In Mexico they give back 75 cents. At
some of the European tracks they give back 50 cents. It doesn't
matter, the people continue to play. Check the faces at any
track going into the last race. You will see the story.

When I came out of the Charity Ward of the L.A. County
General Hospital in 1955 after drinking ten years without

[Page 40 ]


missing a night or a day (except while in jail) they told me that if
I ever took another drink I would be dead. I went back to my
shack job and I asked her, "What the hell am I going to do
now?"

"We'll play the horses," she said.

"Horses?"

"Yeah, they run and you bet on them."

She had found some money on the boulevard. We went out. I
had 3 winners, one of them paid over 50 bucks. It seemed very
easy.

We went a second time and I won again.

That night I decided that if I mixed some wine with milk that
it might not hurt me. I tried a glass, half wine, half milk. I didn't
die. The next glass I tried a little less milk and a little more wine.
By the time the night was over I was drinking straight wine. In
the morning I got up without hemorrhaging. After that I drank
/and/ played the horses. 27 years later I am still doing both. Time
is made to be wasted.

109   my women of the past keep trying to locate me.
110   I duck into dark closets and pull the overcoats
111   about.


112   at the racetrack I sit in my clubhouse seat
113   smoking cigarette after cigarette
114   watching the horses come out for the post parade
115   and looking over my shoulder.


116   I go to bet---this one's ass looks like that one's
117   ass used to.
118   I duck away from her.


119   that one's hair might have her under it.
120   I get the hell out of the clubhouse and go
121   to the grandstand to bet.

[Page 41 ]




122   I don't want a return of any of the past.
123   I don't want a return of any of those glorious
124   ladies of my past,
125   I don't want to try again, I don't want to see
126   them again even in silhouette;
127   I gave them all, gave all of them to all the other
128   men in the world, they can have the darlings,
129   the tits the asses the thighs the minds
130   and their mothers and fathers and sisters and
131   brothers and children and dogs and x-boy friends
132   and present boy friends, they can have them and
133   fuck them and hang them
134   upsidedown.


135   I was a terrible and a jealous man who mistreated
136   them and it's best that they are with you
137   for you will be better to them and I will be
138   better to myself
139   and when they phone me or write me or leave
140   messages
141   I will send them all to you
142   my fine fellows


143   I don't deserve what you have and I want to
144   keep it that way.


        VI



145   got to the track early to study my figures and here's this
146   man coming by
147   dusting seats. he keeps at his work, dusting away,
148   probably glad to have his job.
149   I'm one of those who doesn't think there is much difference
150   between an atomic scientist and a man who cleans the crappers
151   except for the luck of the draw---
152   parents with enough money to point you toward a more
153   generous death.

[Page 42 ]


154   of course, some come through brilliantly, but
155   there are thousands, millions of others, bottled up, kept
156   from even the most minute chance to realize their
157   potential.


158   "how's it going?" I asked him as he dusted by.


159   "o.k., how about you?" he asked.


160   "I do all right on the horses. it's the women where I lose."


161   he laughed. "yeah. a man can have two or three bad experiences,
162   it can really set him back."


163   "I wouldn't mind two or three," I told him. "I've had
164   eleven or twelve."


165   "man, you must know something. who do you like in the first?"


166   I told him that the entry, which was reading 4-to-one should
167   finish one-two. (45 minutes later it did.) but it wasn't 45
168   minutes later. he went dusting off and I thought of all the
169   rotten jobs and how glad I had been to have them. for a
170   while. then it was always a matter of quitting or getting fired
171   and both felt good.


172   when you sleep and live with the same woman for over two
173   years you know what's finally going to happen only you don't know
174   why. it's not in the charts. it's in past performance
175   but it's not in the charts.


176   my friend, dusting off the track, he didn't know either.


177   I got up and walked over for a coffee. the girl behind the
178   counter was a slim brunette with a tiny blue flower in her hair,
179   nice eyes, nice smile. I paid for my coffee.
180   "good luck," she said.

[Page 43 ]




181   "you too," I said.


182   I took my coffee back to my seat, the wind came from the west,
183   I took a sip off the top and waited for the action, thinking of
184   many things, too many things. it just went into the grass and
185   trees and dirt out there, one mile, the dirty shades in
186   dirty rooming houses flapping back and forth in a light wind,
187   torn, the dirty troops entering the new village,
188   and all my old girl friends unhappy again with their new men.


189   I sat back and drank my coffee and waited for the first
190   race.


        VII



191   I am at the track
192   and go up to bet
193   ten win on the four
194   horse
195   somebody hollers,
196   "HEY!"
197   I look up.
198   a teller 3 windows
199   down is looking
200   at me and
201   smiling.
202   he's a young fellow
203   in a white shirt
204   smiling away.
205   I walk up to him.
206   "how the hell you
207   been doing?" he
208   asks.
209   "o.k.," I say,
210   "how's it been
211   with you?"

[Page 44 ]




212   "fine," he says
213   and reaches
214   out.
215   we shake hands.
216   "well," I tell
217   him, "stay in
218   there!"
219   "you too!" he
220   grins.


221   I turn and walk
222   off, thinking,
223   who was that?


224   then I see a
225   young girl with
226   long legs.
227   she is wearing a
228   beret.


229   unusual.
230   I follow
231   her.


        VIII



232   I pay my way in, find a seat far from everybody, sit down.
233   I have seven or eight good quiet minutes, then I hear a
234   movement: a young man has seated himself near me, not next
235   to me but one seat away, although there are hundreds of
236   empty seats elsewhere.
237   another Mickey Mouse, I think. why do they always need
238   me?
239   I keep working at my figures.
240   then I hear his voice: "Blue Baron will take the first
241   race."
242   I make a note to scratch that dog and then I look up and

[Page 45 ]


243   it seems that this remark is directed to me: there's
244   nobody else within fifty yards.
245   I see his face.
246   he has a face women would love: utterly bland and
247   blank.
248   he has remained untouched by circumstance,
249   a miracle of zero.
250   even I gaze on him, enchanted:
251   it's like looking at an endless lake of milk
252   never rippled by even a pebble.


253   I look back down at my Form.


254   "who do you like?" he asks.


255   "sir," I tell him, "I'd prefer not to talk."


256   he looks at me from behind his perfectly trimmed black moustache,
257   there is not one hair longer than the other or out of place;
258   I've tried moustaches; I've never cared enough for mirrors
259   to keep something that unnatural.


260   he says, "my buddy told me about you. he says you don't talk
261   to anybody."


262   I get up, take my papers three rows down and sixteen seats
263   over, I take out my set
264   of red rubber earplugs, jam them in.


265   I feel for the lonely, I sense their need, but I also feel
266   that they should all
267   comfort each other and leave me alone.


268   so, plugs in, I miss the flag raising ceremony, being deep
269   into the Form.


270   I would like to be human
271   if they would only let me.

[Page 46 ]



        IX


272   I had been up until 3 a.m. the night before.
273   heavy drinking: beer, vodka, wine
274   and there I was at the track
275   on a Sunday.
276   it was hot.
277   everybody was there.
278   the killers, the lovers, the fools.
279   the brother of Jesus Christ.
280   the uncle of Mickey Mouse.
281   there were 50,000 of them.
282   the track was giving away
283   free caps
284   and 45,000 of those people were
285   wearing caps
286   and there weren't enough seats
287   and the crappers were crowded
288   and during the races
289   the people screamed so loud
290   that you couldn't hear
291   the announcer and
292   the lines were so long
293   it took you
294   20 minutes to lay a bet and
295   in between running to the crapper
296   and trying to bet
297   it was a day you
298   would rather begin
299   all over again
300   someplace else
301   but it was too late and
302   there were elbows and assholes every-
303   where and
304   all the women looked dumb and ugly and
305   all the men looked stupid and ugly
306   and suddenly
307   I got a vision of

[Page 47 ]


308   the whole mass of them copulating
309   in the infield
310   like death blasting death with
311   stinking and stale semen.
312   they were walking all around
313   belching, farting
314   bumping into each other
315   stinking
316   losing
317   lost
318   hating the dream
319   for not working ...


        X


320   I've been going to the track for years
321   and tonight between the 6th and 7th races
322   I was in the men's crapper
323   at Los Alamitos
324   and this man walked in with a
325   corned beef on rye.
326   he walked up to the urinal
327   and holding the sandwich with one
328   hand
329   he unzipped with the other
330   got it out
331   and urinated.
332   then
333   having finished
334   he shook it and zipped-up with
335   his non-sandwich hand
336   then stood at the urinal and took
337   a big bite out of the sandwich
338   turned
339   and walked out of there without
340   washing his hands.

[Page 48 ]


341   I keep telling people that there are
342   more things to the racetrack than
343   horses.


        XI



344   I don't know where they come from ...
345   the vet's home, probably ...
346   they're old, balding, macho but
347   sexless.
348   the sex drive is no longer important,
349   they are at the track every day
350   arguing over their choices,
351   laughing ...
352   sometimes between races they'll
353   talk about sports: which is
354   the best baseball team, the best
355   hockey team, the best basketball or
356   football team, amateurs and
357   professionals are discussed, and
358   who's the best player at each
359   position ...
360   they often become angry and shout
361   at each other.


362   they wear old clothing, greys and
363   browns, they wear large shoes and
364   they each have a wristwatch ...
365   and while other men their age
366   fight each other
367   in the arena of existence
368   they sit about and argue about
369   whether the screen pass is any longer
370   a valid offensive weapon in professional
371   football. (I don't think that they are
372   really interested, there's simply
373   nothing else to do.)

[Page 49 ]




374   they bet, first standing in front of the
375   window, talking, making last minute
376   adjustments, then one of them bets for
377   all of them.
378   the races end, of course, and each
379   evening they leave ...
380   a wavering line of them ...
381   some stumbling a bit as if
382   they were walking on their
383   shoelaces ...


384   they look worn and done,
385   defeated.


        XII



386   ten minutes before post time
387   the horses, jocks, outriders
388   come out
389   for the post parade.
390   some of the people go to
391   watch.


392   usually about six minutes to
393   post
394   the parade is over
395   and here they come:
396   THE TIDE.

        XIII

I was out there again today. There are some creatures out there,
shirttails hanging out, shoes run down, eyes dulled. Many are
there day after day. How they manage to keep going is the

[Page 51 ]


mystery. They are losers. But somehow they manage to find the
entrance fee, somehow they manage to place feeble bets. But
today I saw the worst. I had also seen him the day before. He
looked lower, more hopeless than any skid row bum, he had a
scabby beard, part of the leather had pulled away from the soles
of his shoes, showing his bare feet. He wore a greasy brown
overcoat but he had a bit of money. I saw him placing bets. He
didn't sit in the stands but on some steps outside where he
played a harmonica very badly. I looked at him. He had on
glasses but one of the lenses had fallen out and the one that
remained was nearly black. As I walked slowly by he started
talking to me. He spoke rapidly, "Hey, ge out ree hoo nar bah!"
The sentences that followed were of a similar order. I couldn't
imagine this man placing a bet or driving an automobile. But he
had a right. Who said he couldn't? And who said he had to /look/ a
certain way? Or talk a certain way? Society dictated modes and
ways. He was outside all that. I remembered starving in New
York City, trying to be a writer. One night I had gone and
bought a bag of popcorn, it was my first food in several days.
The popcorn was hot and greasy and salty, each kernel a
miracle. I walked along in a beautiful trance, feeling the kernels
in my mouth, feeling them enter my body. My trance was not
entire. Two large men walked toward me. They were talking to
each other. One of them looked up just as they passed me and
he said loudly to his buddy, "Jesus Christ, did you see /that/ ?" I was
the freak, the idiot, the one who didn't fit. I walked along, the
kernels not tasting quite so good.

As I passed the man at the racetrack sitting on the steps I
knew that any of us could get lost forever in the crowd, some of
us even wanted to. I walked and found a seat. The horses broke
from the gate. It was 6 furlongs. I had the one horse in a maiden
race. Orange silks. The one hole is usually bad at 6 furlongs but
I had a reason for the bet. My horse broke poorly, rushed, fell
back, I lost sight of him, then as they took the curve for home I
saw orange silks again, he was coming from the outside. He
seemed to hesitate in mid-stretch, then he came on again to win
drawing away. They put up the price. $14.60. I had it ten win.
$73. I got up to cash my ticket. When I did I no longer saw the

[Page 52 ]


man sitting on the steps. I didn't see him the rest of the day. I'll
be looking for him tomorrow. There's a good card going. Three
maiden races. I love those maiden races.

438   driving in for a wash and
439   wax with nothing to do but light a cigarette and
440   stand in the sun ... no rent, no trouble ...
441   hiding from the whores ...


442   ... here it comes, glistening black, you tip the man
443   50 cents, get in, yank up the aerial, adjust side mirror,
444   start it, turn the radio classical, steer it out
445   into the streets ...


446   open sun roof, take the slow lane, hangover lessening,
447   now sleepy in the sun ... you're there ...


448   the parking lot attendants know you: "hey, Champ,
449   how's it going?"


450   inside, you open the Form, decide to have a day
451   with the runners ... already you've spotted two low-
452   price sucker bets in the first race that will not
453   win---that's all you need, an edge ...


454   "Hank ..."


455   it's somebody behind you, you turn, it's your old
456   factory buddy, Spencer Bishop.


457   "hey, Spence ..."


458   "hey, man, I hear you been fooling the people, I
459   hear you been going around to the universities and
460   giving lectures ..."

[Page 53 ]




461   "that's right, my man ..."


462   "what are you going to do when they find you out?"


463   "I'll go back to the factory ..."


464   you go to your seat and watch them come out for the
465   post parade.
466   you could be painting, or in the botanical gardens ...
467   the 6 looks good in the Form /and/ in the flesh ...
468   7/2 is not the world but it's over a third.


469   you get up and move toward the windows.
470   the screenplay is finished, you're into the 4th
471   novel, the poems keep arriving ... not much with
472   the short story but that's waiting, fixing itself
473   up, that whore is getting ready.


474   "ten-win-six," you say to the teller.


475   it's the beginning of a most pleasant afternoon.


476   my next lecture will be
477   /The Positive Influences/
478   /of Gambling/
479   /as a Means of/
480   /Defining Reality as/
481   /Something that/
482   /Can Be Touched Like/
483   /a Book of Matches or/
484   /a Soup Spoon/ .


485   yes, you think, going back to sit down,
486   it's true.

487   some fat son-of-a-bitch with
488   a large pink pig's head
489   on his body
490   came rushing up to me
491   (why?)
492   anyhow
493   I pretended to be looking away
494   and as he closed in
495   I dug my elbow into his gut.
496   I felt it sink in like it was
497   entering a sack of dirty
498   laundry.


499   "mother," he gasped,
500   "help ..."


501   "you all right, buddy?" I
502   asked.


503   he looked as if
504   he was going to puke.
505   his mouth opened.
506   he cupped his hands and
507   a pair of
508   yellow and green false teeth
509   with faded pink insides
510   fell into his palms.


511   I walked on through the crowd
512   and found a betting line.
513   I decided to bet the last 5 races
514   and leave.
515   the only way I would stay
516   would be for $200 an hour
517   tax free.

[Page 55 ]



        XVI



518   I have my figures ready for the
519   6th race
520   then I look up
521   and see, well,
522   there in the stands ahead of
523   me
524   a fellow sits upright.
525   his face is smooth and
526   bland.
527   the physiognomy is set at
528   absolute zero.


529   he has a yellow pencil.
530   he flips it over
531   once
532   into the air and
533   catches it with
534   one hand.


535   he does it
536   again


537   and again


538   with the same
539   timing.


540   what is he
541   doing?


542   he just sits there
543   and continues to
544   repeat the
545   maneuver.


546   I begin to

[Page 56 ]


547   count:


548   one two three
549   four five six ...


550   23, 24, 25, 26,
551   27 ...


552   his movements are
553   dull and graceless,
554   he reminds me of a
555   factory machine.


556   this man is my enemy.


557   45, 46, 47, 48 ...


558   his face has the
559   taut dead skin
560   of a mounted
561   ape


562   and I am sitting
563   with my two-day
564   two-night
565   hangover
566   watching ...


567   53, 54, 55 ...


568   this will be my
569   life in hell: watching
570   men like that
571   sitting forever
572   tossing and
573   catching pencils
574   with one
575   hand

[Page 57 ]


576   in that same
577   non-innovational
578   rhythm ...


579   I am in vertigo.
580   I feel a pressing
581   at the temples
582   as if I was going
583   mad.


584   I can't watch
585   any longer.


586   I get up and walk
587   away from the
588   seating section
589   as I think,


590   it will never
591   let go
592   with the women
593   you live with
594   or wherever you
595   go, supermarkets,
596   bazaars, hang-glider
597   meets, it will
598   find you, maul you,
599   piss over you, let
600   you know
601   about it
602   again.
603   and there will be
604   nobody
605   you can talk to
606   about it.

[Page 58 ]



        XVII



607   I lost a dollar at the track today and I know that's
608   stupid: it's better to win a hundred or lose a hundred---
609   there is at least the jostle of emotions
610   but I was 29 bucks ahead going into the last race so I
611   laid 30 win on this 8-to-one shot going into the last, he
612   came in second, it was back luck
613   that's all. so
614   I lost a dollar.


615   but sometimes we've got to settle for not very much;
616   we need our rest; great tragedy or great victory will
617   arrive soon enough.


618   so I sit here tonight sipping on my wine and listening to
619   a Vaughan Williams symphony on the radio
620   and you too are probably waiting for better or worse.
621   waiting is the greater portion of being around.


622   I waited on that 8-to-one shot in the last race and
623   he came on in the stretch rapidly closing the space
624   between himself and the horse nearing the wire, he came
625   with a beautiful rush, pounding and driving, to fall a
626   head short.


627   such is the life of a gambler: to go away then and wait
628   to return.


629   not all of us are gamblers; those who aren't don't
630   matter.


        XVIII



631   the two old guys behind me were talking.
632   "look at that 7 horse. he's 35-to-one.
633   how can he be 35-to-one?"

[Page 59 ]




634   "yeah, he looks good to me too," says
635   the other old guy.


636   "let's bet him."


637   "o.k., we'll both bet him."


638   they get up to make their bets.


639   I've already bet. I've got 40 win
640   on the 2nd favorite.
641   I win four days out of five at a
642   racetrack. It doesn't seem to be
643   any problem.


644   I open my newspaper, read the financial
645   section, get depressed, turn to the front
646   pages looking for robbery, rape, murder.


647   the two old men are back.
648   "look, the 7 horse is 40-to-one now,"
649   says one of them.


650   "I can't believe it," says the
651   other.


652   the horses are loaded into the gate, the
653   flag goes up, the bell rings, they break
654   out.


655   it's a mile-and-one-sixteenth race, they
656   take the first turn, go down the backstretch,
657   circle the last turn, come down the stretch, get
658   past the finish line.


659   the 2nd favorite wins by a neck, pays
660   $7.80. I make $116.00 on that race.

[Page 60 ]




661   there is silence behind me.
662   then one of the old men says, "the 7 horse
663   didn't run at all."


664   "nope," says the other, "I don't understand
665   it."


666   "maybe the jock didn't try," says
667   his friend.


668   "that must have been it," says
669   the other.


670   like most other men in the world
671   they believe that their failure
672   is caused by any and many factors
673   besides themselves.


674   I watch the two old guys
675   gather over their Racing Form
676   to make their selection in the
677   next race.


678   "gee, look at this!" says one of the
679   old guys, "they got Red Rabbit ten-to-
680   one on the morning line. he looks better
681   than the favorite."


682   "let's bet him," says the other old
683   guy.


684   they leave their seats and move toward the
685   betting windows.

[Page 61 ]



        XIX



686   I am sitting in the stands with a
687   two-night, two-day hangover;
688   the second night was the worst:
689   white wine, red wine and
690   tequila.


691   I am out here because I have
692   evolved an astonishing
693   new theory on
694   how to beat the races.


695   the money is secondary:
696   it only operates as a guideline
697   to see if I am on
698   the given path.


699   I picked up $302
700   the day before
701   and I am $265 ahead
702   going into the sixth.


703   I can barely function
704   but the new theory
705   (Formula K) enacts itself:
706   M plus S plus C plus O
707   (brought down to
708   the relative power of
709   ¼ each):
710   and the horse with the
711   /lowest/ total is
712   the winner.


713   it is like knowing
714   one of the secrets
715   of life itself.
716   when your figures tell you

[Page 62 ]


717   that a 2nd, 3rd or 4th
718   favorite
719   can beat the favorite
720   and when your figures
721   select only /one/ horse,
722   it is a very curious and
723   magic feeling, of course,
724   and you learn to apply
725   the same simplicity to
726   other areas of existence,
727   but to the spiritual
728   rather than the mathematical
729   areas.


        XX



730   20 minutes later
731   I had made my bets
732   and I walked out to the parking lot
733   and to my car.
734   I got in
735   opened the windows and
736   took off my shoes.


737   then I noticed
738   that I was blocked in.
739   some guy had parked behind me
740   in the exit space.


741   I started my engine
742   put it in reverse and
743   jammed my bumper against him.
744   he had his hand brake on
745   but luckily he was in neutral and
746   I slowly ground him back against
747   another car.
748   now the other car wouldn't be able

[Page 63 ]


749   to get out.


750   what made a son-of-a-bitch
751   that way?
752   didn't they have any
753   consideration?


754   I put my shoes on
755   got out
756   and let the air out of his
757   left front tire.


758   no good.
759   he probably had a spare.
760   so I let the air out of his
761   left rear tire
762   got back into my car and
763   maneuvered it out of there
764   with some difficulty.


765   it felt good to
766   drive out of that racetrack.
767   it sure as hell felt better than
768   my first piece of ass and
769   many of the other pieces
770   which followed.

1   most people don't do very well and I get discouraged with
2   their existence, it's such a waste: all those
3   bodies, all those lives
4   malfunctioning: lousy quarterbacks, bad waitresses, in-
5   competent carwash boys and presidents, cowardly
6   goal-keepers
7   inept
8   garage mechanics
9   bumbling tax accountants and
10   so forth.


11   yet


12   now and then


13   I see a single performer doing something with a
14   natural excellence


15   it


16   can be
17   a waitress in some cheap cafe or a 3rd string
18   quarterback
19   coming off the bench with 24 seconds on the clock
20   and completing that winning
21   60 yard pass.


22   which lets me believe that
23   the possibility of the miracle is here with us
24   almost every day


25   and I'm glad that now and then
26   some 3rd string quarterback
27   shows me the truth of that belief
28   whether it be in science, art, philosophy,
29   medicine, politics and/ or etc.

31   this fucking city

6   you notice the red letters

11   stayed home and worked on

16   hit the throttle and
17   begin weaving through and
18   past the other drivers


19   turning the radio up
20   to some sexpot singing
21   about how much she'd
22   like your love

        Bukowski, Charles :  a sad poem [from War All the Time: Poems,
        1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I live in a middle class neighborhood of an unfashionable
2   city
3   but even here there have been murders a half a block
4   away
5   and I would like to write five novels before I leave.
6   my security system man is a weightlifter and he
7   walked about the house
8   checking it out and he noticed the bookcase:
9   "geez, ya got a lot of books!"
10   "I write."
11   "you're a writer?"
12   "yeah ..."
13   "can I have one of your books?"
14   I pulled one down and autographed it for him.


15   he finished the housecheck and recommended various
16   measures.
17   I agreed, wrote him a check for the total amount.


18   the next day he phoned: "listen, I was up all night
19   reading that book. you've been there: all those
20   women, the booze ... you remind me of myself ..."


21   "thanks."


22   "what I like about your writing, it's easy to
23   understand. I'm going to show your book to all
24   the boys down at the office."


25   "o.k."


26   "listen, I saw those weights in your bedroom. do
27   you lift those weights?"


28   "no, they're mostly a decoration."


29   "you ought to work out ..."

[Page 70 ]




30   "I know ..."


31   after he hung up I went in and took a pull at the
32   weights (only 65 pounds), did ten overhead, ten gut
33   pulls, ten arm lifts.


34   that was two months ago, I haven't lifted them
35   since but
36   we haven't been robbed either.
37   just more books stolen from the bookcase (many
38   originals I'll never be able to replace) by
39   friends who come by to drink my wine and talk and
40   laugh with me.
41   no security system will detect that type
42   except my own
43   which has always known and which keeps failing
44   for their sake
45   which is no way to conduct any type of business,
46   even this one.

11   asleep except for
12   two dogs
13   barking
14   at the sound of these
15   keys.


16   it's strange, I think,
17   that the best I know are
18   in trouble
19   while the worst are
20   healthy, calm and
21   prosperous;
22   they are also exception-
23   ally dull
24   and consider themselves
25   my friends.


26   I keep typing these
27   drunk poems
28   sitting in this chair
29   smoking too many
30   cigarettes
31   and not understanding
32   anything
33   and finally
34   not wanting to.

        Bukowski, Charles :  on and off the road [from War All the Time:
        Poems, 1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   flying into a strange town, being met at the
2   airport by a student, then demanding to know
3   where is the nearest bar


4   getting the drinks down while waiting for the
5   luggage
6   then


7   being driven to the hotel, first demanding to
8   be let off at the nearest liquor store


9   later in the hotel room, switching on the tv,
10   getting into bed with the bottle, thinking, I
11   don't have to read until tomorrow night
12   then


13   drinking that night away ...

                    



14   on stage with another bottle, insulting them
15   between poems, they look as if they need the
16   artistry of the insult,
17   anyhow


18   you're going to get your check whether you're
19   good or bad
20   and there's always the chance you might end up
21   in bed with a coed ...

                    



22   flying out of town, back to L.A., your woman
23   meeting you at the airport, driving you in---
24   you're a traveling salesman: you sell
25   poems.


26   back at the place you try to sober up

[Page 74 ]


27   get in an argument with your woman
28   about whether you got laid or not (you
29   never ask /her/ )


30   she claims you got laid. she's sometimes
31   wrong.


32   you will be glad to be at the racetrack
33   the next day
34   just being a horseplayer, standing with the
35   other horseplayers watching them run: that's
36   the good part: not being a poet, not having to
37   get under the sheets with a coed and doing it
38   like you're immortal,
39   meanwhile


40   your woman screaming, "the next reading
41   /I'm/ going with you! /look/ at you! they've sucked
42   you /dry/ !"


43   "gimme another beer, baby ..."


44   she just doesn't understand: it's the only job you
45   have


46   it's the only thing you can do.

        Bukowski, Charles :  too late [from War All the Time: Poems,
        1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I was a slow developer.
2   I got good too late:
3   high school was over,
4   it was summer
5   with no job
6   and my father looking
7   at me over the plates
8   at mealtime.


9   during the day I'd
10   hang around the lots:
11   "hey, anybody want to
12   play football? baseball?"


13   now and then I'd get
14   a few guys and then
15   I'd look good:
16   I could powder the ball
17   better than anybody,
18   I could make impossible
19   graceful catches over my
20   shoulder.


21   at football
22   I was the best broken-
23   field runner in the
24   neighborhood---
25   I laughed at them
26   while
27   dodging past
28   while the young girls
29   and neighborhood people
30   applauded my
31   mastery.


32   but the guys didn't
33   want to play
34   anymore: "listen, Hank,

[Page 76 ]


35   we've got things to
36   do.
37   why didn't you
38   go out for the teams
39   while you were still
40   in school?"


41   then they'd leave
42   and the people would
43   leave and I would be
44   standing in the vacant
45   lot
46   alone.


47   then I'd go
48   back to the house
49   and
50   back to my father
51   watching me over his
52   dinner plate:


53   "well, son, what did you
54   do today? did you find
55   a job?"


56   he should have seen me
57   with all the young girls
58   screaming.


59   he just didn't know
60   who he was
61   sitting at the table
62   with.

        Bukowski, Charles :  on being 20 [from War All the Time: Poems,
        1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   my mother knocked on my roominghouse door
2   and came in
3   looked in the dresser drawer:
4   "Henry you don't have any clean
5   stockings?
6   do you change your underwear?"


7   "Mom, I don't want you poking around in here ..."


8   "I hear that there is a woman
9   who comes to your room late at
10   night and she drinks with you, she lives
11   right down the hall."


12   "she's all right ..."


13   "Henry, you can get a terrible
14   disease."


15   "yeah ..."


16   "I talked with your landlady, she's a
17   nice lady, she says you must read a lot
18   of books in bed because as you fall to sleep at
19   night the books fall to the floor,
20   they can hear it all over the
21   house, heavy books, one at midnight,
22   another at one a.m., another at 2 a.m.,
23   another at four."


24   after she left I took the library books
25   back
26   returned to the roominghouse and
27   put the dirty stockings and the dirty
28   underwear and the dirty shirts into
29   the paper suitcase
30   took the streetcar downtown

[Page 78 ]


31   boarded the Trailways bus to
32   New Orleans
33   figuring to arrive with ten dollars
34   and let them do with me
35   what they would.


36   they did.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the troops [from War All the Time: Poems,
        1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   World War II
2   I was 21
3   riding a bus to
4   New Orleans


5   there were many
6   army men
7   on that
8   bus


9   there were only
10   2
11   young men
12   not in
13   uniform


14   a red-haired
15   fellow and
16   me.


17   the red-haired
18   fellow
19   kept explaining
20   his
21   position to the
22   army
23   boys:


24   "Jesus, you've
25   got to
26   believe me, I
27   want to be with
28   you guys
29   but I can't
30   go, I've got a
31   bad
32   heart!"

[Page 80 ]




33   "that's all
34   right," they
35   told him.


36   I didn't need
37   a
38   confessional,
39   I needed a
40   savior.
41   I pulled out
42   my pint,
43   had a
44   nip, looked
45   out the
46   window ...


47   it was
48   getting into
49   evening
50   when the bus
51   was
52   stopped
53   at the edge
54   of the
55   desert
56   by some more
57   soldiers


58   some soldiers
59   stood outside
60   as 2 entered
61   the bus


62   they heavily
63   trudged
64   along
65   nerve-endings
66   of order and

[Page 81 ]


67   disorder


68   they asked
69   each passenger:


70   "where were
71   you
72   born?"


73   it appeared
74   that 9-tenths of
75   the bus
76   were born in
77   the
78   midwest


79   and when
80   my turn
81   came
82   I said,
83   "Pasadena,
84   California."


85   "where ya
86   going?"


87   "funeral, my
88   brother
89   died."


90   they moved
91   further
92   down in
93   the bus


94   and
95   came upon
96   an old

[Page 82 ]


97   man---


98   "where were
99   you
100   born?"


101   "I don't
102   think," the
103   old man
104   answered,
105   " that's any
106   of your
107   business."


108   "Sir, I
109   asked you,
110   'where were
111   you born?'"


112   "this is a
113   democracy, I
114   don't have
115   to answer
116   that
117   question."


118   /"you son/
119   /of a bitch!"/


120   the soldier
121   grabbed the
122   old man
123   by the
124   back of
125   his
126   coat


127   lifted him
128   from his

[Page 83 ]


129   seat


130   and
131   they dragged
132   the
133   old man
134   down the
135   aisle
136   and out
137   the
138   front door
139   of the
140   bus.


141   the bus
142   stood
143   there
144   and we all
145   looked out
146   the window
147   as a group of
148   soldiers
149   surrounded
150   him


151   we heard:
152   "we're takin'
153   you in!"


154   "but I've
155   got my
156   baggage on
157   the
158   bus!"


159   "fuck
160   your
161   baggage!"

[Page 84 ]




162   then a
163   soldier
164   motioned
165   to the bus
166   driver


167   the
168   bus door
169   closed
170   and the bus
171   drove
172   off.


173   evening
174   quickly became
175   night
176   everybody was
177   silent for a
178   while


179   then the red-
180   haired
181   fellow
182   started it
183   up
184   again:


185   "listen, I
186   really want
187   to go
188   to this
189   war, I'd
190   just give
191   anything if
192   I didn't have
193   this
194   bad
195   heart."

[Page 85 ]




196   the bus
197   just kept on
198   going.

        Bukowski, Charles :  hog [from War All the Time: Poems,
        1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   he couldn't get the puck into the net.
2   he was too slow.
3   all he was was a hog.
4   when somebody
5   on the other team
6   started busting ass and
7   ribcage
8   we'd send him in with instructions to
9   hammer the fucker out.
10   the hog would skate in
11   grinning through his yellow teeth
12   useful at last.
13   he was just like death
14   zeroing in on target:
15   five minutes later
16   there would be a man down:
17   rammed, sticked, sliced
18   out for the game
19   maybe the season
20   and the hog would be sitting in
21   the penalty box, grinning, his
22   job done.


23   nobody liked him.
24   even in the locker room afterwards
25   we didn't talk much to him.
26   he knew.
27   I mean, we spoke to him.
28   sometimes even one of the guys
29   would joke with him about
30   his night's work
31   but nobody laughed very
32   much.


33   afterwards his wife would be
34   waiting outside in an old green
35   station wagon,
36   a ridiculous battered

[Page 87 ]


37   machine
38   and he'd climb in and they'd drive
39   off
40   with her at the wheel, a
41   very tall woman, with a big head,
42   the car going off as always with
43   only the right taillight working.


44   he knew his job.


[Page 88 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  the walls [from War All the Time: Poems,
        1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   after you've hit the bars a while
2   drinking
3   going back to your room with a
4   fat mama
5   doing it
6   sleeping
7   to awaken in the morning
8   to find your wallet gone
9   again


10   no job
11   no food
12   no rent


13   just a hangover and
14   the dark peeling walls.


15   after you've hit the bars a while
16   you carry your wallet in a front
17   pocket
18   you carry a blade
19   you carry most of your bills
20   in your shoe


21   you go to the crapper to make a
22   withdrawal.


23   it gets so /ingrained/ that
24   even when you go to your room
25   alone
26   you automatically hide
27   your wallet and your money
28   and upon awakening
29   you spend hours
30   searching ...


31   it gets so /ingrained/
32   that often when you're drinking with

[Page 89 ]


33   a woman you trust
34   one who is living with you
35   you often awaken to tell
36   her: "shit! I can't find my
37   wallet!"


38   "now you know it's here," she
39   says, "you've just hidden it
40   somewhere."


41   and after some hours
42   you find it.


43   in the old days there were some
44   strange times:
45   once going into a library to
46   return some books
47   you stopped the librarian just as
48   she was taking the books away:
49   "just a moment, please ..."
50   (you saw an edge of green)
51   and you opened the book and
52   pulled out 3 twenties and
53   a ten.


54   another time
55   in a Texas roominghouse
56   after a night of ferocious drinking
57   the next morning
58   you found your wallet
59   but not the money.


60   the rent was due
61   and you told the landlady you had
62   lost your money somewhere ...


63   coming in after a sad walk
64   in the streets

[Page 90 ]


65   the landlady met you


66   she had a handful of green
67   and said,
68   "Mr. Chinaski, I was vacuuming
69   your room and the vacuum kept hitting
70   a bump in the rug and I pulled
71   the rug back
72   and there it was ..."


73   an honest lovely lady.


74   luckily, after that, I met more
75   honest, lovely ladies
76   some who even put money /in/
77   my wallet
78   so I'm not a misogynist
79   being only two or three hundred
80   dollars out,
81   but I have special reservations
82   about those fat mamas of the streets
83   because I think the unkindest
84   crime of all is when
85   the poor rob the poor
86   after talking and drinking and
87   laughing and making love
88   one leaving the other
89   broke and hungover
90   to awaken like that
91   in some strange city
92   alone
93   within dark and
94   peeling walls.

1   she walks in while
2   I'm typing.


3   "listen," she says, "I ..."


4   as I scream and leap out of
5   my chair.


6   "sorry," she says, "I wanted to
7   ask you about something ..."


8   "yes, what is it?"


9   she leaves and I rip the paper
10   from the typer and throw it
11   into the trash.
12   there's no way of
13   getting it back.


14   then I forget about her
15   start again
16   am three or four pages
17   into it when she
18   walks in,


19   "listen, I ..."


20   "HOLY SHIT" I leap out of
21   my chair.


22   I answer her question and
23   she leaves.


24   I sit staring at the page
25   trying to pick up the flow. it's
26   gone.
27   I rip it from the machine,
28   trash it.

[Page 92 ]




29   I sit looking at a
30   cigar box.
31   White Owl, it says.
32   over in a corner
33   I see a dirty bottle.
34   HYDROGEN PEROXIDE,
35   it says.


36   there's nothing like
37   bitching about
38   bad luck: I do it
39   very well.

1   I swept underneath and got him
2   from the rear---
3   a burst of tracers and
4   his gas tank exploded.
5   I saw him trying to
6   climb out of his
7   cockpit
8   but he couldn't
9   eject himself---
10   the ball of trailing flame
11   twisted away
12   to the right
13   down and
14   down
15   to splash into the
16   ocean.


17   I circled over:
18   nothing left.


19   when you get into
20   something like that
21   somebody has
22   to win.


23   I put her back on course
24   to the base.


25   well, he had gotten
26   the one thing done
27   that everybody
28   has to do.


29   I still had
30   it
31   to do.


32   I liked certain

33   delays,

37   beautiful day.

        Bukowski, Charles :  Ginsberg? [from War All the Time: Poems,

1   I am sitting in the clubhouse
2   grandstand
3   $311 ahead going into the
4   7th
5   when this very young man
6   walks up
7   stands there
8   as I am going over the
9   Form.


10   "pardon me," he says.


11   "yes?"


12   "listen," he says, "I think
13   I know you ..."


14   "no," I say, "you don't."


15   "don't you know Allen
16   Ginsberg?"


17   "I don't know any
18   Ginsberg ..."


19   "didn't you give a
20   reading at a
21   nightclub called the
22   Sweetwater?"


23   "I don't know what a
24   reading is ..."


25   "listen," he says, "I
26   /know/ you!"


27   I stand up and face
28   him.

29   "listen, buddy, I'm a
30   gardener for some
31   rich people.
32   that's how I
33   make it."


34   I turn and walk off
35   down through the rows
36   of seats
37   feeling good
38   just like a gardener
39   should
40   out on a gambling night

34   sometimes I think
35   you hate
36   my cat.


37   Martha says
38   you were
39   downstairs
40   sitting with her
41   and you
42   had your
43   pants off.


44   you shouldn't wear
45   those
46   $100 shoes in
47   the garden


48   and you don't keep
49   track
50   of what you
51   plant out there


52   that's
53   /dumb/


54   you must always
55   set the cat's bowl back
56   in
57   the same place.


58   don't
59   bake fish
60   in a frying
61   pan ...


62   I never saw
63   /anybody/
64   harder on the

65   brakes of their
66   car
67   than you.


68   let's go
69   to a
70   movie.


71   listen what's
72   wrong with you?
73   you act
74   depressed.

1   there are worse things than
2   being alone
3   but it often takes decades
4   to realize this

        Bukowski, Charles :  the sword [from War All the Time: Poems,
        1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   watching a tv show
2   late at night
3   there's this
4   Chinese
5   he's very good
6   with the sword
7   he chops off
8   heads
9   or
10   rams it straight
11   on through or
12   slices
13   throats


14   blood spurts
15   heads roll like
16   egg rolls


17   the movie was
18   made in
19   the Orient


20   therefore
21   believable


22   I smoke and
23   drink
24   in the dark


25   thinking


26   my head is
27   still
28   on


29   as
30   this man

[Page 102 ]




31   kills 6 or
32   7 men in 3
33   minutes


34   as I sit
35   and watch


36   not even
37   in sorrow for
38   the murdered


39   for
40   what is
41   important


42   is that a man
43   do his
44   work
45   well


46   of course
47   what is
48   not important
49   is necessary
50   too


51   often
52   they are
53   the same thing:
54   the important and
55   the non-
56   important


57   my head is
58   still
59   on


60   I pour a

[Page 103 ]


61   drink
62   into
63   it


64   and


65   continue
66   to watch
67   the movie:


68   each man
69   alone
70   forever.

        Bukowski, Charles :  practice [from War All the Time: Poems,
        1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   thinking more and more
2   about death
3   Christ, it's getting worse
4   than the horses
5   but
6   something
7   to muse about.


8   I remember Henry Miller on
9   the Tom Snyder Show
10   and Tom asked Henry (who was
11   very very old then):
12   "Mr. Miller, do you ever
13   think of death?"


14   and he answered simply, "of course,
15   I do."


16   I remember reading
17   an excellent poem about death
18   by D.H. Lawrence:
19   "build then
20   the ship of Death
21   for you must take
22   the longest
23   journey
24   to
25   oblivion."


26   the Christians make a similar
27   claim.
28   the other day on the freeway
29   I was following a car and
30   the bumper sticker said:
31   DON'T DIE WITHOUT
32   JESUS.


33   then you get

[Page 105 ]


34   macho guys
35   in factories and
36   in the bars
37   who say:
38   "the only way to die is
39   while
40   you're fucking."


41   well, I've done that too


42   any number
43   of times.

        Bukowski, Charles :  promenade [from War All the Time: Poems,
        1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I am taking a walk about 2:30 p.m.
2   pass a group of kids standing around
3   looking at the engine of a car.
4   the hood is up and one of them appears
5   to be working on the motor.


6   I walk by
7   am thirty or forty feet away from them
8   when one of the kids yells:
9   "hey, old man!"


10   I stop and turn, wait.
11   they don't say anything, look down
12   at the engine.


13   I wait a moment longer, then turn
14   and walk along.


15   I hear one of them laugh, "I don't think
16   he liked that!"


17   I don't mind at all: at the age of 62
18   I can still kick their ass
19   or
20   drink any of them under the
21   table.


22   close to the grave be damned, there's
23   not one of them
24   I'd prefer to be.


25   it's a good afternoon.


26   I hope they fix their
27   engine.

        Bukowski, Charles :  night on a Visa card [from War All the
        Time: Poems, 1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I finished my wine
2   poured another
3   took a hit of that
4   lit a cigarette.


5   the motel room was
6   paid for until eleven
7   a.m.
8   nice tiny little white
9   towels
10   in the bathroom and
11   the paper-wrapped
12   soap bars
13   the celluloid glasses
14   and the
15   paper-wrapping over
16   the toilet seat.


17   I switched on the
18   tv
19   an old black and
20   white


21   I left the sound
22   off and
23   watched the
24   faces.
25   one man and
26   one woman.
27   there seemed to
28   be trouble.
29   they looked
30   unhappy although
31   to most people
32   their faces would
33   seem beautiful.


34   I kept watching

[Page 108 ]


35   them while I smoked
36   and drank more
37   wine.


38   then I shut the
39   tv off
40   got out of my
41   shorts
42   walked over to
43   the bed
44   pulled the cover
45   and sheet
46   back
47   crawled in.


48   outside on Sunset Boulevard
49   I could see all the
50   neon through the
51   blinds.


52   I got up
53   cut the blinds
54   got back in.
55   it was good and
56   dark.
57   perfect.


58   there was a tap
59   on the door.
60   I opened it with
61   the chain
62   on and
63   looked out.


64   she was back.
65   I let her
66   in.

[Page 109 ]




67   "it was awful,"
68   she said
69   getting un-
70   dressed.
71   "some son of a
72   bitch tried to
73   rape me and take
74   my purse in the
75   parking lot!
76   I kicked him in
77   the balls!
78   compared to /him/
79   /you/ look
80   good!"


81   "thank you,
82   Sherrie, I feel
83   blessed . . ."


84   she climbed into
85   bed next to
86   me.


87   "I just want to
88   get off the fucking
89   streets!"


90   "yeah. I know what
91   you mean."


92   "anything on tv?"
93   she asked
94   splashing wine into
95   her glass.


96   "just one station,"
97   I said

[Page 110 ]




98   getting up and
99   turning the set on
100   again
101   with sound
102   and returned to the
103   bed.


104   the woman on tv
105   said to the man
106   on tv, "you've got
107   to choose between your
108   wife and me! I'm
109   /tired/ of hiding what
110   we are doing!
111   I want our love to be out
112   /front/
113   like a marching band
114   like a flag of
115   glory!"


116   the man bowed his
117   head and
118   didn't answer.


119   the one
120   next to me
121   in bed:
122   I refilled her
123   glass.


124   by eleven a.m. we'd
125   both be gone
126   somewhere
127   else
128   and the motel maid
129   would come in and
130   clean up
131   after us.

[Page 111 ]




132   she'd go back to
133   the streets and I'd
134   go back to
135   sometimes
136   writing about
137   them.


138   but meanwhile
139   we sat up on our
140   butts
141   pillows to our
142   backs
143   the ashtray
144   between us on
145   the bed


146   we drank our wine
147   from plastic glasses.
148   it was a
149   terrible movie
150   but it was
151   nice
152   sitting there in
153   the dark
154   watching it
155   while
156   smoking and
157   drinking
158   without having
159   to say
160   anything.

1   she confessed to me
2   what made her
3   do it:


4   "when I first walked
5   into your place
6   I looked around
7   and it was filthy
8   but you were the first
9   man I'd ever met
10   who didn't have a
11   tv set,
12   and it was right
13   then
14   that I decided to
15   fuck you."


16   of course, what I
17   didn't like about
18   that was
19   somebody else
20   deciding
21   anything


22   so I went out
23   and bought a second
24   hand
25   black and white for
26   $75


27   but she still climbed
28   into bed
29   with me


30   so I went out
31   and purchased a large
32   screen

[Page 113 ]


33   color tv with
34   touch control
35   and she still climbed
36   into bed
37   with me


38   but we played only the
39   radio
40   ate sandwiches in the
41   park
42   met all her sisters
43   and waited for it
44   to end.

        Bukowski, Charles :  good time girl [from War All the Time:

1   you had /your/ crowd
2   out back ... your people just
3   sitting there and drinking and
4   listening to you ...


5   you were /competing/ with
6   me!
7   but /we/ danced!
8   /we/ had a /good/ time!
9   and god, we /laughed/ too!
10   you missed /Culpepper!/
11   god, Culpepper was /funny!/
12   we danced and laughed, that's what
13   a party's /for!/


14   you don't know it, but I went back
15   there
16   and I saw you with 3 or 4
17   people,
18   god, how /somber/ you all were!
19   it was like a meeting of the
20   /dead!/


21   well, you /tried/ to compete with me
22   and you /failed!/
23   I'm from the country and we know
24   how to party!
25   you think I dance too sexy!
26   /sure/ I shake my ass!
27   it feels /good!/
28   WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO, COVER
29   ALL THIS WITH A GRANNY DRESS?


30   I dance close and I follow the man's
31   lead, I was always taught to follow
32   the man's lead since I was a
33   little girl!
34   in the country, that's natural,

[Page 115 ]


35   there's nothing /dirty/ about it!
36   /you're/ the one with the dirty
37   mind!
38   you're /jealous/ because you can't
39   dance.
40   and you don't /like/ people because
41   you're /afraid/ of them!
42   I /like/ people and I /like/ parties
43   and I like to /dance!/
44   and so do all my sisters, they'd
45   drive 2,000 miles to go to a
46   party!


47   well, why don't you /say/ something?
48   you just sit there drinking and
49   looking at me!


50   hey, where the hell are you
51   /going?/


52   you're always running out the
53   door and jumping into your car
54   and driving off!


55   well, if you don't want my
56   pussy
57   somebody else
58   will!

        Bukowski, Charles :  the lady poet [from War All the Time:
        Poems, 1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   it was 7 or 8 years ago
2   we lived together
3   with our 2 typewriters
4   working away
5   and her 2 children
6   manipulating the room.


7   she was difficult with
8   her brats:
9   "get /away/ ! can't you see
10   that Mama is
11   /typing/ ?"


12   so they would come to me
13   and I would
14   answer their questions be-
15   tween my beers and
16   my lines.


17   I really wasn't /too/ fond
18   of them
19   but I wanted the lady to
20   do well:
21   poetry was important to
22   her,
23   she became very excited
24   and hammered the keys
25   as if great verse
26   was being drilled
27   into the page.


28   when she finished a poem
29   she'd bring it to me
30   and I'd read it,
31   "yes, it's good ... but
32   don't you think it'd
33   read better if you
34   began at line

[Page 117 ]


35   4, dropped line
36   7 ... and then, of
37   course, you are going
38   to need an ending
39   line, I don't like the
40   ending ..."


41   "what do you think
42   the ending should
43   be?"


44   "how about ..." and
45   I would suggest a
46   line.


47   "why, yes, of course!"
48   she'd say, then run over
49   and reshape the
50   poem.

                    



51   the lady's poems began to
52   appear in some of the
53   little magazines
54   and soon
55   she was invited to give
56   readings at the
57   local poetry holes
58   and I went with her
59   and
60   listened


61   she had long hair and
62   wild, wild eyes, and
63   she danced and pranced up
64   there with her poems,
65   overdramatizing,

[Page 118 ]


66   but she had a great
67   body
68   and she
69   twisted
70   it
71   and read and waved her
72   poems


73   and the men loved her,
74   such men as there are in
75   such places
76   with their little rhymers
77   tucked into their
78   knapsacks
79   and their neutered faces
80   glistening---
81   the applause made the lady
82   think
83   that things were really
84   occurring
85   and it kept her
86   twisting
87   prancing, dancing
88   and
89   typing ...


90   the lady
91   one night
92   after lovemaking
93   told me,
94   "some day I will be
95   greater than
96   you!"


97   "at many things,"
98   I replied, "you
99   already are."

[Page 119 ]




100   we typed together
101   and apart
102   for some years
103   and as such things finally go
104   it went.


105   she dissolved to some
106   desert town
107   and I repaired to
108   East Hollywood
109   where I lived with some
110   ladies
111   who didn't give a fuck
112   about typing at
113   all, who really didn't
114   give a fuck about
115   anything.


116   I lived through that time,
117   got away,
118   moved to a small town
119   near the harbor
120   where I began to hear from
121   the lady poet
122   again
123   via phone and letter.
124   mainly, I was evasive, having
125   learned some time ago that
126   going back
127   doesn't mesh with going
128   forward.


129   "you were my /muse/ ,"
130   she said, again and
131   again, "I can't write
132   anymore ..."


133   so, you see, I served a

[Page 120 ]


134   purpose:
135   and that's
136   a rather nice thing, don't you
137   think?


138   much better, I think, than
139   being known for being kindly
140   under stress
141   or having a big throbbing
142   dick
143   waving
144   forevermore ready
145   to enter those hungry
146   thighs
147   where no man, beast or
148   god
149   can stay forever
150   or even
151   wants to?

        Bukowski, Charles :  space creatures [from War All the Time:
        Poems, 1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   they are at the track every
2   Saturday afternoon: two
3   immensely fat men
4   a fat woman
5   and the fat woman's son
6   (who is also getting obese
7   and is the son of one of
8   the men).


9   they sit together
10   eat hotdogs
11   drink beer
12   and scream together
13   during the race
14   and after the
15   race.
16   no matter
17   who wins
18   they scream.
19   between races they
20   argue while consuming
21   hotdogs and beer.


22   I sit and watch them
23   from a distance.
24   they are far more
25   interesting than
26   the horses or
27   the war in
28   Nicaragua.


29   as I watch
30   the fattest man
31   lifts his beercup
32   (large size)
33   and gulps down a
34   mass of suds.
35   his mouth is

[Page 122 ]


36   strangely small and
37   he bites at
38   the cup and
39   much of the beer
40   spills out
41   runs down
42   each side
43   of his chin and
44   onto
45   his shirt.
46   he pulls the cup
47   out of his mouth
48   and screams:
49   "SHIT!"


50   "YOU ASSHOLE!"
51   the fat woman
52   screams at
53   him.


54   "SHUT UP!"
55   he screams
56   back at her.


57   then they both
58   sit there
59   not angry
60   at all
61   as if nothing
62   had occurred.


63   then
64   the other
65   fat man
66   says:
67   "I'M GONNA BET
68   THE 6, THE 3 AND
69   THE 9!"

[Page 123 ]




70   even though
71   he's only speaking
72   it's as if
73   the average person were
74   shouting.


75   the son
76   is dressed in
77   red pants
78   white t-shirt
79   white tennis
80   shoes.


81   the two men
82   are dressed
83   in black pants
84   white t-shirts
85   and very shiny
86   black shoes.


87   they look like
88   brothers.


89   the woman is
90   dressed in a
91   soiled white
92   dress
93   wears faded
94   green
95   tennis shoes
96   without socks.


97   as I watch she
98   lifts
99   her beercup
100   (large size).
101   she also has
102   a tiny

[Page 124 ]


103   mouth
104   but she has
105   pinched the edge
106   of the cup,
107   made a little
108   runway.


109   she drains the
110   cup
111   crushes it
112   flips it off to
113   one side
114   belches:
115   "WHO'S GONNA BUY
116   THE NEXT FUCKING
117   ROUND?"


118   nobody sits
119   near them.


120   these,
121   I think, could be
122   space creatures
123   from a distant
124   planet.


125   I rather
126   like them.
127   their attention span
128   is limited
129   but they make
130   few pretenses.


131   "I'M GOING TO GARDENA
132   TONIGHT!" says the man
133   who isn't /quite/ as fat
134   as the other.

[Page 125 ]




135   "YOU CAN'T BEAT THOSE
136   GRAND-
137   MOTHERS!" says the
138   fattest.
139   "THEY SIT ON THEIR
140   HANDS."


141   "SHUT UP!"
142   says
143   the woman.


144   the son
145   in the red pants
146   never says
147   anything.
148   he just sits
149   around and
150   stands around
151   gradually getting
152   bigger.


153   then the horses
154   appear on the track
155   for the
156   post parade.


157   "SHOEMAKER THE
158   FAKER!" the fattest
159   man screams at
160   the world's
161   winningest
162   jock.


163   Shoemaker blinks but
164   carries on.
165   having made a
166   few million

[Page 126 ]


167   he understands the
168   rancor of
169   losers.


170   then the woman
171   leaps up.
172   well, she doesn't
173   leap ... she
174   rises, a
175   mountain of
176   womanhood and
177   says: "HEY, DIDJA
178   SEE THAT? THE 5
179   HORSE JUST SHIT!
180   HE'S GONNA BE
181   LIGHTER! THAT GIVES
182   HIM THE ADVANTAGE!
183   25 TO ONE! I GOT
184   MY GOD DAMNED
185   BET!"


186   "SIT DOWN!" says the
187   fattest one. "YOU'RE
188   BLOCKING OUT THE
189   SUN!"


190   I leave then.
191   go to the betting
192   window.
193   I bet Shoemaker the
194   faker.


195   when I come back
196   they're gone.
197   I don't understand
198   it.


199   the race goes

[Page 127 ]


200   off.
201   Shoemaker comes
202   in at
203   5 to one.
204   I've got him
205   20 win.


206   they don't
207   return
208   after that
209   race or the
210   next.


211   and I realize
212   that
213   they are
214   gone


215   I am beset with
216   an inescapable
217   sadness


218   they have gone
219   somewhere


220   they are somewhere
221   else


222   they are drinking
223   beer and eating


224   getting bigger
225   and louder


226   these
227   terrible
228   obnoxious
229   undefeated

[Page 128 ]


230   beings.


231   I miss them.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the history of a tough motherfucker [from
        War All the Time: Poems, 1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   he came to the door one night wet thin beaten and
2   terrorized
3   a white cross-eyed tailless cat
4   I took him in and fed him and he stayed
5   grew to trust me until a friend drove up the driveway
6   and ran him over
7   I took what was left to a vet who said, "not much
8   chance ... give him these pills ... his backbone
9   is crushed, but it was crushed before and somehow
10   mended, if he lives he'll never walk, look at
11   these x-rays, he's been shot, look here, the pellets
12   are still there ... also, he once had a tail, somebody
13   cut it off ..."


14   I took the cat back, it was a hot summer, one of the
15   hottest in decades, I put him on the bathroom
16   floor, gave him water and pills, he wouldn't eat, he
17   wouldn't touch the water, I dipped my finger into it
18   and wet his mouth and I talked to him, I didn't go any-
19   where, I put in a lot of bathroom time and talked to
20   him and gently touched him and he looked back at
21   me with those pale blue crossed eyes and as the days went
22   by he made his first move
23   dragging himself forward by his front legs
24   (the rear ones wouldn't work)
25   he made it to the litter box
26   crawled over and in,
27   it was like the trumpet of possible victory
28   blowing in that bathroom and into the city, I
29   related to that cat---I'd had it bad, not that
30   bad but bad enough ...


31   one morning he got up, stood up, fell back down and
32   just looked at me.


33   "you can make it," I said to him.


34   he kept trying, getting up and falling down, finally

[Page 131 ]


35   he walked a few steps, he was like a drunk, the
36   rear legs just didn't want to do it and he fell again, rested,
37   then got up.


38   you know the rest: now he's better than ever, cross-eyed,
39   almost toothless, but the grace is back, and that look in
40   his eyes never left ...


41   and now sometimes I'm interviewed, they want to hear about
42   life and literature and I get drunk and hold up my cross-eyed,
43   shot, runover de-tailed cat and I say, "look, look
44   at /this/ !"


45   but they don't understand, they say something like, "you
46   say you've been influenced by Celine?"


47   "no," I hold the cat up, "by what happens, by
48   things like this, by this, by /this/ !"


49   I shake the cat, hold him up in
50   the smoky and drunken light, he's relaxed he knows ...


51   it's then that the interviews end
52   although I am proud sometimes when I see the pictures
53   later and there I am and there is the cat and we are photo-
54   graphed together.


55   he too knows it's bullshit but that somehow it all helps.

        Bukowski, Charles :  our curious position [from War All the
        Time: Poems, 1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   Saroyan on his deathbed said,
2   "I thought I would never die ..."


3   I know what he meant:
4   I think of myself forever
5   rolling a cart through a
6   supermarket
7   looking for onions, potatoes
8   and bread
9   while watching the misshapen
10   and droll ladies push
11   by.
12   I think of myself forever
13   driving the freeway
14   looking through a dirty
15   windshield with the radio tuned to
16   something I don't want
17   to hear.
18   I think of myself forever
19   tilted back in a
20   dentist's chair
21   mouth
22   crocodiled open
23   musing that
24   I'm in
25   /Who's Who in America/ .
26   I think of myself forever
27   in a room with a depressed
28   and unhappy woman.
29   I think of myself forever
30   in the bathtub
31   farting underwater
32   watching the bubbles
33   and feeling proud.


34   but dead, no ...
35   blood pin-pointed out of
36   the nostrils,

[Page 133 ]


37   my head cracking across
38   the desk
39   my fingers grabbing at
40   dark space ...
41   impossible ...


42   I think of myself forever
43   sitting upon the edge
44   of the bed
45   in my shorts with
46   toenail clippers
47   cracking off
48   huge ugly chunks
49   of nail
50   as I smile
51   while my white cat
52   sits in the window
53   looking out over the
54   town
55   as the telephone
56   rings ...


57   in between the
58   punctuating
59   agonies
60   life is such a
61   gentle habit:
62   I understand what
63   Saroyan
64   meant:


65   I think of myself forever
66   walking down the
67   stairs
68   opening the door
69   walking to the
70   mailbox
71   and finding all that

[Page 134 ]


72   advertising
73   which
74   I don't believe
75   either.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the sickness [from War All the Time: Poems,
        1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   if
2   one night
3   I write
4   what I consider to
5   be
6   5 or 6 good poems
7   then I begin
8   to worry:


9   suppose the house
10   burns down?


11   I'm not worried
12   about
13   the house
14   I'm worried
15   about
16   those 5 or 6
17   poems
18   burning
19   up


20   or


21   an x-girlfriend
22   getting in
23   here
24   while I'm away
25   and stealing or
26   destroying
27   the poems.


28   after writing
29   5 or 6 poems
30   I am fairly
31   drunk
32   and
33   I sit

[Page 136 ]


34   having a few
35   more
36   drinks
37   while deciding
38   where to hide
39   the poems.


40   sometimes I
41   hide the poems
42   while
43   thinking about
44   hiding
45   them
46   and when I
47   decide to
48   hide them
49   I can't find
50   them ...


51   then
52   begins the
53   search


54   and the
55   whole room is
56   a mass of
57   papers
58   anyhow


59   and


60   I'm very clever
61   at
62   hiding poems
63   perhaps more
64   clever than I
65   am
66   at

[Page 137 ]


67   writing
68   them.


69   so
70   then
71   I find them
72   have another
73   drink


74   hide them
75   again


76   forget it
77   then
78   go
79   to sleep ...


80   to awaken in
81   late morning
82   to remember
83   the poems
84   and
85   begin the
86   search
87   again ...


88   usually only a
89   ten or fifteen
90   minute
91   period of
92   agony


93   to find
94   them
95   and read
96   them
97   and then
98   not like them

[Page 138 ]


99   very much


100   but you know
101   after all
102   that
103   work


104   all that
105   drinking
106   hiding
107   searching
108   finding


109   I decide
110   it's only
111   fair
112   to send
113   them
114   out
115   as a
116   record of
117   my travail


118   which
119   if accepted
120   will appear in
121   a little
122   magazine
123   circulation
124   between
125   100 and
126   750


127   a year-and
128   one-half
129   later


130   maybe.

[Page 139 ]


131   it's
132   worth
133   it.

        Bukowski, Charles :  an old buddy [from War All the Time: Poems,

1   he writes to the editors
2   telling them that
3   I'm finished
4   and encloses masses
5   of his manuscript
6   which
7   when returned
8   goads him into
9   vitriolic
10   response.


11   it's possible,
12   of course,
13   that I'm
14   finished;
15   one gets
16   finished
17   one way or
18   the
19   other.


20   I think he's
21   a pretty good

        Bukowski, Charles :  John Dillinger marches on [from War All the
        Time: Poems, 1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I sometimes write about the 30's because
2   they were a good training ground.
3   people learned to live with adversity
4   as a common everyday thing
5   when trouble came
6   they adjusted and made the next move,
7   and if there wasn't one
8   they often created
9   one.


10   and the people who /had/ jobs
11   did them with artistry.
12   a garage mechanic could /fix/ your
13   car.
14   doctors made house calls.
15   cab drivers not only knew every
16   street in town
17   but they were also versed in
18   philosophy.
19   pharmacists would walk up to you
20   in drugstores and ask you what you
21   needed.
22   the ushers in movie houses were more
23   handsome than the movie
24   stars.
25   people made their own clothes,
26   repaired their own shoes.
27   almost everybody did things well.


28   now people in and out of their
29   professions are totally
30   inept,
31   how they even wipe their own asses
32   is beyond me.
33   and when adversity arrives they are
34   dismayed,
35   they quit,
36   spit it out,

[Page 144 ]


37   lay down.
38   these, coddled to the extremes
39   are only used to victory or
40   the soft way.


41   it's not their fault, I suppose,
42   that they didn't live
43   through the 30's
44   but I'm still hardly tempted to
45   adore
46   them.

        Bukowski, Charles :  terminology [from War All the Time: Poems,
        1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   my other favorite cat seemed to be dying and
2   I had him in and out of the vet's
3   for x-rays, consultations, injections,
4   operations


5   "anything at all," I told the doc,
6   "let's try to keep him going ..."


7   one morning I drove over to pick him
8   up and the girl at the counter
9   a vast girl in a wrap-around white
10   nurse's outfit
11   asked me, "do you want your cat put
12   to sleep?"


13   "what?" I asked.


14   she repeated her
15   statement.


16   "put to sleep?" I asked, "you mean
17   /exterminated/ ?"


18   "well, yes," she said, smiling with her
19   tiny eyes, then looking at the card
20   in her hand she said, "oh, I see it was
21   /Mrs. Evans/ who wanted it done ..."


22   "really?" I asked.


23   "sorry," she said and walked into the other
24   room with her card and her sorry fat ass and
25   her sorry walk and her sorry life and
26   her sorry death and her sorry Mrs. Evans and
27   both of their sorry fat shits.


28   I walked over, sat down and opened up a
29   cat magazine, then closed it, thinking, it's

[Page 146 ]


30   just her job, it's something she does, /she/ doesn't
31   kill the cats.


32   when she came into the office again she no
33   longer quite disgusted me and I opened the pages
34   of the cat magazine again and looked at and turned
35   the pages as if I had forgotten everything, which
36   I hadn't
37   exactly.

1   I was drunk and they
2   got me out of my car
3   put the bracelets on
4   and made me lay down
5   on the roadway
6   in the rain.


7   they stood in their
8   yellow raincoats
9   cops from 3
10   squadcars.


11   the water soaked
12   into my clothing.
13   I looked up
14   at the moon through
15   the raindrops,
16   thinking,
17   here I am
18   62 years old
19   and being
20   protected
21   from myself
22   again.


23   earlier that night
24   I had attended the
25   opening
26   of a movie
27   which portrayed the
28   life of a drunken
29   poet:
30   me.


31   this then was

33   of their
34   effort.

1   the other day
2   I'm out at the track
3   betting Early Bird
4   (that's when you bet at the
5   track before it opens)
6   I am sitting there having
7   a coffee and going over
8   the Form
9   and this guy slides toward
10   me---
11   his body is twisted
12   his head shakes
13   his eyes are out of
14   focus
15   there is spittle upon his
16   lips


17   he manages to get close to
18   me and asks,
19   "pardon me, sir, but could you
20   tell me the number of
21   Lady of Dawn in the
22   first race?"


23   "it's the 7 horse,"
24   I tell him.


25   "thank you, sir,"

1   all up and down the avenues
2   the people are in pain;
3   they sleep in pain, they awaken
4   in pain;
5   even the buildings are in pain,
6   the bridges
7   the flowers are in pain
8   and there is no release---
9   pain sits
10   pain floats
11   pain waits
12   pain is.


13   don't ask why there are
14   drunks
15   drug addicts
16   suicides


17   the music is bad
18   and the love
19   and the script:

        Bukowski, Charles :  a note to the boys in the back room: [from
        War All the Time: Poems, 1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I get more and more mimeo chapbooks in the mail
2   written by fellows who used to know me
3   in the good old days.


4   these fellows are all writers
5   and they write about me
6   and they seem to remember
7   what I said
8   what I did.


9   some of it is exaggerated
10   some of it is humorous
11   and a majority of it is
12   self-serving---


13   where I tend to look bad or
14   ridiculous
15   or even insane
16   they always describe themselves
17   as calm and dependable observers
18   instead of
19   (in many cases)
20   as the non-talented
21   boring
22   ass-sucking
23   pretentious and
24   time-consuming
25   little farts
26   that they were.


27   I feel no rancor at what they
28   write.
29   it's only that I've already done a
30   better job
31   with that particular subject
32   matter


33   and I would suggest that they

[Page 153 ]


34   move on to the next man
35   just as my women have
36   done.

        Bukowski, Charles :  sardines in striped dresses [from War All
        the Time: Poems, 1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   all right, they're playing Beethoven again; when I was
2   sleeping on that park bench in Texas they were playing
3   Beethoven, when it rained last Sunday and the pier fell
4   into the water they were playing Beethoven; I walked on
5   that pier 55 years ago and now it's down in the ocean,
6   like Atlantis
7   but things break and vanish, that's not news, got a
8   letter today from Louise, she says she's leaving the
9   French Quarter and moving in with her sister in a small
10   town 45 minutes out of New Orleans.
11   people are getting tired, people are falling down and getting
12   back up, and they are playing Beethoven as the bums stop
13   me outside the post office: "Good morning, sir, have you
14   got a dollar?"


15   the old aerial circus is falling from the sky, dogs and
16   cats look at me oddly, the Klan appears, vanishes, Hitler
17   sniffles underground between palm tree roots, this cheap
18   cigar I'm smoking, it says Cuba, it says Havana, smuggled
19   all this way to gag me as
20   they are playing Beethoven, as Beethoven plays
21   William Saroyan is dead Celine is dead but Fante won't
22   die
23   legs chopped off, and blind in his narrow grave he won't
24   die:
25   3 years laying flat like that in that hospital, what is
26   he thinking?


27   I want to go quick like a seedless olive into the mouth
28   of a fool, as young girls keep arriving from Des
29   Moines wiggling like sardines in striped dresses, what
30   does it mean, listening to Beethoven now?


31   and now it's over ... "Head for some Palm Springs sun,"
32   the announcer begins as I tune him out and grimace at
33   this cigar, turn the radio back up: it's
34   Mahler, the 10th, right after the Bee's 5th, some hell
35   of a heavy night as pretty much alone here

[Page 155 ]


36   I think of how much I like Somerset Maugham's title /The Razor's
Edge/ ,
37   then I put out the fucking cigar, drain some wine,
38   get up, thinking, it's the
39   same for everybody, more or less, some more, some
40   less, Celine's dead, Beethoven's quiet a moment:
41   it's been a world full of the brave
42   and I love them all
43   as outside the
44   Vincent Thomas Bridge arcs in the dark
45   holding, just now, the luck of us all.

        Bukowski, Charles :  result [from War All the Time: Poems,
        1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the room was small but neat and when I visited him
2   he was on that bed like a grounded seal
3   and it was embarrassing, I mean,
4   coming across with the conversation;
5   I really didn't know him that well
6   except through his writing,
7   and they kept him drugged---
8   they kept operating, chopping parts of him
9   away
10   but being a true writer
11   Fante talked about his next novel.


12   blind, and cut away, again and again,
13   he had already dictated one novel
14   from that bed
15   a good work, it had been published
16   and now he talked to me about another
17   but I knew he wouldn't make it
18   and the nurses knew
19   everybody knew
20   but he just went on talking to me
21   about his next novel.
22   he had an unusual plot idea
23   and I told him it sounded
24   great,
25   and after another visit or two
26   his wife phoned me one afternoon
27   and told me that
28   it was over ...


29   it's all right, John, nobody has ever
30   written that last one.


31   you were really tough on those nurses, though,
32   and that pleased me, the way you brought them
33   running in there in their crinkled whites,
34   you proved me more than right:
35   my assertion

[Page 157 ]


36   that your power of command
37   with simple language was
38   one of the magnificent things of
39   our century.

        Bukowski, Charles :  suggestion for an arrangement [from War All
        the Time: Poems, 1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   it would be nice to die at the typer instead of with my
2   ass stuck into some hard bed pan.


3   I visited a writer friend in the hospital who was dying
4   inch by inch
5   in the most terrible way
6   possible.
7   yet during each visit
8   (when conscious) he continued to
9   talk to me
10   about his
11   writing (not as an accomplishment but
12   as a magic obsession)
13   and he didn't mind my
14   visits because
15   he knew I understood exactly what he was
16   saying.


17   at his funeral
18   I expected him to rise from his
19   coffin and say, "Chinaski,
20   it was a good run, well
21   worth it."


22   he never knew what I looked like
23   because before I met him
24   he had become blind
25   but he knew I
26   understood
27   his slow and terrible
28   death.


29   I told him one time that
30   the gods were punishing him because
31   he wrote so
32   well.


33   I hope that I never write that

[Page 159 ]


34   well, I want to die with my head down on this
35   machine
36   3 lines from the bottom of the
37   page
38   burnt-out cigarette in my
39   fingers, radio still
40   playing


41   I just want to write
42   just well enough to
43   end like
44   that.

1   you know
2   it was very good
3   it was
4   better than
5   anything


6   it was like
7   something
8   we could
9   pick up

13   about.


14   we were on the

19   we were in the garden
20   we were in the
21   endless pit


22   never such a place
23   as that


24   it was deep
25   and
26   it was light
27   and
28   it was high


29   it got so near
30   to insanity

        Bukowski, Charles :  transformation and disfiguration [from War
        All the Time: Poems, 1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   there were always little tragedies
2   we heard about them on the job
3   sitting on those stools
4   eleven-and-one-half hours a night
5   every bit of outside news
6   was greeted by us
7   much like the inmates of a prison camp


8   every now and then
9   a courier would come by and say
10   "it's 3 to 2, end of the 3rd ..."


11   he never said 3 to 2 /who/
12   because
13   we were able to decipher all that


14   one night I heard two fellows
15   talking:
16   "Ralph checked out early
17   when he walked into his house
18   it was dark
19   his wife and her lover were in bed
20   they thought he was a burglar
21   the lover had a gun
22   and he shot Ralph ..."


23   "where's Louie?"
24   I asked one night
25   I hadn't seen Louie
26   in a couple of weeks
27   Louie had two jobs
28   when he slept I didn't know


29   "Louie?
30   Louie fell asleep in bed
31   smoking a cigarette
32   the mattress caught fire
33   he burned to death ..."

[Page 163 ]




34   there were many deaths
35   among the mail clerks


36   feeling like an
37   inmate of a prison
38   I also felt as if we were
39   front line troops
40   under continual bombardment and
41   attack


42   when there weren't deaths
43   there were breakdowns---
44   people who after years of
45   sticking letters
46   just couldn't do it anymore


47   or there were dismissals
48   for the slightest reason


49   it was death and transformation
50   and disfiguration:
51   people found
52   they couldn't walk anymore
53   or they suddenly
54   came up with speech defects
55   or they were shaken by tremors or
56   their eyes blinked or
57   they came to work drugged or
58   drunk or both


59   it was terror and dismemberment
60   and the survivors
61   hunched on their stools wondering
62   who would be next


63   the supervisors brutalized us
64   and the supervisors
65   were in turn brutalized

[Page 164 ]


66   by their superiors who
67   were in turn brutalized
68   by the Postmaster General
69   who always demanded
70   more for less
71   and the public brutalized
72   the Postmaster General
73   and it was finally
74   the little old lady
75   pruning her garden roses
76   who was the first cause
77   of misery for everybody:
78   Democracy at work


79   one night I asked,
80   "where's Hodges?"


81   (I don't know why but
82   I was always
83   the last to know anything
84   perhaps because I was white
85   and most of them were black)


86   there was no reply
87   about Hodges
88   who was the meanest soup
89   and /white/
90   to top it all


91   and I asked again
92   and somebody said
93   "he won't be around
94   for a while ..."


95   and then
96   in pieces and bits
97   it was revealed to me:
98   Hodges had been knifed

[Page 165 ]


99   in the parking lot
100   on the way to his car


101   and then
102   it was inferred
103   that everybody knew
104   who did it


105   "would it be anybody
106   I know?"
107   I smiled


108   it got very quiet
109   Big George put his mail down
110   stared at me
111   he stared at me a long time
112   then he turned
113   started sticking his letters again


114   and I said
115   "I wonder who's winning
116   the old ball game?"


117   "4 to 2,"
118   somebody said
119   "end of the 4th ..."


120   Hodges never came back
121   and soon
122   I got out of there too.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the famous writer [from War All the Time:
        Poems, 1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   when I was a mailman
2   one of my routes was special:
3   a famous writer lived in one of those
4   houses,
5   I recognized his name on the letters,
6   he was a famous writer but not a very
7   good one,
8   and I never saw him
9   until this one morning when I was
10   hungover
11   I walked up to his house
12   and he was outside
13   he was standing in an old bathrobe,
14   he needed a shave and he looked ill
15   about 3 years from death
16   but he had this good looking woman
17   standing there with him
18   she was much younger than he
19   the sun shining through her full hair
20   and her thin dress,
21   I handed him his mail over the gate and
22   said, "I've read your books,"
23   but he didn't answer
24   he just looked down at the letters
25   and I said, "I'm a writer too ..."
26   he still didn't answer,
27   he turned and walked off
28   and she looked at me
29   with a face that said nothing,
30   then turned and followed
31   him.


32   I moved on to the next house
33   where halfway across the lawn
34   a toy bulldog
35   came charging out
36   growling
37   with his putrid little eyes

[Page 167 ]


38   seething
39   I caught him under the belly with
40   my left foot
41   and flung him up against a
42   picture window
43   and then I felt much better
44   but not
45   entirely
46   so.

        Bukowski, Charles :  darlings [from War All the Time: Poems,

1   a world full of successful people's
2   sons
3   on bicycles
4   on the Hollywood Riviera
5   at 3:11 p.m.
6   on a Tuesday afternoon.


7   this is what some of the armies
8   died to save
9   this is what many of the ladies
10   desire:
11   these stuffed fractions
12   non-beings
13   pedaling along
14   or stopping to chat while
15   still seated upon their bikes
16   gentle breezes touching
17   undisturbed faces.


18   I understand very little of this
19   except maybe the armies killed the
20   wrong people
21   but they usually do:
22   they think the enemy are
23   those they are directed against
24   instead of those who
25   direct them:
26   the fathers of the
27   darlings.

        Bukowski, Charles :  a strange moment [from War All the Time:
        Poems, 1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   as I was walking through this parking
2   lot
3   I saw a crowd gathered about two men
4   bloodied
5   in a fist fight
6   they were cursing and
7   they were breathing
8   heavily;
9   then one man caught a punch in the
10   mouth
11   crashed backwards into a
12   yellow Mercedes
13   bounced back
14   dug his fist into the other man's
15   gut.


16   I hated that crowd
17   they were watching like spectators at
18   a cockfight.
19   I pushed through
20   got between the men
21   caught a fist on the right
22   temple.


23   "all right," I said, "that's
24   enough, it's over."


25   they stood looking at each
26   other.


27   "that's it, go your
28   ways ..."


29   one guy turned away but the other
30   guy charged,


31   "you son of a bitch!"

[Page 171 ]




32   I caught him and held him
33   back ...


34   "that's /it/ , buddy, don't be
35   an asshole ..."


36   for a moment it looked as if
37   he was going to swing on
38   me
39   then he put his hands
40   down and walked away through
41   the crowd.


42   I walked to my car
43   got in
44   started it
45   thinking, now what did
46   you do that for?
47   that was none of your
48   business


49   but I was smiling


50   I had altered a bit of
51   ugliness
52   into something
53   else
54   even though
55   such an act
56   was against
57   whatever vague
58   philosophy
59   I had
60   personal or
61   otherwise ...


62   and pulling out of the
63   parking lot
64   and into traffic
65   it was crowded

[Page 172 ]




66   and preparing to make a
67   lane change
68   I reached for the
69   blinker lever
70   touched the wrong
71   one
72   and my windshield wipers
73   began lashing
74   about
75   and then I
76   laughed: back to
77   normal: it sure felt
78   more
79   real.

        Bukowski, Charles :  beauti-ful [from War All the Time: Poems,
        1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   one poet used to take
2   this stringy-haired blonde around
3   with him to poetry readings
4   and
5   she'd sit out in the audience
6   and now and then
7   just as he concluded a
8   poem
9   the blonde would
10   breathlessly say:
11   "beauti-ful ..."


12   it made him look good
13   and I was a little jealous
14   of it
15   myself:
16   nobody had ever said that
17   about
18   one of my poems


19   and each time
20   after she said,
21   "beauti-ful ..."
22   it made them
23   applaud.


24   he had her planted at
25   all his readings
26   this poet who was so good
27   with the ladies
28   he had a
29   gentle smile and
30   these artistic
31   dangling
32   hands
33   and he dangled
34   very well
35   elsewhere

[Page 174 ]



36   it was
37   told.


38   I attended these readings
39   because I was living with a
40   sex-pot who /insisted/ upon
41   going to them
42   and since our affair was
43   still fresh and
44   new
45   I made certain horrible
46   sacrifices


47   and /he/ was reading
48   everywhere
49   in every little pitiful
50   hand-out
51   poetry hole in L.A.
52   and nearby
53   parts.


54   this one night
55   he had a new girl planted
56   in the audience
57   a tinted redhead
58   wearing fisherman's boots
59   and a cowboy hat
60   with a two-and-one-half foot
61   red feather
62   but she was as good as the
63   other:
64   at certain times
65   after certain poems
66   she too would utter the
67   word:
68   "beauti-ful!"


69   and the applause would

[Page 175 ]


70   follow ...


71   an hour later he was still
72   tirelessly going
73   on, and then he finished
74   one
75   and his new plant said it
76   again:
77   "beauti-ful ..."


78   and then it came
79   from the rear
80   from one of the back
81   seats:
82   " /No, it wasn't, it was a/
83   /piece of shit!/ "


84   it was the stringy-blonde
85   standing up on
86   one of the seats
87   holding her paper cup
88   full of
89   Thunderbird


90   and then the applause came
91   it came and it
92   rose and it
93   rumbled
94   it was perfect and endearing
95   and unashamed


96   /he/ had never heard applause
97   like
98   that ...

                    



99   and after that night

[Page 176 ]


100   maybe a week later
101   I was alone
102   sitting up against the
103   headboard of the bed
104   the sex-pot was out
105   to a reading or
106   somewhere
107   and I was into another
108   beer
109   going through one of
110   those
111   throwaway tabloids
112   when I came across this
113   short notice
114   that a certain poet
115   had left for
116   New York City
117   to seek his fame and
118   fortune
119   there.


120   a beauti-ful city for a
121   beauti-ful guy, I thought,
122   bundling the tabloid
123   and dumping a 3 pointer into
124   the far-off
125   basket ...

        Bukowski, Charles :  frozen food section [from War All the Time:
        Poems, 1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   he'd been fighting it for years:
2   that thing about
3   women in the supermarkets bending
4   over
5   or just
6   pushing their carts along---
7   he felt like grabbing a
8   buttock
9   and squeezing---
10   hardly a sexual
11   thing,
12   more like a weird joke,
13   just something else to do
14   besides the ordinary,
15   more in camaraderie than
16   desire;
17   he didn't know why his mind worked
18   that way
19   and he realized that
20   one of the niceties of
21   civilization
22   was the right to
23   unmolested privacy,
24   but there he was
25   rolling along
26   and he passed a lady
27   bending over in the
28   frozen food section
29   (she wasn't attractive:
30   her cheeks sagged beneath a
31   loose housedress)
32   and he saw his hand
33   go out---
34   there it goes, he
35   thought---
36   and the hand
37   grabbed
38   one of the buttocks

[Page 178 ]


39   and squeezed,
40   then
41   let go ...
42   it had felt like
43   an old beachball
44   underinflated
45   soft,
46   and he looked back
47   and smiled,
48   and the lady
49   screamed---
50   it was the scream
51   of one being murdered---
52   then after the tick of a
53   second
54   she stopped and yelled:
55   " /That son of a bitch/
56   /assaulted me!/ "
57   (she pointed the deathly
58   finger attached to the end of her trembling
59   right arm at him)
60   " /He grabbed my ass!/ "


61   he saw a fat man in a
62   yellow sweater and orange
63   walking shorts
64   running
65   toward him ...
66   the fat man's face
67   was florid with
68   indignation.
69   the fat man circled
70   him
71   got an armlock on
72   him
73   from behind
74   jammed his shoulder up
75   into his neck

[Page 179 ]


76   yelling,
77   " /What's the matter/
78   /with you, buddy?/ "
79   the fat man had the most
80   terrible case of body
81   odor,
82   it was worse than the
83   pain in his
84   arm,
85   then out of nowhere
86   a cop arrived
87   and he heard the handcuffs
88   click
89   behind him
90   then felt the vicious
91   grip of the
92   cuffs
93   and a rap
94   behind his ear.


95   he was dragged through the
96   supermarket
97   and then outside.
98   it was early evening going into
99   night
100   and he was shoved into
101   the back seat of
102   the police car.


103   the faces of the crowd
104   looked in
105   at him
106   as the cop in front
107   spoke into the
108   radio
109   the red lights
110   whirled
111   and he remembered

[Page 180 ]


112   the last thing
113   Meg had said:
114   "don't forget the
115   paprika, I /know/
116   you're going to
117   forget the
118   paprika ..."

        Bukowski, Charles :  how do they get your number? [from War All

1   the dogs of hell have claws like cats
2   and faces like women
3   and the doors of hell have numbers on
4   them
5   upside down
6   and to get through them
7   you have to walk with your hands
8   using your legs like giant
9   antennae:
10   in hell they give the answers
11   first
12   and ask the questions
13   later;
14   in hell you're always in love
15   with nothing to love,
16   and something hates you
17   for all the wrong reasons;
18   the cats of hell are all
19   bunghole
20   so dry
21   they want to wink but
22   can't
23   your father rules hell and your mother
24   licks his toes;
25   in this hell, it's never night
26   it's always morning
27   you're always getting up to the
28   sound of stinking alarms,
29   it's morning
30   more and more
31   leprous light like
32   the worst of your memories;
33   in this hell, there are no flames
34   just this moment
35   dangling intestines nailed to
36   mutilated palms
37   and the phone rings and

[Page 182 ]


38   you pick it up
39   and somebody speaks through the
40   instrument
41   at 8:35 a.m.
42   "are you the poet,
43   Chinaski?
44   we all love you here and we
45   want you to read at our
46   bookstore ...
47   all the beer you can drink, and
48   who knows? you old fuck, maybe
49   we can even find a piece of ass
50   for you somewhere! ha, ha, ha ..."

        Bukowski, Charles :  the old gang [from War All the Time: Poems,
        1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   of course, we were all fucked-up, I was suicidal but hitting the
2   shit out of the typer,
3   couldn't pick anything up off the floor: shirts, bottles, shorts,
4   towels, socks, cans,
5   I walked about naked and barefoot
6   stepping onto shards of glass
7   sometimes feeling it
8   sometimes not.
9   at times I tried to pick some of it
10   out
11   but I didn't want to get it all
12   because I'd read somewhere that the glass could work its way
13   through the bloodstream to the
14   heart and kill
15   you, yes ...


16   there was a girl in and out,
17   a semi-girlfriend called K.
18   she came along mostly
19   but sometimes with a thin mad lady
20   called Sunflower,
21   and sometimes K. arrived with her
22   brother N.,
23   or sometimes all 3 arrived at
24   once.
25   anyhow, K. and N. and Sunflower were
26   all on drugs:
27   blacks, reds, yellows, whites,
28   coke.
29   I had a coke dealer who cut it so
30   fine
31   you got a headache just looking at
32   a line.
33   I was also on scotch, beer, wine
34   hitting the shit out of the typer
35   with K. and N. and Sunflower
36   banging on my door
37   usually at 4 or 5 a.m.

[Page 184 ]


38   when I was up
39   anyhow.
40   they were more like sharks from hell
41   than friends
42   but K. had a fine body and very long red
43   hair
44   and she laid it on me
45   just often enough to keep me on her
46   leash.


47   meanwhile
48   I kept hitting the shit out of the typer
49   and some luck started
50   moneywise
51   which enabled me to escape that
52   neighborhood
53   and move to a small town down the
54   coast
55   where I continued to hit the shit out of
56   the typer,
57   even going back once to see K.
58   who was drying out in her mother's
59   home
60   and as she sat on the edge of her
61   bed
62   I told her,
63   "it's over between us, I don't know how
64   you got that grab on me ..."


65   what a gang they had been,
66   driving their cars without pink
67   slips, license plates, driver's
68   licenses, just ripping and roaring, waiting
69   for the next drug
70   hit.


71   last I heard, they were clean,
72   Sunflower had
73   vanished,

[Page 185 ]


74   but K. and her brother N.
75   surfaced in a recent issue of a national
76   magazine
77   sober
78   speaking as reliable sources
79   about my life
80   literary and
81   otherwise.
82   not that they were unkind, just
83   inaccurate.
84   it's well that they didn't
85   o.d.
86   but I hope it's their last
87   hurrah
88   regarding me,
89   and I'll never again quite
90   believe
91   what other people say
92   about
93   writers.

1   some dogs who sleep at night
2   must dream of bones
3   and I remember your bones
4   in flesh
5   and best
6   in that dark green dress
7   and those high-heeled bright
8   black shoes,
9   you always cursed when you
10   drank,
11   your hair coming down you
12   wanted to explode out of
13   what was holding you:
14   rotten memories of a
15   rotten
16   past, and
17   you finally got
18   out
19   by dying,
20   leaving me with the
21   rotten
22   present;
23   you've been dead
24   28 years
25   yet I remember you
26   better than any of
27   the rest;
28   you were the only one
29   who understood
30   the futility of the
31   arrangement of
32   life;
33   all the others were only
34   displeased with
35   trivial segments,
36   carped
37   nonsensically about

[Page 187 ]


38   nonsense;
39   Jane, you were
40   killed by
41   knowing too much.
42   here's a drink
43   to your bones
44   that
45   this dog
46   still
47   dreams about.

        Bukowski, Charles :  sky sign [from War All the Time: Poems,

1   the falcons have come to the city
2   and are swooping down
3   carrying off the pigeons.
4   the dogs and cats
5   look back and
6   run for cover
7   as a moving shadow falls
8   between them
9   and the sun.


10   I too am worried
11   stand beneath a palm leaf
12   and light a cigarette.


13   I watch the falcon glide
14   gracefully
15   above the telephone wires,
16   it is a beautiful
17   thing
18   that falcon
19   from this distance,
20   and, of course,
21   it makes me think
22   of death
23   and death is perfectly
24   proper
25   yet I throw my cigarette
26   down
27   stamp it out,
28   look up at the bird:
29   "you son-of-a-bitch ..."


30   I turn
31   walk through the doorway
32   and into the house
33   as the telephone
34   rings.

        Bukowski, Charles :  a valentine gift [from War All the Time:
        Poems, 1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I sit looking dumbly at this stuffed red devil on my desk. I am in
2   a fix. it
3   gets like this
4   sometimes: the magic is elsewhere.


5   it was with old man Shoemaker at the races
6   today: he rode the first four winners:
7   3/5, 2 to one, 6 to one, 8 to one.


8   you know, sometimes I run out of the money all
9   night: the poems rear up in the gate, break
10   their legs, run the wrong way, never finish


11   but it's the fault of the jock: he's got his
12   ass on backwards, his mind is up in the palm
13   trees.


14   maybe my problem is that I had 5 winners at
15   the track today. maybe that's all I think
16   I need.


17   I knew a guy once who wrote and he too
18   often went to the track. he always had
19   the same story for me: "I went bust! I
20   even blew the bus money home! Jesus Christ,
21   I had to walk /five/ miles!"


22   then he'd get to his room and write and
23   he'd go bust
24   all over again.


25   well, I think the idea of the track or the
26   roulette wheel or whatever else is around is
27   so that we don't have to sit around all day
28   thinking, I am a writer.


29   and the idea of sitting down to the typer
30   is the same, you don't want to sit there

[Page 190 ]


31   thinking, I am a writer ...


32   the stuffed red devil looks at me and it
33   looks like me: fat nose, slit eyes, surly
34   grin


35   as some guy on the radio plays bad piano
36   music all over us
37   the son of a bitch looks drunk as
38   his forked tail rests upon a
39   piece of
40   blank typing paper.

2   yet drinking
3   living in a cheap

5   always behind
6   in the rent
7   there wasn't
8   much else to
9   do
10   but screw


11   and I was
12   working away
13   pumping
14   pumping
15   determined to
16   make it


17   I had failed
18   at
19   everything
20   else


21   I wanted to
22   make it
23   at /that/


24   I groaned
25   pumped
26   flailed


27   5 minutes
28   ten minutes


29   so near
30   so near


31   it was so

[Page 192 ]


32   ridiculous
33   in a certain
34   sense


35   and
36   finally
37   I felt myself
38   nearing a
39   climax


40   victory
41   at last


42   and
43   /at the exact moment/
44   I climaxed


45   for no reason
46   the alarm clock
47   went off


48   and I rolled
49   off of her
50   laughing and
51   spurting


52   and she asked
53   angrily, "what's
54   the matter
55   with you?"


56   and that made
57   it
58   worse


59   I kept laughing
60   and she ran
61   to the bathroom

[Page 193 ]




62   slammed the
63   door


64   and I
65   wiped off
66   on the sheet


67   as the clock
68   sat there
69   innocently
70   reading:
71   2:30 p.m.

        Bukowski, Charles :  macho man [from War All the Time: Poems,

1   the phone rings.
2   I answer.
3   it's a woman.
4   she says,
5   "you are a sick
6   fucker and I thought
7   I'd tell you
8   that ..."


9   she hangs up.


10   I am supposedly
11   unlisted.


12   it rings
13   again.


14   "you wrote this
15   macho bullshit
16   but you're
17   probably a
18   fag, you
19   probably want to
20   suck
21   black dick!"


22   she hangs
23   up.


24   I am watching
25   the Johnny Carson
26   Show.
27   he amuses
28   me,
29   he's so
30   straight-backed
31   dressed in his
32   high school

[Page 195 ]


33   go-to-dance
34   suit.
35   he touches
36   his nose
37   his necktie
38   the back of
39   his neck.
40   he's a dead
41   giveaway:
42   he wants
43   desperately
44   to be all right
45   just like his
46   audience.


47   it rings again.


48   "you don't know
49   what a /real/
50   woman is!
51   if you ever met
52   a /real/ woman
53   you wouldn't know
54   what to do
55   with her!"


56   she hangs
57   up.


58   Carson jokes about
59   his jokes being
60   so bad
61   but he has probably
62   consumed and
63   murdered
64   more writers than
65   Bobby Hope.

[Page 196 ]



66   then /she's/
67   back:
68   "why do you keep listening to
69   me?
70   why don't you
71   hang up?"


72   I hang up
73   then take
74   the phone
75   off the
76   hook.


77   Carson has
78   finished his
79   monologue.
80   smiles.
81   is delicately
82   concerned
83   yet
84   pleased.
85   he goes into
86   his little golf
87   swing
88   as the commercial
89   descends
90   upon
91   me.


92   it's just another

111   remote control

116   away
117   and reach for
118   the pages of

1   think: if Ludwig were alive today
2   tooling along in his red sports
3   car
4   roof down
5   he'd pick up all these mad
6   hard cases on the boulevards
7   we'd get music like we
8   never heard before
9   and he'd still never
10   ever find his
11   Beloved.

        Bukowski, Charles :  how I got started [from War All the Time:
        Poems, 1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   it has taken me decades to realize
2   why I was usually chosen over the
3   6 or 7 candidates for those
4   paltry shipping clerk jobs
5   in those small business houses
6   across the nation.
7   first, I was big---
8   which meant I could lift heavy
9   objects.
10   second, I was ugly---
11   which meant I was no threat to
12   the secretaries.
13   third, I looked dumb---
14   which meant I was too stupid
15   to steal.


16   if I had been running a business
17   and a guy like me had come to apply
18   for a job
19   I would have hired him
20   right away.


21   which is rather
22   the way I ended up anyhow
23   in another kind of
24   business.

        Bukowski, Charles :  Krutz [from War All the Time: Poems,
        1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I was in Mannheim when my agent phoned me
2   at the hotel, he said Krutz wanted to have
3   dinner with the whole gang, and I told
4   my agent, o.k.
5   I thought that was very nice of Krutz
6   because it was a large gang---my agent, my
7   girlfriend, a French movie producer and his
8   girlfriend, and also
9   3 or 4 other people who were hanging on,
10   maybe more than 3 or 4.


11   the next evening found us at the most
12   expensive restaurant in town, at a large
13   reserved table with a head waiter and 2 or
14   3 additional waiters.


15   Krutz had his girlfriend with him and we
16   had drinks and appetizers, then some-
17   body remarked how young Krutz was to be
18   a leading publisher in Germany.
19   Krutz just smiled around his
20   cigar.


21   Krutz published me.
22   I smiled around my
23   cigarette.


24   my agent was there with his wife; I don't
25   know how many were at the table, perhaps
26   12, and I thought what a good guy
27   Krutz was, not only for publishing me
28   but also for wining and dining all these
29   people.


30   everybody ordered, drank, and waited;
31   the food was slow to arrive and the
32   bottles of wine emptied and more arrived via
33   those gently smiling waiters, and we

[Page 201 ]


34   all laughed and talked and smoked and
35   drank,
36   and then the food arrived---such magic:
37   frogs legs, crab legs, steaks so tender you
38   could cut them with your fork; and lobsters,
39   all manner of strange foodstuffs---onions,
40   greens, creams and gravies, olives, pickles,
41   delightful unknown specialties;
42   and hot bread so soft the butter ran through;
43   it was royal food, food beyond our ken,
44   and we ate and drank, and finally finished,
45   and then we drank some more,
46   they ran out of our favorite
47   wine and we ordered a new one, and then
48   it began to get late, quite late, and the waiters
49   were slower and slower bringing the bottles and
50   they were no longer smiling, and soon we stopped
51   laughing and just talked, and then the
52   bottles stopped arriving;
53   the head waiter walked up and placed the
54   bill in the center of the table on a large silver
55   platter
56   and it just sat there
57   as the waiters stood and waited as
58   we waited.


59   the bill was near Krutz and we all watched
60   Krutz but he didn't reach
61   except into his coat where he ex-
62   tracted a large and expensive cigar ...
63   he took the cigar and leisurely began licking
64   it, turning and licking it, then
65   he came with the lighter, stuck the cigar
66   into his mouth, lit it, inhaled contentedly,
67   exhaling a slow and beautiful stream of gentle blue
68   aromatic smoke ...


69   then he waited.

[Page 202 ]


70   the message was obvious
71   to almost everybody.


72   I looked at my agent, but he was immune to the
73   tragedy, he was smiling and talking to
74   somebody.


75   I didn't have the money
76   and I looked around the table:
77   it was an unbelievable scene as my girlfriend poked
78   her elbow into my side whispering, "what the hell's
79   going on?"


80   Krutz leaned further back in his chair, sucked,
81   blew out another langorous stream of blue smoke.
82   then, suddenly, the waiters came forward, removed
83   all the plates, all the bottles, and all that was
84   left were our empty wine glasses and our ashtrays.
85   we all sat there and the waiters waited and the
86   head waiter waited and there was no more laughing,
87   no more talking (well, my agent was still busy
88   talking and smiling away at somebody).
89   it was agony, it was dirty dirty agony while
90   Krutz smoked ...


91   finally, the French director saved us all, he waved
92   his credit card and the head waiter moved in for the
93   kill ...

                    



94   we were able to leave then and we met later
95   outside near the automobiles where Krutz lit a fresh
96   cigar and his girlfriend gave me a bag of apples
97   from their garden
98   which I
99   thanked them for ...

[Page 203 ]



                    



100   back at the hotel
101   my girlfriend and I each
102   ate an apple
103   and she said,
104   "these are great apples, these German apples ..."
105   and I said,
106   "yes, they are."


107   and when she went to the bathroom
108   I took my drink and the bag of apples and
109   I went out on the balcony ...
110   we were on the top floor
111   and I hurled the apples
112   one by one
113   into the night
114   into the street
115   and toward the park
116   and grabbing the last apple
117   I really zoomed it
118   almost going over the side
119   myself
120   but, of course, I didn't
121   and I turned and walked back
122   in there
123   feeling better
124   but not
125   much.

1   he sits there
2   big in his chair
3   contented
4   and he tells me he
5   walked out on a
6   wife and two kids
7   changed his name
8   started all over
9   again.

        Bukowski, Charles :  dear pa and ma [from War All the Time:
        Poems, 1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   my father liked Edgar Allan
2   Poe
3   and my mother liked /The/
4   /Saturday Evening Post/
5   and she died first
6   the priest waving smoking
7   incense above her
8   casket
9   and my father followed
10   a year or so later
11   and in that purple velvet coffin
12   his face looked like ice
13   painted yellow


14   my father never liked
15   what I wrote: "people
16   don't want to read this
17   sort of thing."


18   "yes, Henry," said my
19   mother, "people like to
20   read things that make
21   them happy."


22   they were my earliest
23   literary critics
24   and
25   they both were
26   right.

        Bukowski, Charles :  not all that bad [from War All the Time:
        Poems, 1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   was sitting here, drinking a glass of
2   wine
3   the phone rang, I left the drink
4   to answer in the other
5   room.
6   came back in a few minutes
7   sat down
8   picked up the glass
9   felt something moving in my
10   mouth,
11   /Jesus Christ!/
12   I spit it out into the
13   ashtray:
14   a fly
15   wiggling there ...
16   I picked up the wine glass,
17   walked into the bathroom
18   dumped the contents,
19   then the glass slipped out of
20   my hand
21   and rattled in the wash basin.
22   I rinsed out my mouth, the glass,
23   then walked back in
24   poured a new drink.
25   the fly was still wiggling ...
26   there we were,
27   a wino fly and a wino man
28   at 1:30 a.m.
29   and now there's another fly
30   whirling and buzzing
31   above me
32   no doubt wanting to join
33   the party.
34   well, it could be worse:
35   I could be drinking with
36   things that can't
37   fly
38   either with their bodies

[Page 207 ]


39   or any other
40   way.
41   and you can't
42   spit /them/
43   out.

        Bukowski, Charles :  dogs [from War All the Time: Poems,
        1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   someplace in Arizona
2   at the dog
3   races.


4   the dogs were
5   great
6   and the boys
7   led them out
8   on the track
9   junior highschool boys
10   in orange jackets
11   who should have been home
12   studying
13   contemporary history or
14   biology.


15   the night was
16   calm
17   the track looped in front
18   of those jagged
19   mountains
20   that stood above those
21   lizard-and-snake-crawled
22   sands,
23   the track was my
24   El Dorado and the crowd was
25   small
26   and I came up with
27   75% winners
28   none the actual
29   betting
30   favorite.


31   and as she drove me back
32   she was silent.
33   she knew I hadn't been thinking
34   of her
35   although I had once loved her

[Page 209 ]


36   very much, and I felt sad
37   for /her/ ,
38   she was very straight at the
39   wheel
40   her hair falling into her
41   face,
42   she said, "now I guess you want
43   to get drunk?"


44   "of course,"
45   I said.


46   she was always pissed and that
47   pissed her more and she hit the throttle
48   and the speedometer on her dash only went to
49   85
50   and the needle went past that
51   and my window was open and the
52   air rushed in
53   and the mountains sped by
54   and cars leaped aside as she
55   approached
56   but a jack rabbit didn't make
57   it---
58   one the dogs had failed
59   to catch---
60   and the dead carcass was
61   thrown against the
62   windshield,
63   there was a splash of
64   blood and then the carcass was
65   gone, and I thought, fuck it, death
66   I accept
67   you.


68   but it didn't happen, we
69   skidded to a stop
70   in front of her court

[Page 210 ]


71   and we got out
72   and went inside
73   where her sister was
74   waiting,
75   and we sat there for
76   several hours
77   talking
78   laughing
79   drinking tea
80   (for them)
81   wine for
82   me
83   talking and
84   laughing
85   as if everything was
86   all right
87   instead of mutilated
88   and murdered
89   forever.

        Bukowski, Charles :  hey, Ezra, listen to this [from War All the
        Time: Poems, 1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I think I learned much about writing when
2   I read those issues of /The Kenyon Review/
3   over 40 years ago
4   the light of the starving library room
5   falling across my starving hands
6   holding fat pages full of
7   deliberate glorious
8   rancor


9   those critics


10   those spoiled fat gnats
11   bellicose


12   very fine energy
13   more fulfilling than my
14   park bench


15   I learned that words could
16   beat the hell out of
17   anything


18   they were
19   better than paint
20   better than music
21   better than clay
22   stone
23   or their
24   counterparts


25   yet
26   wasn't it strange
27   that all I wanted to do then was
28   lift the skirt of the librarian and
29   look at her legs and
30   grab her panties?


31   I didn't do it.

[Page 212 ]




32   literary fame can be the consequence
33   of knowing
34   when to go wild
35   and how.

        Bukowski, Charles :  truce [from War All the Time: Poems,
        1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   I need to walk down a sidewalk
2   somewhere
3   on a shady afternoon
4   find a table
5   outside a cafe
6   sit down
7   order a drink
8   and I want to sit there
9   with that drink
10   and I want
11   a fly to land
12   on that table.
13   then
14   in the background
15   I want to hear somebody
16   laugh.
17   then
18   I want to see
19   a woman walk by
20   in a green dress.
21   I want to see
22   a dog walk by
23   a fat dog
24   with short brown hair and
25   with grinning eyes.
26   I want to die
27   sitting there.
28   I want to die
29   upright
30   my eyes still
31   open.
32   I want an airplane
33   to fly overhead.
34   I want a woman
35   to walk by
36   in a blue dress.
37   then I want
38   that same fat dog

[Page 214 ]


39   with short brown hair and
40   grinning eyes
41   to come walking by
42   again.
43   that will be
44   enough
45   after all the
46   other
47   after everything
48   else.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the gentleman and the bastard [from War All
        the Time: Poems, 1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the L.A. Rams in those days had
2   what some call color---
3   each game seemed to go down to
4   the last second
5   always before crowds of
6   100,000 in the good times of
7   the fifties.


8   it seemed that the team
9   who had the ball
10   last
11   won the game.


12   the Rams had two great
13   ends: Tom Fears and
14   Crazy Legs Hirsch
15   and two
16   huge grinding fullbacks:
17   Tank Younger and
18   Deacon Dan Towler


19   and two
20   quarterbacks:
21   Bob Waterfield and
22   Norm Van Brocklin.


23   Waterfield
24   being from U.C.L.A.
25   was the starter
26   got the good
27   press


28   he was
29   talented and a
30   gentleman


31   but his
32   back-up

[Page 216 ]



33   Dutch
34   Van Brocklin
35   was a nasty
36   backwoods s.o.b.
37   without a good word
38   for
39   anybody


40   but after Waterfield
41   got the team
42   in the
43   hole


44   here would come
45   Dutch
46   halfway through the
47   third quarter
48   or more often
49   at the beginning
50   of the
51   fourth


52   fresh and
53   mean


54   points
55   behind
56   going for broke
57   throwing
58   for broke


59   those high
60   towering
61   passes, perfectly
62   leading his
63   swift ends
64   time after
65   time

[Page 217 ]


66   always fighting
67   the clock


68   and then
69   with the other team
70   dropping back
71   for the
72   pass


73   here would come
74   Younger or
75   Towler
76   straight up the
77   middle
78   breaking through
79   tacklers as if
80   they were cotton-
81   wood
82   branches.


83   Dutch pulled out
84   many a game
85   and if he didn't
86   win it
87   he came so
88   close
89   you could cry
90   with fury
91   at that last
92   perfect pass
93   dropped as the
94   gun
95   went off.


96   Waterfield vs.
97   Van Brocklin
98   they called it The
99   Great Quarterback

[Page 218 ]


100   Debate.


101   he press sided
102   with Waterfield
103   but the facts and
104   the drama sided
105   with
106   Dutch


107   always working
108   against the
109   clock
110   cursing his
111   linemen in the
112   huddle
113   for missed
114   blocks
115   cursing his
116   ends for not
117   getting down-
118   field fast
119   enough


120   he was the
121   guy from
122   out of
123   town
124   trying to
125   clean up the
126   mess


127   he wanted to
128   get it
129   done
130   somehow


131   no matter
132   what the

[Page 219 ]


133   hell


134   and he
135   usually
136   did.


137   early this
138   year
139   long before his
140   time
141   Waterfield
142   died


143   and still
144   playing
145   backup
146   Dutch died
147   90 days
148   later.


149   Waterfield was
150   a very fine
151   player
152   but there was never
153   any Great Quarterback
154   Debate
155   for me.


156   my heart went
157   out
158   to Dutch


159   and I haven't
160   been
161   to any Ram
162   games
163   since.

        Bukowski, Charles :  bad action [from War All the Time: Poems,
        1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I got a seat down front and started
2   working on my figures
3   and a man in a red shirt and red
4   pants
5   sat down two seats away
6   opened a brown paper bag
7   and began chewing on a sandwich and
8   potato chips.
9   I got up, moved several seats
10   away,
11   then I heard a man's voice behind
12   me:
13   "let's see, there are seven of us,
14   aren't there?"
15   and there were: women and men and
16   children.


17   I walked downstairs to the crapper,
18   found a booth, closed the door,
19   sat down and began working on my
20   figures again.


21   there was a rap from the stall to
22   my left:
23   "hey buddy. ... hey, buddy!"


24   "yeah?" I answered.


25   "get down on your knees, slip your
26   cock under the partition and I'll
27   give you the best blow job you
28   ever had!"


29   I got out of there fast, went back
30   upstairs, found a seat, sat down
31   and then I felt something under my
32   right foot: a dead wren.
33   another reminder of death.

[Page 221 ]




34   the public address system
35   came on:
36   "Ladies and Gentlemen, the Flag of
37   the United States of America!"


38   we all stood up.
39   the flag went up.
40   we all sat down.


41   sometimes being at the racetrack
42   is worse than being in the
43   county jail.

15   just as in the 30's
16   their elders had come here
17   from Oklahoma
18   in the same way


19   now they're going back
20   to Oklahoma
21   with California accents


22   Grandchildren of the
23   Dust Bowl


24   because Japanese cars are

        Bukowski, Charles :  my friend [from War All the Time: Poems,
        1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I loved bar room fights.
2   I fought the biggest meanest men
3   I could find.
4   the patrons thought I was
5   brave.


6   but it was something else, something
7   that walked and slept and sat with
8   me. it ate with me when I ate,
9   it drank with me when I drank.
10   I saw it everywhere: in loaves
11   of bread, on the back of a mouse
12   running up the wall, I saw it through
13   torn window shades, I saw it
14   in the bodies of beautiful women;
15   I never saw it in the sun but I saw it
16   in the rain and I noted it in in-
17   sects; and I saw it riding in buses
18   and trolley cars;
19   I saw it in the dresser drawer when I
20   pulled it open,
21   I saw it in the faces of
22   bosses with their dumb wet lips and
23   little rivet eyes: blue, brown,
24   green;
25   I heard it in the click of timeclocks,
26   saw it spread like powder across the
27   faces of my landladies;
28   I saw it on bar
29   stairways
30   leading to the 2nd
31   floor of some rooming house in
32   Houston, in New Orleans, in St. Louis,
33   in L.A., in Frisco;
34   and I saw it in the doorknobs and I saw
35   it in the rooms, sitting on the
36   beds
37   waiting nicely ...

[Page 225 ]


38   and in some bar
39   after hours of drinking
40   somebody says, "hey, Hank, you
41   ever tried Big Eddie?"
42   Big Eddie grins, I see it in his
43   teeth, I finish my beer,
44   nod at him, get up, walk to
45   the rear entrance, Big Eddie and
46   the crowd following, and outside
47   I see it in the moon and the
48   bricks
49   as the patrons lay their bets
50   I am the underdog, and as Big
51   Eddie charges I see it in his
52   feet and on the buttons of
53   his shirt and I hear a horn
54   sound somewhere far off, and
55   it's as decent a thing as a man
56   can know.

5   old Charlie


6   he runs the

10   garage


11   his wife
12   screams and
13   nags at

15   so
16   he has

29   I go over
30   to see
31   old Charlie

[Page 227 ]




32   I'm in
33   trouble of
34   sorts
35   and I
36   find him
37   in his
38   CAPTAIN'S
39   QUARTERS


40   he's nearly
41   totally
42   deaf


43   I have to
44   scream
45   so he can
46   hear:


47   /"Hey, you got/
48   /a crowbar/
49   /I can/
50   /use?"/


51   "try
52   my wife,"
53   he says.


54   I yell
55   again:


56   /"I need a/
57   /crowbar!"/


58   "oh," he
59   smiles,
60   "I thought
61   you said
62   'a crow'."

[Page 228 ]




63   I thank
64   him
65   tell him
66   that's not
67   what
68   I want


69   and leave
70   him
71   there
72   sorting
73   among the
74   thumbscrews
75   and
76   the
77   ten penny
78   nails


79   some
80   guy
81   old Charlie


82   oblivious to
83   solutions


84   yet


85   alone
86   like the
87   mountain over
88   the sea


89   he makes
90   a little
91   of the darkness
92   retreat.

        Bukowski, Charles :  girls [from War All the Time: Poems,
        1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I used to spend 3 days a week
2   driving one or the other of the
3   girls to various pharmacies
4   on Hollywood Boulevard.


5   how they got their prescriptions
6   I don't know
7   whether they fucked their
8   doctors or murdered somebody
9   I don't know


10   but they got them.
11   it was some circus.


12   one of the girls
13   phoned me: "Eddie is trying
14   to get my prescription! tell
15   Eddie to leave me alone!"


16   I got Eddie on the phone and
17   told him that I was going to
18   kick his ass, that I was on my
19   way over to do just that.


20   Eddie was her brother.
21   he lived there.


22   when I got there
23   he was gone.


24   "he couldn't find the pre-
25   scription," she told me, "I
26   had it in my mouth. I almost
27   swallowed it ..."


28   she showed me the wadded wet piece of
29   paper, unfolded it and said,
30   "let's go ..."

[Page 230 ]




31   I don't know what it meant to
32   me.
33   usually it meant that when we got
34   back to my place and I took
35   some pills with the booze
36   I'd do something stupid
37   like busting out the
38   bathroom mirror or
39   slicing up my coffee table
40   with my buck knife.
41   although the girls looked
42   fairly good
43   there was not much sex
44   involved


45   it meant
46   letting one or the other of them
47   out of my car
48   at the prescription department
49   of some cheap pharmacy on
50   Hollywood Boulevard
51   at 10:35 a.m.
52   then looking for parking
53   finding one of them later
54   wobbling on high heels
55   looking helpless
56   but really totally vicious
57   snarling off any stupid dreamers
58   in the sidewalk mob


59   then seeing me,
60   moving forward
61   to another day and night
62   of pills and
63   alcohol
64   uppers downers
65   vodka wine beer brandy
66   it didn't matter

[Page 231 ]


67   until we were petrified
68   out of existence


69   until the next
70   time.

        Bukowski, Charles :  ass but no class [from War All the Time:
        Poems, 1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   one time
2   there was Rene who
3   had me drive her to a
4   department store
5   just before Xmas
6   and we walked around
7   as she stocked her
8   shopping cart with
9   little goodies, then
10   she said, "listen, I
11   can't pay for these
12   things, can you buy
13   them for me?"
14   "nothin' doin',"
15   I told her.
16   "listen," she said,
17   "you buy this stuff
18   and I'll fuck you
19   like you never been
20   fucked before."
21   so, I paid.
22   it came to
23   $145.63


24   at the counter she
25   happened to meet
26   her friends,
27   Jeff and Clara
28   and they
29   talked.


30   "listen," she finally
31   told them, "why don't
32   we all go to Hank's and
33   have a drink?"


34   we went.
35   we sat around with the

[Page 233 ]


36   drinks.
37   we drank those and had
38   some more.
39   Jeff and Clara
40   didn't leave.
41   I saw Rene lean over
42   to Clara one time and
43   whisper something to
44   her.


45   I got it.
46   she was saying, don't
47   leave me here alone with
48   him.


49   they all sat about
50   and then Clara and Jeff
51   said they had to leave
52   and Rene said she had to
53   leave too.


54   I left it
55   like that.
56   I let Rene leave.


57   she took her purchases
58   with her.


59   she was a young girl
60   and I was an old
61   man.


62   I watched them
63   walking away together
64   up the walk,
65   Rene with her
66   victorious
67   swish.

[Page 234 ]




68   we'd been to bed
69   2 or 3
70   times


71   she thought, now,
72   it was enough for me
73   if she came around
74   once in a while
75   wired on speed
76   while we played
77   Scrabble all
78   night.


79   as they walked away,
80   I thought,
81   what an /unimaginative/
82   whore,
83   she has just walked away
84   from a potential
85   $200,000.00


86   I walked into the kitchen
87   pulled out a beer,
88   had a hit
89   and relegated her to a
90   lifetime of poverty
91   worse than the one
92   that I was living
93   at the
94   moment.


[Page 235 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  overhead mirrors [from War All the Time:
        Poems, 1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I wouldn't say it was a particularly low time, it was
2   a time and I tried to adjust spiritually
3   to most matters.
4   which meant: not expecting much and not getting much.


5   but sickness is another matter.
6   I was living in a cheap court in Hollywood
7   in between women
8   and I was buying coke, really
9   low-grade crap, sniffing that with
10   beer and scotch.
11   I got mentally very depressed and physically
12   sick.
13   I couldn't eat.
14   it got so I just ingested
15   coke, scotch and beer.


16   one morning it really got to me, I was trembling,
17   having visions ...
18   I couldn't even drink water ...
19   I was
20   dying.


21   the only friends I had were a nudey dancer and
22   a guy who operated a porno bookstore. they
23   came by.


24   "listen, this is it," I told them, "I'm
25   dying ..."


26   "we'll fix you up," said the porno bookstore
27   guy (who was also selling me
28   the watered-down coke).
29   the nudey dancer shacked with him.


30   he came back with something pink in a
31   bottle.
32   "take this," he said.

[Page 236 ]




33   that was about noon.


34   about 6 p.m. the phone rang.
35   I picked it up.


36   "yes?"


37   it was the porno guy.
38   "Hank?"


39   "yes ..."


40   "listen, Babs and I aren't working tonight,
41   we're going to a motel with over-
42   head mirrors and X-rated tv, we're going to
43   relax and fuck."


44   "good luck ..."


45   "I know you're sick, so we're going to
46   give you the phone number at the
47   motel so you can call us in case of
48   trouble ..."


49   "sure ..."


50   "got a pencil?"


51   "yeh ..."


52   "it's ..."


53   he gave me the number.
54   I didn't have a pencil, I couldn't
55   move.


56   "thanks," I said.

[Page 237 ]



                    



57   it was one of those nights you remember.
58   (if you don't fight death it will
59   just move in.)
60   at times I
61   got up
62   and walked around
63   turned the radio off and on, flushed the toilet
64   now and then, ran all the faucets in the place,
65   then shut them off, turned the lights off and
66   on, got back on the bed, rested but not too long,
67   got up, sipped water out of the tap,
68   sat in a chair and took some coins
69   out of my pocket and counted them: 25, 26, 27
70   cents ...
71   I kept turning the water off and on, the lights
72   off and on, counting the coins and also very
73   sensibly putting one shoe parallel to the
74   other shoe and so forth ...
75   as I went about my business I noticed that the
76   clock hardly moved:
77   the time always the same: 3:21 a.m.
78   then all at once, within a
79   minute
80   I noticed light coming in under the blinds---
81   daylight arriving
82   and when I saw that
83   I felt a bit better
84   went to bed
85   and slept flat on my belly as
86   usual ...


87   the next night I was sitting on my couch
88   drinking a beer and eating a fried egg
89   sandwich between 2 slices of very dry
90   bread

[Page 238 ]




91   when


92   my friends
93   the nudey dancer and the porno guy
94   came in.


95   "how you feeling?" he asked.


96   "o.k., except it's my last beer and
97   I'm broke."


98   "shit, man, come on down to our place,
99   we got plenty of everything ..."


100   they did.
101   lovely place. I stayed with the beer
102   except for two vodka sevens and one little
103   yellow pill
104   and they had the stereo on
105   but not too loud
106   and I stayed
107   smoked two bombers
108   drank 18 or 19 beers
109   thanked them and walked back
110   home ...


111   the next morning I didn't puke.
112   I got up, took a good crap, took a
113   lukewarm bath, dressed and walked to the
114   corner of
115   Hollywood and Western
116   put a dime in the box
117   got a /Herald-Examiner/ ,
118   remembering decades back when there
119   was a newspaper in L.A.
120   called the /Herald-Express/ and another
121   called the /Examiner/
122   and they merged rather than

[Page 239 ]


123   kill each other off,
124   and carrying that paper back
125   I felt that I had lived a long
126   time
127   though not a very wonderful one,
128   I took the paper back to my place,
129   sat on the couch
130   and began to read it
131   fascinated, finally, with what the
132   other people
133   were doing.

        Bukowski, Charles :  girls from nowhere [from War All the Time:
        Poems, 1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the girls from nowhere came
2   and sat in my chairs and
3   drank and smoked with me
4   and got into my bed
5   like toy children
6   unreal


7   but
8   at times
9   there were
10   tiny bits of
11   marvelous magic


12   but most of
13   the time
14   they were
15   unattached
16   to everything


17   the sky
18   the ground
19   the sea
20   the voice
21   the laughter
22   or
23   the luck.


24   they were just
25   going on.


26   they had some
27   courage
28   but not much
29   kindness.


30   I always felt
31   better when
32   they left

[Page 241 ]


33   and was
34   unsure why
35   they
36   returned


37   always with
38   some story of
39   being abused
40   which was
41   probably
42   true.


43   but
44   they were
45   sometimes tiring
46   during the long
47   nights
48   with their
49   cursing and their
50   embittered
51   slurred
52   speeches
53   much hair
54   falling into
55   those faces.


56   the girls from
57   nowhere
58   had much
59   to say.


60   at times
61   I found this
62   (and them)
63   interesting
64   enough


65   explaining it

[Page 242 ]


66   all
67   with
68   verve


69   kicking
70   their
71   long legs with
72   spiked
73   heels


74   yet
75   they always brought
76   trouble
77   one way or the
78   other


79   especially if I
80   began to
81   care
82   too much.


83   then
84   they knew
85   what to
86   do


87   and they
88   did
89   it.


[Page 243 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  making it [from War All the Time: Poems,
        1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I was a frenetic wretch of a man
2   I was with R. and C. and M. and L. and
3   we were always fucking and there were arguments
4   there was unhappiness and my penis hurt
5   from constant ejaculation
6   I was sucking breasts
7   I was down between thighs
8   I was on top
9   I was on the bottom
10   I couldn't remember the last 7 times.


11   I'd get spasms just sitting in a chair
12   drinking a beer.
13   I sat on my reading glasses.
14   my veins were knotted in large bunches at my temples.
15   I got toothaches
16   backaches
17   headaches
18   I got flat tires everywhere
19   I got constipated
20   I didn't comb my hair
21   but I was fucking---
22   sometimes I'd be down there
23   and she'd be down there
24   "now when I do it," she'd say,
25   "you do it ..."


26   I was standing in bathrooms with wet
27   washrags
28   continually.
29   I couldn't clean the ring out of my toilet
30   but I was fucking and fighting
31   with R. and C. and M. and L.
32   they were always threatening to leave me
33   and I just couldn't understand them.


34   I wasn't good at war with women
35   I was too serious and they were

[Page 244 ]


36   too good at it.
37   they were smarter than I was
38   and I felt worse and worse.
39   the more I fucked them and fought
40   with them
41   the worse I felt.


42   I became totally inept:
43   I couldn't answer the doorbell or the
44   telephone,
45   I failed to make the bed
46   I couldn't shave
47   I couldn't brush my teeth
48   I got WARNING notices from the
49   phone company
50   from the water and power people
51   from the IRS
52   from Franchise Tax Board
53   I did send off for my license plate tab
54   but when it arrived
55   I promptly lost it ...


56   But I was fucking
57   I got some groans from
58   R. and C. and M. and L. that sounded
59   real
60   but I never did ask any of them if
61   they climaxed.
62   I sure as hell did.
63   continually.
64   the skin of my penis
65   was raw to the touch---like fire---
66   the m.d. said no v.d.
67   he said, "Christ, give that thing a
68   rest. take a year off. find some
69   other hobby."


70   but I continued.

[Page 245 ]




71   I laughed but without happiness.
72   I had ulcer attacks.
73   I aged five years in six months.
74   yet my jealousies
75   consumed me, my imagination whirled
76   counter-clockwise in my brain.
77   I drove my auto recklessly
78   I lost jobs, found jobs, lost jobs,
79   drank and smoked continually.
80   I had insomnia
81   the skin peeled off the
82   backs of my hands.
83   I had no appetite but I kept fucking and
84   I didn't know how to get out
85   of it.
86   I was caught there,
87   between legs lifted ceiling-
88   ward,
89   a man
90   doing it
91   again and again and again---
92   bedsheets, bedsteads, shades, curtains,
93   pillows, tits, breasts, buttocks.
94   the smell of love sometimes and the smell of sex
95   always
96   with R. and C. and M. and L. ...


97   but oftentimes
98   at the most intense and passionate
99   moments
100   I wished that I could be that
101   lonely fellow again
102   sitting in a movie house with
103   my bag of popcorn
104   as all about me
105   couples sat
106   side by side
107   together.

1   little to do on a HOT night but swat at
2   small BUGS and consider the
3   STOCKPILES


4   even SEX now brings the threat of DEATH
5   through new and incurable
6   DISEASES


7   now YOU must be prepared to
8   DIE for your
9   LOVE


10   and now
11   it seems
12   more and more
13   we are just sitting
14   WAITING for
15   NOTHING


16   now you must be
17   prepared to DIE
18   for
19   NOTHING


20   the jails and madhouses
21   are
22   FULL
23   yet there's no
24   PANIC


25   not even
26   here


27   I kill a flying
28   insect as the Tower of
29   Pisa
30   leans MORE and
31   MORE.

1   well,
2   now some eat to forget and some drink to forget and some
3   make love to forget
4   and some take drugs to forget and some go to movies to
5   forget
6   and some sleep to forget and some travel to forget and
7   some work crossword puzzles to forget and some
8   chop wood to forget and some
9   stand on their heads to forget
10   but what do they do to remember?
11   you can't tell me many things they do to remember
12   like I write this poem to remember to forget


13   some go to the circus to forget
14   and some fly gliders to forget
15   some mix salads
16   some pole vault
17   some shave their skulls
18   some walk through fire
19   as the water boils over
20   as the president laces his shoes
21   as the can can girls can can
22   there are whole oceans full of the tears of agony
23   and my father sits across the room from me now with
24   his big fat jowls of shimmering slime
25   knowing I'm typing about him now
26   knowing that I've failed to remember to forget
27   I switch on the radio
28   get Stravinsky
29   note the dirt under my
30   fingernails


31   he's
32   the best.

        Bukowski, Charles :  nice try [from War All the Time: Poems,

1   best dream I ever
2   had
3   I could
4   fly
5   in this
6   dream


7   I flew over
8   fields and the
9   dry brown
10   hills
11   and
12   below me
13   men, women and
14   children
15   were
16   running


17   and then
18   my flying
19   mechanism began to
20   fail
21   falter
22   and I began to
23   fall
24   slowly toward
25   them
26   and they
27   reached up their
28   hands
29   and tried to
30   grab me
31   but through sheer
32   and
33   damnable will
34   I forced myself to
35   fly
36   up

[Page 250 ]


37   again
38   out of their
39   reach


40   and with that
41   it got
42   easier and
43   easier
44   and I flew
45   up
46   up
47   through the clouds
48   and out into
49   the
50   sunlight.


51   when I awakened
52   I was on the
53   drunktank floor
54   of the old
55   Lincoln Heights jail
56   at North Avenue
57   21
58   and not only
59   didn't I have any
60   wings
61   all I had was
62   my property slip
63   and somebody was
64   puking
65   into the
66   toilet.


67   maybe I'd be
68   an angel
69   some other
70   time.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the puzzle [from War All the Time: Poems,
        1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   my neighbor is a nice guy but he utterly
2   confounds me:
3   he gets up very early in the morning, goes
4   to work;
5   his wife works, they have two lovely
6   children;
7   he is home in the evening, I sometimes see
8   the children, briefly see the
9   wife;
10   by 9 p.m. all the lights in their house are
11   out;
12   and his days repeat themselves like this;
13   he seems a fairly intelligent man
14   in his early 30's;
15   the only explanation for his
16   routine is that he must
17   enjoy his
18   work
19   believe in
20   God,
21   sex,
22   family.


23   I don't know why
24   but over there
25   I always expect some windows to break suddenly
26   I expect to hear some screams
27   hear obscene language
28   see lights at 3 a.m.
29   see
30   flying bottles


31   but for 5 years now
32   his routine has remained the
33   same


34   so
35   I take care of these other

[Page 252 ]


36   things for
37   him
38   which
39   I don't think his wife
40   appreciates:
41   "Hank, I could have
42   called the cops
43   many times but
44   I haven't."


45   sometimes
46   I'd like to call the
47   cops on /them/
48   but I don't think the cops
49   would understand my
50   complaint


51   their red lights flashing,
52   white-faced in
53   dark blue:


54   "Sir, there's no
55   /law/
56   against what they
57   are
58   doing ..."

        Bukowski, Charles :  Big John of Echo Park [from War All the
        Time: Poems, 1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   his wife worked and bought his
2   pills
3   and he sat in the big chair
4   six-feet-two and two-hundred-and
5   forty-five pounds
6   with
7   two thousand pounds of useless
8   junk spread
9   about the house.
10   he gathered and added to
11   this crap
12   almost every night
13   when he was
14   high.
15   scavenging the backyards and
16   garbage cans of the
17   neighborhood


18   and I
19   sat with him often
20   and we took pills
21   in mid-afternoon as
22   the world cranked
23   away.


24   he
25   was really a brilliant
26   fellow:
27   one day I
28   helped him carry out
29   2 weeks of dirty
30   dishes
31   and we spread them
32   about
33   in the yard
34   and he washed them down with
35   the garden
36   hose.

[Page 254 ]




37   we took the
38   pills and
39   we talked for
40   hours
41   days
42   and he recorded it
43   all on tape, most of
44   it useless
45   gibberish, most of
46   it
47   mine.


48   I saw him
49   the other day
50   and he looked as fine
51   as ever,
52   hadn't worked in
53   30 years
54   not even
55   at his writing:
56   the same
57   22 pages of very
58   strong
59   maybe great
60   writing
61   re-appearing
62   in the magazines
63   and given
64   from memory
65   at his
66   readings.


67   he knows that
68   ambition is
69   bullshit
70   shuck
71   and he can
72   point to

[Page 255 ]


73   the fact
74   that
75   over the
76   decades
77   it has
78   destroyed
79   all those
80   we once
81   knew.


82   "you still with
83   Sally?" I asked, about
84   his wife.


85   "shit," he
86   answered, "do you
87   think I'd /ever/ let
88   a good thing like
89   /that/
90   get away?"


91   he always had this
92   way of
93   easily mastering
94   any
95   conversation.


96   it's a
97   good thing
98   for many of us
99   in this stinking
100   racket
101   that he just
102   doesn't like to
103   type
104   too much.

        Bukowski, Charles :  on being recognized [from War All the Time:
        Poems, 1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the young girl found me at the track,
2   told me how much she liked my poems, stories,
3   novels.


4   when such moments occur
5   (and they do, at times)
6   I find it difficult to respond
7   because one does not walk about thinking,
8   I am a writer.
9   in fact, when you're not writing
10   you're not a writer.
11   one forgets.
12   and so,
13   one is never quite ready when
14   reminded.


15   so there she was, "glad you like my stuff,"
16   I responded without any originality, then
17   I became worldly and added, "when you see
18   my books be sure to buy them ..."


19   "oh sure, sure," she said
20   her beautiful eyes very close, her body
21   very close.


22   "I gotta bet now," I told
23   her.


24   "yes, of course," she
25   answered.


26   I walked off thinking about how possibly
27   thousands of young girls might be reading my books
28   in their beds.


29   then as I walked along
30   I happened to look down
31   I had been in a hurry to make the first

[Page 257 ]


32   race: I had on one black shoe and one
33   brown shoe.


34   original at last, I thought, hope it lasts
35   until the next time I see a
36   typewriter.


37   I made my bet and then went downstairs where
38   the young girl wouldn't see
39   the black shoe and the brown shoe
40   on the famous
41   writer.

        Bukowski, Charles :  love [from War All the Time: Poems,

1   answering a letter to somebody in Alaska
2   the radio has been tuned in to a new wave
3   group and I have listened to their work
4   and found that the favorite word in
5   all their songs is
6   "love."


7   the person in Alaska is young but dying,
8   considering suicide, and he wants to know
9   what I think
10   about it all, he wants an answer, he needs
11   one
12   and it's a difficult letter to write
13   as the young boy on the radio sings
14   "walk out on me now, baby, and I'm
15   done ..."


16   I change the station, get some classical
17   music, then my phone rings, it rings and
18   it rings
19   on a hot July night


20   nothing ever goes as it should, it
21   goes as it must, and I move toward the
22   telephone
23   even as warheads are
24   constantly shuttled
25   underground
26   on hidden railroad tracks
27   so that
28   enemy missiles cannot
29   locate them


30   I pick up the phone, say "hello,"
31   and
32   wait.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the hustle [from War All the Time: Poems,
        1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the readings in those college towns were hell,
2   of course, but I liked the flying in and out,
3   drinking on the planes, and I liked the hotels,
4   the impersonal rooms.


5   the nights before the readings were best,
6   stretched out on the bed in a strange town,
7   the fifth of whiskey on the night stand,
8   and, you know, those hotels were /quiet/ ...
9   those southern hotels
10   and especially those midwestern hotels.


11   it was a stupid hustle but it beat the factories,
12   I knew that, but it was humorous to me
13   and ridiculous that
14   I was accepted as a POET
15   but after I examined the work of my compatriots
16   I no longer minded taking the money
17   and after hearing some of them read
18   I hardly felt the impostor at all
19   although I knew I was a bit crazy
20   especially after drinking
21   and that
22   I just might
23   some night
24   take out my hose and start pissing from the
25   podium ...


26   some of the profs must have guessed
27   for after I accepted an invitation to read
28   most wrote back to me:
29   "I hope you won't cost me my job ..."


30   second best, I remember
31   the adoring eyes of the coeds
32   but first of all, like I said, I liked
33   all those hotel rooms the nights before the
34   readings

[Page 260 ]




35   me sitting up in bed, smoking, sucking
36   on the fifth, sick of looking at the poems,
37   thinking, if I can fool them it's all right,
38   worse have, many more will ...
39   no wonder this world isn't very
40   much


41   then I'd go for a big gulp from the fifth,
42   say, at 2:30 a.m.---
43   it was just like being back
44   home.

1   in my dreams
2   I can hit a home run almost
3   every time up
4   if I want
5   to.
6   I /could/ bat
7   .980


8   but soon they'd
9   just walk me
10   every time
11   I got to the
12   plate.


13   so,
14   that's what
15   I tell my

17   I've got to
18   strike out
19   now and then
20   just to make it
21   interesting ...


22   don't over-do
23   it, they
24   say.


25   I've got to keep
26   a low profile,
27   I tell them,
28   or I'll get eaten
29   up.


30   that's when the
31   screaming starts


32   you know, the way

[Page 262 ]


33   they talk you'd
34   think I wasn't
35   trying

37   all.

        Bukowski, Charles :  funny [from War All the Time: Poems,
        1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   sometimes you are liked for all the wrong
2   reasons
3   or hated for all the wrong reasons
4   or given credit where there is
5   none.
6   I once lived with a woman who
7   said that I was the funniest man
8   she had ever met
9   and she often laughed
10   when I said something serious.
11   "oh," she'd laugh, "you ought to be
12   in the entertainment
13   business!"
14   but when I /tried/ to be funny
15   she'd say,
16   "what the hell do you mean by
17   that? you're not
18   funny."


19   I finally figured it out:
20   the truth is the funniest thing
21   around
22   because you seldom ever hear
23   it
24   and when you do
25   it astonishes you into
26   laughter.
27   and when you try to be funny
28   you often exaggerate the truth
29   and that's not funny
30   at all ...


31   well, this woman and I
32   finally separated
33   and the next one never said whether
34   I was funny or
35   not,
36   she just switched on the

[Page 264 ]


37   tv
38   and laughed right along with
39   the laugh track
40   while I sat
41   demeaned and
42   depressed.

        Bukowski, Charles :  out of the blue [from War All the Time:

1   she phoned me from a far away
2   state
3   "I could never argue with you,"
4   she told me,
5   "you'd just run out the door.
6   my husband's not like that,
7   he sticks like glue.
8   he beats me."


9   "I never believed in discussions,"
10   I said, "there's nothing to
11   discuss."


12   "you're wrong," she said, "you should
13   try to communicate."


14   "'communicate' is an overused word like
15   'love'," I told her.


16   "but don't you think two people can
17   'love'?" she asked.


18   "not if they try to 'communicate',"
19   I answered.


20   "you're talking like an asshole,"
21   she said.


22   "we're having an argument,"
23   I said.


24   "no," she said, "we're trying to
25   communicate."


26   "I've got to leave," I said and hung
27   up, then took the phone off the
28   hook.

[Page 266 ]




29   I looked at the phone.
30   what they didn't understand was that
31   sometimes there was nothing to
32   save
33   except personal vindication of a
34   personal viewpoint
35   and that that was what was going to cause
36   that blinding white flash
37   one of these days.

        Bukowski, Charles :  sweater [from War All the Time: Poems,
        1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I had to drive to Palos Verdes to do some business at the
2   savings and loan,
3   there wasn't much of a line
4   which was good because there were only two tellers
5   young ladies
6   and I got one of them
7   but she couldn't seem to work
8   the computer.
9   sometimes the computer was down.
10   I waited and watched her struggle.
11   8 minutes went by.
12   my lady came back to the window and told me
13   that the computer wouldn't do something for
14   her.
15   "I'm new here," she told
16   me,
17   then turning to the other girl
18   she asked,
19   "could you help me with this transaction?"
20   the other girl didn't answer.
21   my lady tried again: "Louise, would you
22   please help me with this
23   transaction?"
24   "I'll be right back," Louise answered and
25   closed her window.
26   she then walked to one of the
27   tables
28   where an older woman was talking to a young man
29   wearing glasses.
30   Louise stopped about four feet from the
31   young man
32   folded her arms and began
33   listening.
34   then the young man spoke.
35   he had on a yellow sweater
36   only he didn't have it on,
37   he had it thrown about his shoulders
38   and the two empty arms hung down over his

[Page 268 ]


39   chest.
40   they continued to converse as I
41   watched.
42   the young man did most of the
43   talking
44   and as he did so he swayed
45   back and forth
46   ever so slightly
47   and the arms of his sweater swung
48   back and forth
49   back and forth
50   and he continued to talk and
51   sway
52   as I watched the empty arms
53   of his sweater swing
54   back and forth.
55   back and forth.


56   I don't like people who wear
57   loose sweaters over their backs
58   with arms dangling
59   and these types usually wear
60   sunglasses pushed back
61   into their hair
62   and I could sense
63   that what he was talking about was
64   utterly drab
65   useless
66   and probably
67   untrue
68   and
69   he had the bland unworried face
70   of somebody
71   to whom nothing had happened
72   yet
73   and as I watched him sway and
74   talk
75   his sweater arms continuing to

[Page 269 ]


76   swing
77   Louise stood there
78   four feet away
79   arms folded
80   listening,
81   and I thought,
82   this fellow has less
83   sense
84   than the common housefly,
85   and this Louise ...
86   likewise.
87   she knew I was waiting.


88   I began walking toward
89   them,
90   I had to make the first post
91   at the racetrack
92   and these three were
93   being rude, dumb, as if it was a
94   natural order of business.


95   I had no idea what I was going to
96   say
97   but it was going to be
98   good.
99   they stopped talking as I
100   approached.
101   then I heard the voice
102   behind me:
103   "Mr. Chinaski!"
104   I stopped,
105   turned.
106   "I got the computer to
107   function!"


108   I wasn't too happy to
109   hear that.
110   I went back to the counter

[Page 270 ]


111   and we completed the
112   bookwork.
113   the girl apologized but
114   I told her it was
115   all right.


116   as I walked toward the
117   door
118   I needed to pass the
119   other three.
120   they were in the
121   same positions
122   and the young man was
123   still talking
124   but he no longer
125   swayed
126   and the arms of his
127   yellow sweater
128   no longer
129   swung
130   about.


131   we'd spoiled each others'
132   fucking
133   day.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the skaters [from War All the Time: Poems,
        1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I am sitting at a table in the mall drinking coffee while
2   Linda shops.
3   I sit above the ice rink where the children skate
4   in the afternoon,
5   mostly young girls dressed in blues, reds, whites, greens,
6   purples, yellows, orange
7   they are all very good, swift, they spin and glide,
8   there are no collisions. even the tiniest child
9   very good, all---
10   tiny, larger and largest---
11   whirl through the open spaces as if they were one.


12   I like it, very much, but then I think
13   as they get older they will stop skating, they will
14   stop singing, painting, dancing,
15   their interests will shift to
16   survival,
17   the grace and the gamble will disappear.
18   but let's not feel too bad:
19   this happens to animals too:
20   they play so long
21   then
22   stop ...


23   then I see Linda, it appears that she has
24   found something that
25   pleases her, she rushes toward my table, she
26   waves,
27   laughing.
28   I stand up, wave, smile,
29   things seem very happy
30   as down below us they whirl and
31   glide.
32   some moments are nice, some are
33   nicer, some are even worth
34   writing
35   about.

        Bukowski, Charles :  about pain [from War All the Time: Poems,
        1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   my first and only wife
2   painted
3   and she talked to me
4   about it:
5   "it's all so /painful/
6   for me, each stroke is
7   /pain/ ...
8   one mistake and
9   the whole painting is
10   /ruined/ ...
11   you will /never/ under-
12   stand the
13   /pain/ ..."


14   "look, baby," I
15   said, "why doncha do something easy---
16   something ya like ta
17   do?"


18   she just looked at me
19   and I think it was her
20   first understanding of
21   the tragedy of our being
22   together.


23   such things usually
24   begin
25   somewhere.

        Bukowski, Charles :  pace is the essence [from War All the Time:

1   as the mailman walked up the hill
2   he laughed
3   when he saw me.
4   I laughed too.
5   "yeah, Harry, I know:
6   just an old man with a hose
7   watering the parkway.
8   you got me ..."


9   those guys think it's got to be
10   war
11   all the time.
12   I'm just taking a
13   rest.
14   when I finally press that red
15   button
16   they'll wish I was
17   back watering the
18   gladiolas.

        Bukowski, Charles :  green [from War All the Time: Poems,
        1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I've been drunk in front of cracked bathroom mirrors
2   in Southern towns of nowhere
3   holding a paring knife near the jugular vein and
4   grinning.
5   that's when I first learned that stage play is
6   a great substitute for
7   reality:
8   the only separation between doing and
9   pretending to do
10   being that infinite hairline of
11   choice: a
12   choice between nothing and
13   nothing.


14   to awaken in the morning, to
15   find a place of
16   employment
17   where the workers accepted everything
18   but the dream of
19   escape.
20   there were so many places like
21   that.
22   there was a job in this town
23   in Louisiana
24   which I left each evening
25   tired and dulled
26   to that night again
27   pouring glassfuls and
28   looking out the
29   window and
30   thinking about a girl at
31   work
32   in an ill-fitting green dress
33   who cursed continually about
34   almost everything.
35   I only wanted to fuck her
36   once and
37   get out of

[Page 275 ]


38   town.
39   I only got out of town,
40   which means I made a choice between
41   staying nowhere and going
42   nowhere,
43   and I imagine if she's alive she's
44   still cursing about
45   something
46   but I no longer hold the paring knife
47   near the jugular vein---
48   the end is getting
49   close enough
50   all by
51   itself.

        Bukowski, Charles :  one for the old boy [from War All the Time:
        Poems, 1981-1984 (1984) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   he was just a
2   cat
3   cross-eyed,
4   a dirty white
5   with pale blue eyes


6   I won't bore you with his
7   history
8   just to say
9   he had much bad luck
10   and was a good old
11   guy
12   and he died
13   like people die
14   like elephants die
15   like rats die
16   like flowers die
17   like water evaporates and
18   the wind stops blowing


19   the lungs gave out
20   last Monday.
21   now he's in the rose
22   garden
23   and I've heard a
24   stirring march
25   playing for him
26   inside of me
27   which I know
28   not many
29   but some of you
30   would like to
31   know
32   about.


33   that's
34   all.

        Bukowski, Charles :  eating my senior citizen's dinner at the
        Sizzler [from War All the Time: Poems, 1981-1984 (1984) , Black
        Sparrow Press ]



1   between 2 and 5 p.m. any day and any time on Sunday and
2   Wednesday, it's 20% off for
3   us old dogs approaching the sunset.
4   it's strange to be old and not feel
5   old
6   but I glance in the mirror
7   see some silver hair
8   concede that I'd look misplaced at a
9   rock concert.


10   I eat alone.
11   the other oldies are in groups,
12   a man and a woman
13   a woman and a woman
14   three old women
15   another man and a
16   woman.
17   it's 4:30 p.m. on a
18   Tuesday
19   and just 5 or 6 blocks north is
20   the cemetery
21   on a long sloping green hill,
22   a very modern place with
23   the markers
24   flat on the ground,
25   it's much more pleasant for
26   passing traffic.


27   a young waitress
28   moves among us
29   filling our cups
30   again with lovely
31   poisonous caffeine.
32   we thank her and
33   chew on,
34   some with our own
35   teeth.

[Page 278 ]


36   we wouldn't lose much in a
37   nuclear explosion.


38   one good old boy talks
39   on and on
40   about what
41   he's not too
42   sure.


43   well, I finish my meal,
44   leave a tip.
45   I have the last table by the
46   exit door.
47   as I'm about to leave
48   I'm blocked by an old girl
49   in a walker
50   followed by another old girl
51   whose back is bent
52   like a bow.
53   their faces, their arms
54   their hands are like
55   parchment
56   as if they had already been
57   embalmed
58   but they leave quietly.


59   as I made ready to leave
60   again
61   I am blocked
62   this time by a huge
63   wheelchair
64   the back tilted low
65   it's almost like a bed,
66   a very expensive
67   mechanism,
68   an awesome and glorious
69   receptacle
70   the chrome glitters

[Page 279 ]


71   and the thick tires are
72   air-inflated
73   and the lady in the chair and
74   the lady pushing it
75   look alike,
76   sisters no doubt,
77   one's lucky
78   gets to ride,
79   and they go by
80   again very /white/ .


81   and then
82   I rise
83   make it to the door
84   into stunning sunlight
85   make it to the car
86   get in
87   roar the engine into
88   life
89   rip it into reverse
90   with a quick back turn of squealing
91   tires
92   I slam to a bouncing halt
93   rip the wheel right
94   feed the gas
95   go from first to second
96   spin into a gap of
97   traffic
98   am quickly into
99   3rd
100   4th
101   I am up to
102   50 mph in a flash
103   moving through
104   them.
105   who can turn the stream
106   of destiny?
107   I light a cigarette

[Page 280 ]


108   punch on the radio
109   and a young girl
110   sings,
111   "put it where it hurts,
112   daddy, make me love
113   you ..."

        Preface

The poems in the first three sections of this book were originally
published in three volumes now long out of print: /It Catches My Heart
in Its Hands/ (Loujon Press, 1963), /Crucifix in a Deathhand/ (Loujon
Press in collaboration with Lyle Stuart, Inc., 1965), and /At Terror
Street and Agony Way/ (Black Sparrow Press, 1968). The author would like
to give acknowledgement to the publishers of these volumes, Jon and
Louise Webb, Lyle Stuart, and John Martin.

The author would like to thank the National Endowment for the Arts for a
grant on which the poems in the final section of this book were written.

        AUTHOR'S INTRODUCTION

The poems in the first three sections of this book are from the years
1955-1968 and the poems in the last section are the new work of
1972-1973. The reader might wonder what happened to the years 1969-1971,
since the author once did vanish (literally) from 1944 to 1954. But not
this time. /The Days Run Away Like Wild Horses Over The Hills/ (Black
Sparrow Press, 1969) contains the poems from late 1968 and most of 1969,
plus selections from five early chapbooks not covered by the first three
sections of this book. /Mockingbird Wish Me Luck/ (Black Sparrow Press,
1972) prints poems written from late 1969 to early 1972. So, for my
critics, readers, friends, enemies, ex-lovers and new lovers, the
present volume along with /Days/ and /Mockingbird/ contain what I like
to consider my best work written over the past nineteen years.

Each of these sections brings back special memories. For /It Catches My
Heart In Its Hands/ I was required to make a trip to New Orleans. The
editor first had to check me out to see if I was a decent human being.
Catching the train at the Union Station just below the Terminal Annex of
the Post Office where I worked for Uncle Sam, I sat in the bar car and
drank scotch and water and sped toward New Orleans to be judged and
measured by an ex-con who owned an ancient printing press. Jon Webb
believed that most writers (and he'd met some good ones including
Sherwood Anderson, Faulkner, Hemingway) were detestable human beings
when they were away from their typewriters. I arrived, they met me, Jon
and his wife, Louise, we drank and talked for two weeks, then Jon Webb
said, "You're a bastard, Bukowski, but I'm going to publish you anyhow."
I left town. But that wasn't all. Soon they were both in Los Angeles
with their two dogs in a green hotel just off skid row. Re-check. Drink
and talk. I was still a bastard. Goodbye. Much leaving and waving
through train windows. Louise cried through the glass. /It Catches/ was
published ...

The bulk of the poems in /Crucifix In A Deathhand/ were written during
one very hot, lyrical month in New Orleans in the year 1965. I'd walk
down the street and I'd stagger, sober I'd stagger, hear

[Page ]

churchbells, wounded dogs, wounded me, all that. I had gone into a slump
or a blackout after the publication of /It Catches,/ and Jon and Louise
had brought me back down to New Orleans. I lived right around the corner
from them with a fat, kind woman whose ex-husband (who'd died) had come
very close to being welterweight or middleweight champion of the world,
I forget which. Each night I went over to Jon and Louise's and we drank
until early morning at a small table in the kitchen with the roaches
running up and down the wall in front of us (they particularly liked to
circle around an unshaded lightbulb sticking out of the wall) as we
drank and talked.

I would go back to my place and awaken about 10:30 a.m., quite sick. I'd
dress and walk over to Jon's place. The press was below street level and
I'd peek down at him before I knocked. I could see him through the
window, calm, cool, hardly hungover at all, humming, and feeding pages
of /Crucifix/ into the press.

"Got any poems, Bukowski?" he'd ask as I walked in. (One had to be
careful: feeding poems into a waiting press can easily dissolve into
journalism.)

Jon would become downright unlaced if I didn't have a handful of poems.
It wasn't as pleasant to be around that bastard then, and I'd find
myself back in my room beating the typer. In the evening, if I brought
him a little sheaf of poems, his mood would be better.

So I kept writing poems. We drank with the roaches, the place was small,
and pages 5, 6, 7 and 8 were stacked in the bathtub, nobody could bathe,
and pages 1, 2, 3 and 4 were in a large trunk, and soon there wasn't
anyplace to put anything. There were 7-and-one-half foot stacks of pages
everywhere. Very carefully we moved between them. The bathtub had been
useful but the bed was in the way. So Jon built a little loft out of
discarded lumber. Plus a stairway. And Jon and Louise slept up there on
a mattress and the bed was given away. There was more floor space to
stack the pages. "Bukowski, Bukowski everywhere! I am going crazy!" said
Louise. The roaches circled and we drank and the press gulped my poems.
A very strange time, and that was /Crucifix/ ...



[Page ]

I used to go to John Thomas' place and stay all night. We'd take pills
and drink and talk. That is, John took the pills and I took the pills
/and/ drank, and we both talked. John was then in the habit of taping
everything, whether it was good or bad, dull or interesting, worthless
or useful. We would listen to our conversations the next day, and it
/was/ a worthwhile process, at least for me. I realized how oafish and
overbearing and off-target I often was, at least when I was high. And
sometimes when I wasn't.

At one time during these tapings John asked that I bring over some poems
and read them. I did. And left the poems there and forgot about them.
The poems were thrown out with the garbage. Months passed. One day
Thomas phoned me. "Those poems, Bukowski, would make a good book." "What
poems, John?" He said he had taken out the tape of my poems and had
listened to it again. "I'd have to type them off the tape, it's just too
much work," I said. "I'll type them up for you." I agreed, and soon I
had the poems back in typescript form.

At this time a balding red-haired man with a high, scrubbed forehead,
meticulous and kind, with a very faint, perpetual grin was coming by. He
worked as the manager of an office furniture and supply company and was
a collector of rare books. His name was John Martin. He had published
some of my poems as broadsides. He wrote me out checks as I sat in my
kitchen across from him, drinking beer and signing the broadsides. It
was the beginning of the Black Sparrow Press, a house that was soon to
begin publishing a large portion of America's avant-garde poetry, but
neither of us knew it then.

I showed John Martin the poems Thomas had typed off the tape for me. I
had checked his transcriptions, and he'd done a careful, accurate job.
John Martin took the poems home with him and phoned me a couple of days
later: "You have a book there and I'm going to publish it myself." And
that's how some almost lost poems were found again and printed in book
form and the Black Sparrow was flying. I called the book /At Terror
Street And Agony Way/ .



[Page ]

Looking at these poems written between 1955 and 1973 I like (for one
reason or another) the last poems best. I am pleased with this. I have,
of course, no idea what shape my future poems will take, or even if I
will write any, because I have no idea how long I will go on living, but
since I began writing poetry quite late in life, at the age of 35, I
like to think they'll give me a few extra years now, at this end.
Meanwhile, the poems that follow will have to do.

Charles Bukowski January 30, 1974

        Water Drowning in Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black
        Sparrow Press ]


1   I awakened to dryness and the ferns were dead,
2   the potted plants yellow as corn;
3   my woman was gone
4   and the empty bottles like bled corpses
5   surrounded me with their uselessness;
6   the sun was still good, though,
7   and my landlady's note cracked in fine and
8   undemanding yellowness; what was needed now
9   was a good comedian, ancient style, a jester
10   with jokes upon absurd pain; pain is absurd
11   because it exists, nothing more;
12   I shaved carefully with an old razor
13   the man who had once been young and
14   said to have genius; but
15   that's the tragedy of the leaves,
16   the dead ferns, the dead plants;
17   and I walked into a dark hall
18   where the landlady stood
19   execrating and final,
20   sending me to hell,
21   waving her fat, sweaty arms
22   and screaming
23   screaming for rent
24   because the world had failed us
25   both.

        Bukowski, Charles :  to the whore who took my poems [from

        (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   some say we should keep personal remorse from the
2   poem,
3   stay abstract, and there is some reason in this,
4   but jezus;
5   twelve poems gone and I don't keep carbons and you have
6   my
7   paintings too, my best ones; it's stifling:
8   are you trying to crush me out like the rest of them?
9   why didn't you take my money? they usually do
10   from the sleeping drunken pants sick in the corner.
11   next time take my left arm or a fifty
12   but not my poems:
13   I'm not Shakespeare
14   but sometime simply
15   there won't be any more, abstract or otherwise;
16   there'll always be money and whores and drunkards
17   down to the last bomb,
18   but as God said,
19   crossing his legs,
20   I see where I have made plenty of poets
21   but not so very much
22   poetry.

        window [from Burning in Water Drowning in Flame: Selected Poems
        1955-1973 (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   I am watching a girl dressed in a
2   light green sweater, blue shorts, long black stockings;
3   there is a necklace of some sort
4   but her breasts are small, poor thing,
5   and she watches her nails
6   as her dirty white dog sniffs the grass
7   in erratic circles;
8   a pigeon is there too, circling,
9   half dead with a tick of a brain
10   and I am upstairs in my underwear,
11   3 day beard, pouring a beer and waiting
12   for something literary or symphonic to happen;
13   but they keep, circling, circling, and a thin old man
14   in his last winter rolls by pushed by a girl
15   in a catholic school dress;
16   somewhere there are the Alps, and ships
17   are now crossing the sea;
18   there are piles and piles of H- and A-bombs,
19   enough to blow up fifty worlds and Mars thrown in,
20   but they keep circling,
21   the girl shifts buttocks,
22   and the Hollywood Hills stand there, stand there
23   full of drunks and insane people and
24   much kissing in automobiles,
25   but it's no good: /che sera, sera:/
26   her dirty white dog simply will not shit,
27   and with a last look at her nails
28   she, with much whirling of buttocks
29   walks to her downstairs court
30   trailed by her constipated dog (simply not worried),
31   leaving me looking at a most unsymphonic pigeon.
32   well, from the looks of things, relax:
33   the bombs will never go off.

1   slipping keenly into bright ashes,
2   target of vanilla tears
3   your sure body lit candles for men
4   on dark nights,
5   and now your night is darker
6   than the candle's reach
7   and we will forget you, somewhat,
8   and it is not kind
9   but real bodies are nearer
10   and as the worms pant for your bones,
11   I would so like to tell you
12   that this happens to bears and elephants
13   to tyrants and heroes and ants
14   and frogs,
15   still, you brought us something,
16   some type of small victory,
17   and for this I say: good
18   and let us grieve no more;
19   like a flower dried and thrown away,
20   we forget, we remember,
21   we wait. child, child, child,
22   I raise my drink a full minute
23   and smile.

        Drowning in Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black
        Sparrow Press ]


1   the next time you listen to Borodin
2   remember he was just a chemist
3   who wrote music to relax;
4   his house was jammed with people:
5   students, artists, drunkards, bums,
6   and he never knew how to say: no.
7   the next time you listen to Borodin
8   remember his wife used his compositions
9   to line the cat boxes with
10   or to cover jars of sour milk;
11   she had asthma and insomnia
12   and fed him soft-boiled eggs
13   and when he wanted to cover his head
14   to shut out the sounds of the house
15   she only allowed him to use the sheet;
16   besides there was usually somebody
17   in his bed
18   (they slept separately when they slept
19   at all)
20   and since all the chairs
21   were usually taken
22   he often slept on the stairway
23   wrapped in an old shawl;
24   she told him when to cut his nails,
25   not to sing or whistle
26   or put too much lemon in his tea
27   or press it with a spoon;
28   /Symphony #2, in B Minor/
29   /Prince Igor/
30   /On the Steppes of Central Asia/
31   he could sleep only by putting a piece
32   of dark cloth over his eyes;
33   in 1887 he attended a dance
34   at the Medical Academy
35   dressed in a merrymaking national costume;
36   at last he seemed exceptionally gay
37   and when he fell to the floor,
38   they thought he was clowning.
39   the next time you listen to Borodin,
40   remember ...

2   with dyed red hair
3   kept leaning her breasts against me

7   her face
8   and told her about a Van Gogh
9   exhibition

11   and that night

        Drowning in Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black
        Sparrow Press ]


1   I met her somehow through correspondence or poetry or magazines
2   and she began sending me very sexy poems about rape and lust,
3   and this being mixed in with a minor intellectualism
4   confused me somewhat and I got in my car and drove North
5   through the mountains and valleys and freeways
6   without sleep, coming off a drunk, just divorced,
7   jobless, aging, tired, wanting mostly to sleep
8   for five or ten years, I finally found the motel
9   in a small sunny town by a dirt road,
10   and I sat there smoking a cigarette
11   thinking, you must really be insane,
12   and then I got out an hour late
13   to meet my date; she was pretty damned old,
14   almost as old as I, not very sexy
15   and she gave me a very hard raw apple
16   which I chewed on with my remaining teeth;
17   she was dying of some unnamed disease
18   something like asthma, and she said,
19   I want to tell you a secret, and I said,
20   I know: you are a virgin, 35 years old.
21   and she got out a notebook, ten or twelve poems:
22   a life's work and I had to read them
23   and I tried to be kind
24   but they were very bad.
25   and I took her somewhere, the boxing matches,
26   and she coughed in the smoke
27   and kept looking around and around
28   at all the people
29   and then at the fighters
30   clenching her hands.
31   you never get excited, do you? she asked.
32   but I got pretty excited in the hills that night,
33   and met her three or four more times
34   helped her with some of her poems
35   and she rammed her tongue halfway down my throat
36   but when I left her
37   she was still a virgin
38   and a very bad poetess.
39   I think that when a woman has kept her legs closed

[Page 22 ]


40   for 35 years
41   it's too late
42   either for love
43   or for
44   poetry.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the twins [from Burning in Water Drowning
        in Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   he hinted at times that I was a bastard and I told him to listen
2   to Brahms, and I told him to learn to paint and drink and not be
3   dominated by women and dollars
4   but he screamed at me, For Christ's Sake remember your mother,
5   remember your country,
6   you'll kill us all! ...



7   I move through my father's house (on which he owed $8,000 after 20
8   years on the same job) and look at his dead shoes
9   the way his feet curled the leather, as if he was angrily planting
roses,
10   and he was, and I look at his dead cigarette, his last cigarette
11   and the last bed he slept in that night, and I feel I should remake it
12   but I can't, for a father is always your master even when he's gone;
13   I guess these things have happened time and again but I can't help
14   thinking


15   to die on a kitchen floor at 7 o'clock in the morning
16   while other people are frying eggs
17   is not so rough
18   unless it happens to you.



19   I go outside and pick an orange and peel back the bright skin;
20   things are still living: the grass is growing quite well,
21   the sun sends down its rays circled by a Russian satellite,
22   a dog barks senselessly somewhere, the neighbors peek behind blinds.
23   I am a stranger here, and have been (I suppose) somewhat the rogue,
24   and I have no doubt he painted me quite well (the old boy and I
25   fought like mountain lions) and they say he left it all to some woman
26   in Duarte but I don't give a damn---she can have it: he was my old
27   man


28   and he died.



29   inside, I try on a light blue suit
30   much better than anything I have ever worn
31   and I flap the arms like a scarecrow in the wind
32   but it's no good:

[Page 24 ]


33   I can't keep him alive
34   no matter how much we hated each other.



35   we looked exactly alike, we could have been twins
36   the old man and I: that's what they
37   said. he had his bulbs on the screen
38   ready for planting
39   while I was lying with a whore from 3rd street.



40   very well. grant us this moment: standing before a mirror
41   in my dead father's suit
42   waiting also
43   to die.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the day it rained at the los angeles county
        museum [from Burning in Water Drowning in Flame: Selected Poems
        1955-1973 (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the jew bent over and
2   died. 99 machine guns
3   were shipped to France. somebody won the 3rd race
4   while I inspected
5   the propeller of an old monoplane
6   a man came by with a patch over his eye. it began to
7   rain. it rained and it rained and the ambulances ran
8   together
9   in the streets, and although
10   everything was properly dull
11   I enjoyed the moment
12   like the time in New Orleans
13   living on candy bars
14   and watching the pigeons
15   in a back alley with a French name
16   as behind me the river became
17   a gulf
18   and the clouds moved sickly through
19   a sky that had died
20   about the time Caesar was knifed,
21   and I promised myself then
22   that someday I'd remember it
23   as it was.



24   a man came by and coughed.
25   think it'll stop raining? he said.
26   I didn't answer. I touched the
27   old propeller and listened to the
28   ants on the roof rushing over
29   the edge of the world. go away, I said,
30   go away or I'll call
31   the guard.

1   nothing matters
2   but flopping on a mattress
3   with cheap dreams and a beer
4   as the leaves die and the horses die
5   and the landladies stare in the halls;
6   brisk the music of pulled shades,
7   a last man's cave
8   in an eternity of swarm
9   and explosion;
10   nothing but the dripping sink,
11   the empty bottle,
12   euphoria,
13   youth fenced in,
14   stabbed and shaven,
15   taught words
16   propped up
17   to die.

1   hooray say the roses, today is blamesday
2   and we are red as blood.


3   hooray say the roses, today is Wednesday
4   and we bloom where soldiers fell,
5   and lovers too,
6   and the snake ate the word.


7   hooray say the roses, darkness comes
8   all at once, like lights gone out,
9   the sun leaves dark continents
10   and rows of stone.


11   hooray say the roses, cannons and spires,
12   birds, bees, bombers, today is Friday
13   the hand holding a medal out the window,
14   a moth going by, half a mile an hour,
15   hooray hooray
16   hooray say the roses
17   we wave empires on our stems,
18   the sun moves the mouth:
19   hooray hooray hooray
20   and that is why you like us.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the sunday artist [from Burning in Water
        Drowning in Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black
        Sparrow Press ]


1   I have been painting these last two Sundays;
2   it's not much, you're correct,
3   but in this tournament great dreams break:
4   history removes her dress and becomes a harlot,
5   and I have awakened in the morning
6   to see eagles flapping their wings like shades;
7   I have met Montaigne and Phidias
8   in the flames of my wastebasket,
9   I have met barbarians on the streets
10   their heads rocking with rodents;
11   I have seen wicked infants in blue tubs
12   wanting stems as beautiful as flowers,
13   and I have seen the barfly sick
14   over his last dead penny;
15   I have heard Domenico Theotocopoulos
16   on nights of frost, cough in his grave;
17   and God, no taller than a landlady,
18   hair dyed red, has asked me the time;
19   I have seen grey grass of lovers in my mirror
20   while lighting a cigarette to a maniac's applause;
21   Cadillacs have crawled my walls like roaches,
22   goldfish whirl my bowl, hand-tamed tigers;
23   yes, I have been painting these Sundays---
24   the grey mill, the new rebel; it's terrible really:
25   I must ram my fist through cleanser and chlorine,
26   through Andernach and apples and acid,
27   but, then, I really should tell you that I have a
28   woman around mixing waffle flour and singing,
29   and the paint sticks to my plan like candy.

        Bukowski, Charles :  old poet [from Burning in Water Drowning in
        Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I would, of course, prefer to be with the fox in the ferns
2   instead of with a photograph of an old Spad in my pocket
3   to the sound of the anvil chorus and legs legs legs
4   girls kicking high, showing everything but the pisser,
5   but I might as well be dead right now


6   everywhere the ill wind blows
7   and Keats is dead
8   and I am dying too.


9   for there is nothing as crappy dissolute
10   as an old poet gone sour
11   in body and mind
12   and luck, the horses running nothing but out,
13   the Vegas dice cancer to the thin green wallet,
14   Shostakovich heard too often
15   and cans of beer sucked through a straw,
16   with mouth and mind broken in
17   young men's alleys.
18   in the hot noon window
19   I swing and miss a razzing fly,
20   and ho, I fall heavy as thunder
21   but downstairs they'll understand:
22   he's either drunk or dying,
23   an old poet nodding vaguely in halls,
24   cracking his stick across the backs
25   of innocent dogs
26   and spitting out
27   what's left of his sun.
28   the mailman has some little thing for him
29   which he takes to his room
30   and opens like a rose,
31   only to scream loudly and vainly,
32   and his coffin is filled
33   with notes from hell.
34   but in the morning you'll see him
35   packing off little envelopes,
36   still worried about
37   rent
38   cigarettes
39   wine

[Page 30 ]




40   women
41   horses,
42   still worried about
43   Eric Coates, Beethoven's 3rd and
44   something Chicago has held for three months
45   and his paper bag of wine
46   and Pall Malls.
47   42 in August, 42,
48   the rats walking his brain
49   eating up the thoughts before they
50   can make the keys.
51   old poets are as bad as old queers:
52   there's something quite unacceptable:
53   the editors wish to thank you for
54   submitting but
55   regret ...
56   down
57   down
58   down
59   the dark hall
60   into a womanless hall
61   to peel a last egg
62   and sit down to the keys:
63   click click a click,
64   over the television sounds
65   over the sounds of springs,
66   click clack a clack:
67   another old poet
68   going off.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the race [from Burning in Water Drowning in
        Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   it is like this
2   when you slip down,
3   done like a wound-up victrola
4   (you remember those?)
5   and you go downtown
6   and watch the boys punch
7   but the big blondes sit with
8   someone else
9   and you've aged like a punk in a movie:
10   cigar in skull, fat gut,
11   but only no money,
12   no wiseness of way, no worldliness,
13   but as usual
14   most of the fights are bad,
15   and afterwards
16   back in the parking lot
17   you sit and watch them go,
18   light the last cigar,
19   and then start the old car,
20   old car, not so young man
21   going down the street
22   stopped by a red light
23   as if time were no problem,
24   and they come up to you:
25   a car full of young,
26   laughing,
27   and you watch them go
28   until
29   somebody behind you honks
30   and you are shaken back
31   into what is left
32   of your life.
33   pitiful, self-pity,
34   and your foot is to the floor
35   and you catch the young ones,
36   you pass the young ones
37   and holding the wheel like all love gone
38   you race to the beach
39   with them
40   brandishing your cigar and your steel,
41   laughing,

[Page 32 ]


42   you will take them to the ocean
43   to the last mermaid,
44   seaweed and shark, merry whale,
45   end of flesh and hour and horror,
46   and finally they stop
47   and you go on
48   toward your ocean,
49   the cigar biting your lips
50   the way love used to.

        Bukowski, Charles :  vegas [from Burning in Water Drowning in
        Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   there was a frozen tree that I wanted to paint
2   but the shells came down
3   and in Vegas looking across at a green sunshade
4   at 3:30 in the morning,
5   I died without nails, without a copy of the /Atlantic Monthly/ ,
6   the windows screamed like doves moaning the bombing of Milan
7   and I went out to live with the rats
8   but the lights were too bright
9   and I thought maybe I'd better go back and sit in a
10   poetry class:


11   a marvelous description of a gazelle
12   is hell;
13   the cross sits like a fly on my window,
14   my mother's breath stirs small leaves
15   in my mind;


16   and I hitch-hiked back to L.A. through hangover clouds
17   and I pulled a letter from my pocket and read it
18   and the truckdriver said, what's that?
19   and I said, there's some gal up North who used to
20   sleep with Pound, she's trying to tell me that H.D.
21   was our greatest scribe; well, Hilda gave us a few pink
22   Grecian gods in with the chinaware, but after reading her
23   I still have 140 icicles hanging from my bones.



24   I'm not going all the way to L.A., the truckdriver said.



25   it's all right, I said, the calla lilies nod to our minds
26   and someday we'll all go home
27   together.



28   in fact, he said, this is as far
29   as we go.
30   so I let him have it; old withered whore of time
31   your breasts taste the sour cream of dreaming ...
32   he let me out
33   in the middle of the desert;

[Page 34 ]


34   to die is to die is to die,



35   old phonographs in cellars,
36   joe di maggio,
37   magazines in with the onions ...



38   an old Ford picked me up
39   45 minutes later
40   and, this time,
41   I kept my mouth
42   shut.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the house [from Burning in Water Drowning
        in Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   they are building a house
2   half a block down
3   and I sit up here
4   with the shades down
5   listening to the sounds,
6   the hammers pounding in nails,
7   thack thack thack thack,
8   and then I hear birds, and
9   thack thack thack
10   and I go to bed,
11   I pull the covers to my throat;
12   they have been building this house
13   for a month, and soon it will have
14   its people ... sleeping, eating,
15   loving, moving around,
16   but somehow
17   now
18   it is not right,
19   there seems a madness,
20   men walk on its top with nails in their mouths
21   and I read about Castro and Cuba,
22   and at night I walk by
23   and the ribs of house show
24   and inside I can see cats walking
25   the way cats walk,
26   and then a boy rides by on a bicycle,
27   and still the house is not done
28   and in the morning the men
29   will be back
30   walking around on the house
31   with their hammers,
32   and it seems people should not build houses
33   anymore,
34   it seems people should stop working
35   and sit in small rooms
36   on second floors
37   under electric lights without shades;
38   it seems there is a lot to forget
39   and a lot not to do
40   and in drugstores, markets, bars,
41   the people are tired, they do not want

[Page 36 ]


42   to move, and I stand there at night
43   and look through this house and the
44   house does not *want* to be built;
45   through its sides I can see the purple hills
46   and the first lights of evening,
47   and it is cold
48   and I button my coat
49   and I stand there looking through the house
50   and the cats stop and look at me
51   until I am embarrassed
52   and move North up the sidewalk
53   where I will buy
54   cigarettes and beer
55   and return to my room.

        Sparrow Press ]


1   the bulls are grand as the side of the sun
2   and although they kill them for the stale crowds,
3   it is the bull that burns the fire,
4   and although there are cowardly bulls as
5   there are cowardly matadors and cowardly men,
6   generally the bull stands pure
7   and dies pure
8   untouched by symbols or cliques or false loves,
9   and when they drag him out
10   nothing has died
11   something has passed
12   and the eventual stench
13   is the world.

1   the boy walks with his muddy feet across my
2   soul
3   talking about recitals, virtuosi, conductors,
4   the lesser known novels of Dostoevsky;
5   talking about how he corrected a waitress,
6   /a hasher/ who didn't know that French dressing
7   was composed of /so and so;/
8   he gabbles about the Arts until
9   I hate the Arts,
10   and there is nothing cleaner
11   than getting back to a bar or
12   back to the track and watching them run,
13   watching things go without this
14   clamor and chatter,
15   talk, talk, talk,
16   the small mouth going, the eyes blinking,
17   a boy, a child, sick with the Arts,
18   grabbing at it like the skirt of a mother,
19   and I wonder how many tens of thousands
20   there are like him across the land
21   on rainy nights
22   on sunny mornings
23   on evenings meant for peace
24   in concert halls
25   in cafes
26   at poetry recitals
27   talking, soiling, arguing.



28   it's like a pig going to bed
29   with a good woman
30   and you don't want
31   the woman any more.

        Black Sparrow Press ]


1   red summers and black satin
2   charcoal and blood
3   ringing the sheets
4   while snails are stepped on
5   and moths go batty
6   trying to put on the eyes
7   of lightbulbs in
8   artificial cities;
9   I light her a cigarette
10   and she blows up a plasma
11   of relaxation
12   to prove we've both been
13   good lovers---
14   white on black, and in black;
15   and her toes strike dark
16   intersections
17   in my beefy sheets
18   she says, that elevator boy ...
19   y'know him?
20   I say yes.
21   a bastard ... beats his wife.
22   I put my hand
23   flat to the surface
24   where the curve goes down.
25   damn for an OLD man,
26   you sure likes to play!
27   I reach over and pick up
28   the bottle, suck it down
29   flat on my back,
30   the suds like soap
31   gagging me with gulp-dull
32   sounds, and she's listening,
33   eyes rolling
34   like newsreel cameras,
35   and suddenly I have got to laugh,
36   I spiral out a whale-stream
37   of foam and liquid
38   majestic against the wallpaper
39   not knowing why,
40   and she laughs
41   looking down at my flat madness,

[Page 40 ]


42   she laughs
43   holding her cigarette
44   high in the air
45   with one arm
46   smoke sifting off
47   ignored
48   and we are in bed together
49   laughing
50   and we don't care
51   about anything
52   and it is very
53   very funny.

        Sparrow Press ]



1   in the slow Mexican air I watched the bull die
2   and they cut off his ear, and his great head held
3   no more terror than a rock.



4   driving back the next day we stopped at the Mission
5   and watched the golden red and blue flowers pulling
6   like tigers in the wind.



7   set this to metric: the bull, and the fort of Christ:
8   the matador on his knees, the dead bull his baby;
9   and the priest staring from the window
10   like a caged bear.



11   you may argue in the market place and pull at your
12   doubts with silken strings: I will only tell you
13   this: I have lived in both their temples,
14   believing all and nothing---perhaps, now, they will
15   die in mine.

1   it sits outside my window now
2   like an old woman going to market;
3   it sits and watches me,
4   it sweats nervously
5   through wire and fog and dog-bark
6   until suddenly
7   I slam the screen with a newspaper
8   like slapping at a fly
9   and you could hear the scream
10   over this plain city,
11   and then it left.



12   the way to end a poem
13   like this
14   is to become suddenly
15   quiet.

1   he carried a piece of
2   carbon, a blade and a whip
3   and at night he
4   feared his head
5   and covered it with blankets
6   until one morning in Los Angeles
7   it snowed
8   and I saw the snow
9   and I knew that my father
10   could control nothing,
11   and when
12   I got somewhat larger
13   and took my first boxcar
14   out, I sat there in
15   the lime
16   the burning lime
17   of having nothing
18   moving into the desert
19   for the first time
20   I sang.

1   red-eyed and dizzy as I
2   the bird came flying
3   all the way from Egypt
4   at 5 o'clock in the morning,
5   and Maria almost stumbled on her spikes:
6   what was it, a rocket?
7   and we went upstairs.
8   I poured two glasses of port
9   and we sat there as the money-grubbers
10   were belled out of their miserable nests
11   and Maria went in and watered
12   the bowl
13   and I sat there rubbing my three-day beard
14   thinking about the crazy bird
15   and it came out like this:
16   all that really mattered was
17   going someplace
18   the faster the better
19   because it left less waiting
20   to die. Maria came out
21   and peeled back the covers
22   and I tore off my greasy clothes
23   and crawled beneath the sweaty sheets,
24   closing my eyes to the sound and the sunlight,
25   and I heard her drop her spiked feet
26   and her frozen toes walked the backs of my calves
27   and I named the bird
28   Mr. America
29   and then quickly I went to sleep.

        Drowning in Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black
        Sparrow Press ]


1   there are these small cliffs
2   above the sea
3   and it is night, late night;
4   I have been unable to sleep,
5   and with my car above me
6   like a steel mother
7   I crawl down the cliffs,
8   breaking bits of rock
9   and being scratched by witless
10   and scrabby seaplants,
11   I make my way down
12   clumsy, misplaced,
13   an oddity on the shore,
14   and all around me are the lovers,
15   the two-headed beasts
16   turning to stare
17   at the madness
18   of a singular self;
19   shamed, I move on through them
20   to climb a row of wet boulders that
21   break the sea-stroke
22   into sheaths of white;
23   the moonlight is wet
24   on the bald stone
25   and now that I'm there
26   I don't want to be there
27   the sea stinks
28   and makes flushing sounds
29   like a toilet
30   it is a bad place to die;
31   any place is a bad place to die,
32   but better a yellow room
33   with known walls and dusty
34   lampshades; so ...
35   still stupidly off-course
36   like a jackal in a land of lions,
37   I make my way back through
38   them, through their blankets
39   and fires and kisses and sandy thumpings,
40   back up the cliff I climb

[Page 46 ]


41   worse off, kicking clods,
42   and there the black sky, the black sea
43   behind me
44   lost in the game,
45   and I have left my shoes down there
46   with them 2 empty shoes,
47   and in the car
48   I start the engine,
49   headlights on I back away,
50   swing left drive East,
51   climb up the land and out,
52   bare feet on worn ribbed rubber
53   out of there
54   looking for
55   another place.

        whore [from Burning in Water Drowning in Flame: Selected Poems
        1955-1973 (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   don't ever get the idea I am a poet; you can see me
2   at the racetrack any day half drunk
3   betting quarters, sidewheelers and straight thoroughs,
4   but let me tell you, there are some women there
5   who go where the money goes, and sometimes when you
6   look at these whores these onehundreddollar whores
7   you wonder sometimes if nature isn't playing a joke
8   dealing out so much breast and ass and the way
9   it's all hung together, you look and you look and
10   you look and you can't believe it; there are ordinary women
11   and then there is something else that wants to make you
12   tear up paintings and break albums of Beethoven
13   across the back of the john; anyhow, the season
14   was dragging and the big boys were getting busted,
15   all the non-pros, the producers, the cameramen,
16   the pushers of Mary, the fur salesmen, the owners
17   themselves, and Saint Louie was running this day:
18   a sidewheeler that broke when he got in close;
19   he ran with his head down and was mean and ugly
20   and 35 to 1, and I put a ten down on him.
21   the driver broke him wide
22   took him out by the fence where he'd be alone
23   even if he had to travel four times as far,
24   and that's the way he went it
25   all the way by the outer fence
26   traveling two miles in one
27   and he won like he was mad as hell
28   and he wasn't even tired,
29   and the biggest blonde of all
30   all ass and breast, hardly anything else
31   went to the payoff window with me.



32   that night I couldn't destroy her
33   although the springs shot sparks
34   and they pounded on the walls.
35   later she sat there in her slip
36   drinking Old Grandad
37   and she said
38   what's a guy like you doing
39   living in a dump like this?

[Page 48 ]


40   and I said
41   I'm a poet



42   and she threw back her beautiful head and laughed.



43   you? you ... a poet?



44   I guess you're right, I said, I guess you're right.



45   but still she looked good to me, she still looked good,
46   and all thanks to an ugly horse
47   who wrote this poem.

        Sparrow Press ]


1   I cross the room
2   to the last wall
3   the last window
4   the last pink sun
5   with its arms around the world
6   with its arms around me
7   I hear the death-whisper of the heron
8   the bone-thoughts of sea-things
9   that are almost rock;
10   this screen caved like a soul
11   and scrawled with flies,
12   my tensions and damnations
13   are those of a pig,
14   pink sun pink sun
15   I hate your holiness
16   crawling your gilded cross of life
17   as my fingers and feet and face
18   come down to this
19   sleeping with the whore of your fancy wife
20   you must some day die for nothing
21   as I
22   have lived.

        Water Drowning in Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black
        Sparrow Press ]


1   yes, they begin out in a willow, I think
2   the starch mountains begin out in the willow
3   and keep right on going without regard for
4   pumas and nectarines
5   somehow these mountains are like
6   an old woman with a bad memory and
7   a shopping basket.
8   we are in a basin. that is the
9   idea. down in the sand and the alleys,
10   this land punched-in, cuffed-out, divided,
11   held like a crucifix in a deathhand,
12   this land bought, resold, bought again and
13   sold again, the wars long over,
14   the Spaniards all the way back in Spain
15   down in the thimble again, and now
16   real estaters, subdividers, landlords, freeway
17   engineers arguing. this is their land and
18   I walk on it, live on it a little while
19   near Hollywood here I see young men in rooms
20   listening to glazed recordings
21   and I think too of old men sick of music
22   sick of everything, and death like suicide
23   I think is sometimes voluntary, and to get your
24   hold on the land here it is best to return to the
25   Grand Central Market, see the old Mexican women,
26   the poor ... I am sure you have seen these same women
27   many years before
28   arguing
29   with the same young Japanese clerks
30   witty, knowledgeable and golden
31   among their soaring store of oranges, apples
32   avocados, tomatoes, cucumbers---
33   and you know how /these/ look, they do look good
34   as if you could eat them all
35   light a cigar and smoke away the bad world.
36   then it's best to go back to the bars, the same bars
37   wooden, stale, merciless, green
38   with the young policeman walking through
39   scared and looking for trouble,

[Page 53 ]


40   and the beer is still bad
41   it has an edge that already mixes with vomit and
42   decay, and you've got to be strong in the shadows
43   to ignore it, to ignore the poor and to ignore yourself
44   and the shopping bag between your legs
45   down there feeling good with its avocados and
46   oranges and fresh fish and wine bottles, who needs
47   a Fort Lauderdale winter?
48   25 years ago there used to be a whore there
49   with a film over one eye, who was too fat
50   and made little silver bells out of cigarette
51   tinfoil. the sun seemed warmer then
52   although this was probably not
53   true, and you take your shopping bag
54   outside and walk along the street
55   and the green beer hangs there
56   just above your stomach like
57   a short and shameful shawl, and
58   you look around and no longer
59   see any
60   old men.

        Bukowski, Charles :  grass [from Burning in Water Drowning in
        Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   at the window
2   I watch a man with a
3   power mower
4   the sounds of his doing race like
5   flies and bees
6   on the wallpaper,
7   it is like a warm fire, and
8   better than eating steak,
9   and the grass is green enough
10   and the sun is sun enough
11   and what's left of my life
12   stands there
13   checking glints of green flying;
14   it is a giant disrobing of
15   care, stumbling away from
16   doing.



17   suddenly I understand
18   old men in rockers
19   bats in Colorado caves
20   tiny lice crawling into
21   the eyes of dead birds.



22   back and forth
23   he follows his gasoline
24   sound. it is
25   interesting enough,
26   with
27   the streets
28   flat on their Spring backs
29   and smiling.

        Bukowski, Charles :  fuzz [from Burning in Water Drowning in
        Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   3 small boys run toward me
2   blowing whistles
3   and they scream
4   /you're under arrest!/
5   /you're drunk!/
6   and they begin
7   hitting me on the legs with
8   their toy clubs.
9   one even has a
10   badge. another has
11   handcuffs but my hands are high in the air.



12   when I go into the liquor store
13   they whirl around outside
14   like bees
15   shut out from their nest.
16   I buy a fifth of cheap
17   whiskey
18   and
19   3
20   candy bars.

        Bukowski, Charles :  no lady godiva [from Burning in Water
        Drowning in Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black
        Sparrow Press ]



1   she came to my place drunk
2   riding a deer up on the front porch:
3   so many women want to save the world
4   but can't keep their own kitchens straight,
5   but /me/ ...
6   we went inside where I lit three red
7   candles
8   poured the wine and I took notes on
9   her:
10   latitude behind,
11   longitude in
12   front. and the
13   rest. amaz-
14   ing. a woman such as this
15   could find
16   a zinnia in Hot Springs
17   Arkansas.



18   we ate venison for three weeks.
19   then she slept with the landlord to help pay
20   the rent.
21   then I found her a job as a waitress.
22   I slept all day and when she came home
23   I was full of the brilliant conversation that she
24   so much
25   adored.



26   she died quickly one night leaving the world
27   much the way it had
28   been.



29   now I get up early and
30   go down to the loading docks and wait for
31   cabbages
32   oranges
33   potatoes
34   to fall from the trucks or to be
35   thrown away.

[Page 57 ]




36   by noon I have eaten and am asleep
37   dreaming of paying the rent
38   with numbered chunks of plastic
39   issued by a better
40   world.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the workers [from Burning in Water Drowning
        in Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   they laugh continually
2   even when
3   a board falls down
4   and destroys a face
5   or distorts a
6   body
7   they continue to
8   laugh,
9   when the color of the eye
10   becomes a fearful pale
11   because of the poor
12   light
13   they still laugh;
14   wrinkled and imbecile
15   at an early age
16   they joke about it:
17   a man who looks sixty
18   will say
19   I'm 32, and
20   then they'll laugh
21   they'll all laugh;
22   they are sometimes let
23   outside for a little air
24   but are chained to return
25   by chains they would not
26   break
27   if they could;
28   even outside, among
29   free men
30   they continue to laugh,
31   they walk about
32   with a hobbled and inane
33   gait
34   as if they'd lost their
35   senses; outside
36   they chew a little bread,
37   haggle, sleep, count their pennies,
38   gaze at the clock
39   and return;

[Page 59 ]





40   sometimes in the confines
41   they even grow serious
42   a moment, they speak of
43   /Outside,/ of how horrible
44   it must be
45   to be
46   shut /Outside/
47   forever, never to be let
48   back in;
49   it's warm as they work
50   and they sweat a
51   bit,
52   but they work hard and
53   well, they work so hard
54   the nerves revolt
55   and cause trembling,
56   but often they are
57   praised by those
58   who have risen up
59   out of them
60   like stars,
61   and now the stars
62   watch
63   watch too
64   for those few
65   who might attempt a
66   slower pace or
67   show disinterest
68   or falsify an
69   illness
70   in order to gain
71   rest (rest must be
72   /earned/ to gain strength
73   for a more perfect
74   job).



75   sometimes one dies
76   or goes mad
77   and then from /Outside/
78   a new one enters

[Page 60 ]


79   and is given
80   opportunity.



81   I have been there
82   many years;
83   at first I believed the work
84   monotonous, even
85   silly
86   but now I see
87   it all has meaning,
88   and the workers
89   without faces
90   I can see are not really
91   ugly, and that
92   the heads without eyes---
93   I know now that those eyes
94   can see
95   and are able to
96   do the work.
97   the women workers
98   are often the best,
99   adapting naturally,
100   and some of these I
101   made love to in our
102   resting hours; at first
103   they appeared to be
104   like female apes
105   but later
106   with insight
107   I realized
108   that they were things
109   as real and alive as
110   myself.



111   the other night
112   an old worker
113   grey and blind
114   no longer useful
115   was retired

[Page 61 ]


116   to the /Outside/ .



117   speech! speech!
118   we demanded.



119   it was
120   hell, he said.



121   we laughed
122   all 4000 of us:
123   he had kept his
124   humor
125   to the
126   end.

        Bukowski, Charles :  beans with garlic [from Burning in Water
        Drowning in Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black
        Sparrow Press ]


1   this is important enough:
2   to get your feelings down,
3   it is better than shaving
4   or cooking beans with garlic.
5   it is the little we can do
6   this small bravery of knowledge
7   and there is of course
8   madness and terror too
9   in knowing
10   that some part of you
11   wound up like a clock
12   can never be wound again
13   once it stops.
14   but now
15   there's a ticking under your shirt
16   and you whirl the beans with a spoon,
17   one love dead, one love departed
18   another love ...
19   ah! as many loves as beans
20   yes, count them now
21   sad, sad
22   your feelings boiling over flame,
23   get this down.

        Bukowski, Charles :  mama [from Burning in Water Drowning in
        Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   here I am
2   in the ground
3   my mouth
4   open
5   and
6   I can't even say
7   /mama/ ,
8   and
9   the dogs run by and stop and piss
10   on my stone; I get it all
11   except the sun
12   and my suit is looking
13   bad
14   and yesterday
15   the last of my left
16   arm gone
17   very little left, all harp-like
18   without music.



19   at least a drunk
20   in bed with a cigarette
21   might cause 5 fire
22   engines and
23   33 men.



24   I can't
25   do
26   any
27   thing.


28   but p.s.---Hector Richmond in the next
29   tomb thinks only of Mozart and candy
30   caterpillars.
31   he is
32   very bad
33   company.

        Bukowski, Charles :  machineguns towers & timeclocks [from
        Burning in Water Drowning in Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973
        (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   I feel gypped by dunces
2   as if reality were the property
3   of little men
4   with luck and a headstart,
5   and I sit in the cold
6   wondering about purple flowers
7   along a fence
8   while the rest of them
9   stack gold
10   and Cadillacs and
11   ladyfriends,
12   I wonder about palmleaves
13   and gravestones
14   and the preciousness of a
15   cocoon-like sleep;
16   to be a lizard would be
17   bad enough
18   to be scalding in the sun
19   would be bad enough
20   but not so bad
21   as being built up to
22   Man-size and Man-life
23   and not wanting the
24   game, not wanting
25   machineguns and towers and
26   timeclocks,
27   not wanting a carwash
28   a toothpull
29   a wristwatch, cufflinks
30   a pocket radio
31   tweezers and cotton
32   a cabinet full of iodine,
33   not wanting cocktail parties
34   a front lawn
35   sing-togethers
36   new shoes, Christmas presents
37   life insurance, /Newsweek/
38   162 baseball games
39   a vacation in Bermuda.
40   not wanting not wanting,
41   and I judge the purple flowers

[Page 65 ]


42   better off than I
43   the lizard better off
44   the dark green hose
45   the ever grass
46   the trees the birds,
47   the cats dreaming in the butter
48   sun are
49   better off than
50   I, getting into this old coat now
51   feeling for my cigarettes
52   car keys
53   a roadmap back,
54   going out
55   down the walk
56   like a man to be executed
57   walking toward it
58   surely,
59   going into it
60   without guards
61   driving toward it
62   racing at it
63   70 miles per hour,
64   jockeying
65   cussing
66   dropping ashes
67   deadly ashes of every
68   deadly thing
69   burning,
70   the caterpillar knows less
71   horror
72   the armies of ants are
73   braver
74   the kiss of a snake
75   less ravenous,
76   I only want the sky
77   to burn me more and more
78   burn me out
79   so that the sun begins at
80   6 in the morning
81   and goes past midnight
82   like a drunken door always open,

[Page 66 ]


83   I drive toward it
84   not wanting it
85   getting it getting it
86   as the cat stretches
87   yawns
88   and rolls over into
89   another dream.

        Bukowski, Charles :  something for the touts, the nuns, the
        grocery clerks and you ... [from Burning in Water Drowning in
        Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   we have everything and we have nothing
2   and some men do it in churches
3   and some men do it by tearing butterflies
4   in half
5   and some men do it in Palm Springs
6   laying it into butterblondes
7   with Cadillac souls
8   Cadillacs and butterflies
9   nothing and everything,
10   the face melting down to the last puff
11   in a cellar in Corpus Christi.
12   there's something for the touts, the nuns,
13   the grocery clerks and you ...
14   something at 8 a.m., something in the library
15   something in the river,
16   everything and nothing.
17   in the slaughterhouse it comes running along
18   the ceiling on a hook, and you swing it---
19   one
20   two
21   three
22   and then you've got it, $200 worth of dead
23   meat, its bones against your bones
24   something and nothing.
25   it's always early enough to die and
26   it's always too late,
27   and the drill of blood in the basin white
28   it tells you nothing at all
29   and the gravediggers playing poker over
30   5 a.m. coffee, waiting for the grass
31   to dismiss the frost ...
32   they tell you nothing at all.



33   we have everything and we have nothing---
34   days with glass edges and the impossible stink
35   of river moss---worse than shit;
36   checkerboard days of moves and countermoves,

[Page 68 ]


37   fagged interest, with as much sense in defeat as
38   in victory; slow days like mules
39   humping it slagged and sullen and sun-glazed
40   up a road where a madman sits waiting among
41   bluejays and wrens netted in and sucked a flakey
42   grey.
43   good days too of wine and shouting, fights
44   in alleys, fat legs of women striving around
45   your bowels buried in moans,
46   the signs in bullrings like diamonds hollering
47   Mother Capri, violets coming out of the ground
48   telling you to forget the dead armies and the loves
49   that robbed you.
50   days when children say funny and brilliant things
51   like savages trying to send you a message through
52   their bodies while their bodies are still
53   alive enough to transmit and feel and run up
54   and down without locks and paychecks and
55   ideals and possessions and beetle-like
56   opinions.
57   days when you can cry all day long in
58   a green room with the door locked, days
59   when you can laugh at the breadman
60   because his legs are too long, days
61   of looking at hedges ...



62   and nothing, and nothing. the days of
63   the bosses, yellow men
64   with bad breath and big feet, men
65   who look like frogs, hyenas, men who walk
66   as if melody had never been invented, men
67   who think it is intelligent to hire and fire and
68   profit, men with expensive wives they possess
69   like 60 acres of ground to be drilled
70   or shown-off or to be walled away from
71   the incompetent, men who'd kill you
72   because they're crazy and justify it because
73   it's the law, men who stand in front of
74   windows 30 feet wide and see nothing,
75   men with luxury yachts who can sail around

[Page 69 ]


76   the world and yet never get out of their vest
77   pockets, men like snails, men like eels, men
78   like slugs, and not as good ...



79   and nothing. getting your last paycheck
80   at a harbor, at a factory, at a hospital, at an
81   aircraft plant, at a penny arcade, at a
82   barbershop, at a job you didn't want
83   anyway.
84   income tax, sickness, servility, broken
85   arms, broken heads---all the stuffing
86   come out like an old pillow.



87   we have everything and we have nothing.
88   some do it well enough for a while and
89   then give way. fame gets them or disgust
90   or age or lack of proper diet or ink
91   across the eyes or children in college
92   or new cars or broken backs while skiing
93   in Switzerland or new politics or new wives
94   or just natural change and decay---
95   the man you knew yesterday hooking
96   for ten rounds or drinking for three days and
97   three nights by the Sawtooth mountains now
98   just something under a sheet or a cross
99   or a stone or under an easy delusion,
100   or packing a bible or a golf bag or a
101   briefcase: how they go, how they go!---all
102   the ones you thought would never go.



103   days like this. like your day today.
104   maybe the rain on the window trying to
105   get through to you. what do you see today?
106   what is it? where are you? the best
107   days are sometimes the first, sometimes
108   the middle and even sometimes the last.
109   the vacant lots are not bad, churches in
110   Europe on postcards are not bad. people in

[Page 70 ]


111   wax museums frozen into their best sterility
112   are not bad, horrible but not bad. the
113   cannon, think of the cannon. and toast for
114   breakfast the coffee hot enough you
115   know your tongue is still there. three
116   geraniums outside a window, trying to be
117   red and trying to be pink and trying to be
118   geraniums. no wonder sometimes the women
119   cry, no wonder the mules don't want
120   to go up the hill. are you in a hotel room
121   in Detroit looking for a cigarette? one more
122   good day. a little bit of it. and as
123   the nurses come out of the building after
124   their shift, having had enough, eight nurses
125   with different names and different places
126   to go---walking across the lawn, some of them
127   want cocoa and a paper, some of them want a
128   hot bath, some of them want a man, some
129   of them are hardly thinking at all. enough
130   and not enough. arcs and pilgrims, oranges
131   gutters, ferns, antibodies, boxes of
132   tissue paper.



133   in the most decent sometimes sun
134   there is the softsmoke feeling from urns
135   and the canned sound of old battleplanes
136   and if you go inside and run your finger
137   along the window ledge you'll find
138   dirt, maybe even earth.
139   and if you look out the window
140   there will be the day, and as you
141   get older you'll keep looking
142   keep looking
143   sucking your tongue in a little
144   ah ah no no maybe



145   some do it naturally
146   some obscenely
147   everywhere.

        Drowning in Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black
        Sparrow Press ]


1   sway with me, everything sad---
2   madmen in stone houses
3   without doors,
4   lepers streaming love and song
5   frogs trying to figure
6   the sky;
7   sway with me, sad things---
8   fingers split on a forge
9   old age like breakfast shells
10   used books, used people
11   used flowers, used love
12   I need you
13   I need you
14   I need you:
15   /it/ has run away
16   like a horse or a dog,
17   dead or lost
18   or unforgiving.

        Water Drowning in Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black
        Sparrow Press ]


1   the essence of the belly
2   like a white balloon sacked
3   is disturbing
4   like the running of feet
5   on the stairs
6   when you don't know
7   who is there.
8   of course, if you turn on the radio
9   you might forget
10   the fat under your shirt
11   or the rats lined up in order
12   like old women on Hollywood Blvd
13   waiting on a comedy
14   show.
15   I think of old men
16   in four dollar rooms
17   looking for socks in dresser drawers
18   while standing in brown underwear
19   all the time the clock ticking on
20   warm as a
21   cobra.
22   ah, there are some decent things, maybe:
23   the sky, the circus
24   the legs of ladies getting out of cars,
25   the peach coming through the door
26   like a Mozart symphony.
27   the scale says 198. that's what
28   I weigh. it is 2:10 a.m.
29   dedication is for chess players.
30   the glorious single cause is
31   waiting on the anvil
32   while
33   smoking, pissing, reading Genet
34   or the funny papers;
35   but maybe it's early enough yet
36   to write your aunt in
37   Palm Springs and tell her
38   what's wrong.

        Bukowski, Charles :  no. 6 [from Burning in Water Drowning in

1   I'll settle for the 6 horse
2   on a rainy afternoon
3   a paper cup of coffee
4   in my hand
5   a little way to go,
6   the wind twirling out
7   small wrens from
8   the upper grandstand roof,
9   the jocks coming out
10   for a middle race
11   silent
12   and the easy rain making
13   everything
14   at once
15   almost alike,
16   the horses at peace with
17   each other
18   before the drunken war
19   and I am under the grandstand
20   feeling for
21   cigarettes
22   settling for coffee,
23   then the horses walk by
24   taking their little men
25   away---
26   it is funereal and graceful
27   and glad
28   like the opening
29   of flowers.

        Bukowski, Charles :  don't come round but if you do ... [from
        Burning in Water Drowning in Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973
        (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   yeah sure, I'll be in unless I'm out
2   don't knock if the lights are out
3   or you hear voices or then
4   I might be reading Proust
5   if someone slips Proust under my door
6   or one of his bones for my stew,
7   and I can't loan money or
8   the phone
9   or what's left of my car
10   though you can have yesterday's newspaper
11   an old shirt or a bologna sandwich
12   or sleep on the couch
13   if you don't scream at night
14   and you can talk about yourself
15   that's only normal;
16   hard times are upon us all
17   only I am not trying to raise a family
18   to send through Harvard
19   or buy hunting land,
20   I am not aiming high
21   I am only trying to keep myself alive
22   just a little longer,
23   so if you sometimes knock
24   and I don't answer
25   and there isn't a woman in here
26   maybe I have broken my jaw
27   and am looking for wire
28   or I am chasing the butterflies in
29   my wallpaper,
30   I mean if I don't answer
31   I don't answer, and the reason is
32   that I am not yet ready to kill you
33   or love you, or even accept you,
34   it means I don't want to talk
35   I am busy, I am mad, I am glad
36   or maybe I'm stringing up a rope;
37   so even if the lights are on
38   and you hear sound
39   like breathing or praying or singing
40   a radio or the roll of dice
41   or typing---

[Page 75 ]


42   go away, it is not the day
43   the night, the hour;
44   it is not the ignorance of impoliteness,
45   I wish to hurt nothing, not even a bug
46   but sometimes I gather evidence of a kind
47   that takes some sorting,
48   and your blue eyes, be they blue
49   and your hair, if you have some
50   or your mind---they cannot enter
51   until the rope is cut or knotted
52   or until I have shaven into
53   new mirrors, until the world is
54   stopped or opened
55   forever.

        Black Sparrow Press ]



1   in grievous deity my cat
2   walks around
3   he walks around and around
4   with
5   electric tail and
6   push-button
7   eyes



8   he is
9   alive and
10   plush and
11   final as a plum tree



12   neither of us understands
13   cathedrals or
14   the man outside
15   watering his
16   lawn



17   if I were all the man
18   that he is
19   cat---
20   if there were men
21   like this
22   the world could
23   begin



24   he leaps up on the couch
25   and walks through
26   porticoes of my
27   admiration.

        Bukowski, Charles :  stew [from Burning in Water Drowning in
        Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   stew at noon, my dear; and look:
2   the ants, the sawdust, the mica
3   plants, the shadows of banks like
4   bad jokes;
5   do you think we'll hear
6   /The Bartered Bride/ today?
7   how's your tooth?



8   I should wash my feet and
9   clean my nails
10   not that I'd feel more like Christ
11   but
12   less like a leper---
13   which is important when
14   poverty is a small game you play
15   with your time.



16   let's see: first the mailman
17   then yesterday's copy of the /Times/ .
18   we might
19   this way
20   get blown up a day too
21   late.



22   then there's the library or
23   a walk down the boulevards.



24   many great men have
25   walked down the boulevards
26   but it's terrible to be
27   a great man



28   like a monkey carrying a 5 pound
29   sack of potatoes up a 40 foot hill.

[Page 78 ]





30   Paris can wait.



31   more salt?



32   after we eat
33   let's sleep, let's sleep.



34   we can't make any money
35   awake.

        Bukowski, Charles :  lilies in my brain [from Burning in Water
        Drowning in Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black
        Sparrow Press ]



1   the lilies storm my brain
2   by god by god
3   like nazi storm troopers!
4   do you think I'm going
5   tizzy?



6   your blue sweater
7   with tits hanging
8   loose, and
9   I think vaguely of Christ
10   on the cross, I don't know
11   why, and icecream
12   cones. this July day
13   lilies storm my brain,
14   I'll remember this
15   but
16   if only I had a
17   camera
18   or a big dog walking beside
19   me. big dogs make things
20   concrete
21   /don't they?/
22   a big dog to wrinkle his
23   snot-nose
24   like this lake gypped of
25   clear surface
26   by a quick and clever
27   wind.



28   you're here, yet I'm sad
29   again. I feel my porkchop ribs
30   over my lambchop heart /ugh/
31   gullible hard-working
32   intestines, dejected penis
33   chewing-gum bladder
34   liver turning to fat
35   like a penny-arcade trout
36   ashamed buttocks
37   practical ears

[Page 80 ]


38   moth-like hands
39   spearfish nose
40   rock-slide mouth and
41   the rest. the rest:
42   lilies in my brain
43   hoping good times
44   thinking old times:
45   Capone and the diamonds
46   Charlie Chaplin
47   Laurel and Hardy
48   Clara Bow
49   the rest.



50   it never happened
51   but it /seemed/ like
52   there were times when rot
53   stopped
54   waited like a streetcar
55   at a signal.



56   now I
57   like a movie punk
58   (lilies up there)
59   take your hand
60   and we walk forward
61   to rent a boat
62   to drown in. I breathe the wind, flex my muscles
63   but only my belly
64   wiggles.



65   we get in
66   the motor churns the
67   slime.
68   the city buildings
69   come down like ostrich
70   mouths
71   and hollow out
72   our brains

[Page 81 ]


73   yet the sun
74   comes in
75   /zap! zap! zap!/
76   brilliant germs crawl our
77   chapped flesh. my
78   I feel as if I were in
79   church: everything
80   stinks. I hold the rubber sides
81   of everywhere
82   my balls are snowballs
83   I see stricken bells of malaria
84   old men getting into
85   bed, into model-T Fords
86   as the fish swim below us
87   full of dirty words and macaroni
88   and crossword puzzles
89   and the death of me, you and
90   the Katzenjammer
91   kids.

        Bukowski, Charles :  i am dead but i know the dead are not like
        this [from Burning in Water Drowning in Flame: Selected Poems

1   the dead can sleep
2   they don't get up and rage
3   they don't have a wife.



4   her white face
5   like a flower in a closed
6   window lifts up and
7   looks at me.



8   the curtain smokes a cigarette
9   and a moth dies in a
10   freeway crash
11   as I examine the shadows of my
12   hands.



13   an owl, the size of a baby clock
14   rings for me, /come on come on/
15   it says as Jerusalem is hustled
16   down crotch-stained halls.



17   the 5 a.m. grass is nasal now
18   in hums of battleships and valleys
19   in the raped light that brings on
20   the fascist birds.



21   I put out the lamp and get in bed
22   beside her, she thinks I'm there
23   mumbles a rosy gratitude
24   as I stretch my legs
25   to coffin length
26   get in and swim away
27   from frogs and fortunes.

1   in the earliest possible day
2   in the blue-headed noon
3   I will telegraph you
4   a
5   boney hand
6   decorated with
7   sharkskin
8   a
9   large boy with
10   yellow teeth and an epileptic
11   father
12   will bring it
13   to your

15   smile

18   it is better than

        Sparrow Press ]



1   she wrote me a letter from a small
2   room near the Seine.
3   she said she was going to dancing
4   class. she got up, she said
5   at 5 o'clock in the morning
6   and typed at poems
7   or painted
8   and when she felt like crying
9   she had a special bench
10   by the river.



11   her book of /Songs/
12   would be out
13   in the Fall.



14   I did not know what to tell her
15   but
16   I told her
17   to get any bad teeth pulled
18   and be careful of the French
19   lover.



20   I put her photo by the radio
21   near the fan
22   and it moved
23   like something
24   alive.



25   I sat and watched it
26   until I had smoked the
27   5 or 6
28   cigarettes left.



29   then I got up
30   and went to bed.

1   she reads to me from the /New Yorker/
2   which I don't buy, don't know
3   how they get in here, but it's
4   something about the Mafia
5   one of the heads of the Mafia
6   who ate too much and had it too easy
7   too many fine women patting his
8   walnuts, and he got fat sucking at good
9   cigars and young breasts and he
10   has these heart attacks---and so
11   one day somebody is driving him
12   in this big car along the road
13   and he doesn't feel so good
14   and he asks the boy to stop and let
15   him out and the boy lays him out
16   along the road in the fine sunshine.
17   I don't know whether it's Crete or
18   Sicily or Italy proper
19   but he's lying there in the sunshine
20   and before he dies he says:
21   how beautiful life can be, and
22   then he's gone.



23   sometimes you've got to kill 4 or 5
24   thousand men before you somehow
25   get to believe that the sparrow
26   is immortal, money is piss and
27   that you have been wasting
28   your time.

        Bukowski, Charles :  woman [from Burning in Water Drowning in

1   this head like a saucer
2   decorated with everything
3   as lip to lip we hang
4   in mechanical joy;
5   my hands blaze with arias
6   but I think of books
7   on anatomy,
8   and I fall from you
9   as nations burn in anger ...



10   to recover from most pitiful error
11   and rebuild, this is it
12   loss and mending
13   until they take us in.



14   the glory of a Saturday afternoon
15   like biting into an old peach
16   and you walk across the room
17   heavy with everything
18   except my love.

1   yesterday drunken Alice
2   gave me
3   a jar of fig jam
4   and today she
5   whistles
6   for her cat
7   but
8   he will not
9   come---
10   he is with the horses
11   at a
12   tub of beer
13   or
14   in room 21
15   at the Crown Hill
16   Hotel
17   or he is at the
18   Crocker
19   Citizens National
20   Bank
21   or
22   he arrived in
23   New York City at
24   5:30 p.m.
25   with paper suitcase
26   and
27   $7.



28   next to Alice
29   in her yard
30   a paper goose
31   walks
32   upside down
33   on a carton that says:
34   California
35   Oranges.



36   drunken Alice whistles.

[Page 88 ]




37   no good. no good.
38   work slowly.
39   everybody tries hard
40   but the
41   gods.



42   Alice goes in for a
43   drink, comes
44   out.
45   whistles again
46   all the way to a
47   park bench in
48   El Paso---
49   and her love comes
50   running out of the
51   bushes
52   bright-eyed as a
53   color film
54   and not waiting
55   for
56   Monday.



57   we go in
58   together.

        Bukowski, Charles :  a nice day [from Burning in Water Drowning
        in Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   the virus holds
2   the concepts give way like rotten
3   shoelaces
4   toothache and bacon dance on the
5   lawn
6   I open a drawer to dirty
7   stockings
8   a stockbroker's universe
9   steel balls flutter like
10   butterflies
11   I can feel doom like
12   something under the sheets with bristles
13   that stinks and moves
14   toward me
15   the mailman is insane and
16   hands me a bagful of snails
17   eaten inside
18   out
19   by some rat of decay
20   in the madhouse a man kisses the walls
21   and dreams of sailboating down some
22   cool Nile
23   I read about the bullfights the ballgames
24   the boxing matches
25   things continue to fight
26   and in the churches they play at parlor
27   games and peek at legs
28   I go outside to absolutely
29   nothing
30   a square round of orange zero
31   headpieces over obscene mouths that form
32   at me like suckerfish
33   good morning, nice day isn't it?
34   a fat woman says
35   I am unable to answer
36   and down the sidewalk I go
37   shamed
38   unable to tell her
39   of the knife inside me
40   I do notice though the sun is shining
41   that the flowers are pulled up on

[Page 94 ]


42   their strings
43   and I on mine:
44   belly, bellybutton, buttocks, bukowski
45   waving walking
46   teeth of ice with the taste of tar
47   tear ducts propagandized
48   shoes acting like shoes
49   I arrive on time
50   in the blazing midday of
51   mourning.

        Bukowski, Charles :  beerbottle [from Burning in Water Drowning
        in Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   a very miraculous thing just happened:
2   my beerbottle flipped over backwards
3   and landed on its bottom on the floor,
4   and I have set it upon the table to foam down,
5   but the photos were not so lucky today
6   and there is a small slit along the leather
7   of my left shoe, but it's all very simple:
8   we cannot acquire too much: there are laws
9   we know nothing of, all manner of nudges
10   set us to burning or freezing; what sets
11   the blackbird in the cat's mouth
12   is not for us to say, or why some men
13   are jailed like pet squirrels
14   while others nuzzle in enormous breasts
15   through endless nights---this is the
16   task and the terror, and we are not
17   taught why. still, it's lucky the bottle
18   landed straightside up, and although
19   I have one of wine and one of whiskey,
20   this foretells, somehow, a good night,
21   and perhaps tomorrow my nose will be longer:
22   new shoes, less rain, more poems.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the body [from Burning in Water Drowning in
        Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I have been
2   hanging here
3   headless
4   for so long
5   that the body has forgotten
6   why
7   or where or when it
8   happened



9   and the toes
10   walk along in shoes
11   that do not
12   care



13   and although
14   the fingers
15   slice things and
16   hold things and
17   move things and
18   touch
19   things
20   such as
21   oranges
22   apples
23   onions
24   books
25   bodies
26   I am no longer
27   reasonably sure
28   what these things
29   are



30   they are mostly
31   like
32   lamplight and
33   fog

[Page 99 ]





34   then often the hands will
35   go to the
36   lost head
37   and hold the head
38   like the hands of a
39   child
40   around a ball
41   a block
42   air and wood---
43   no teeth
44   no thinking part



45   and when a window
46   blows open
47   to a
48   church
49   hill
50   woman
51   dog
52   or something singing



53   the fingers of the hand
54   are senseless to vibration
55   because they have no
56   ears
57   senseless to color because
58   they have no
59   eyes
60   senseless to smell
61   without a nose



62   the country goes by as
63   nonsense
64   the continents



65   the daylights and evenings
66   shine

[Page 100 ]


67   on my dirty
68   fingernails



69   and in some mirror
70   my face
71   a block to vanish
72   scuffed part of a child's
73   ball



74   while everywhere
75   moves
76   worms and aircraft
77   fires on the land
78   tall violets in sanctity
79   my hands let go let go
80   let go

        Bukowski, Charles :  k.o. [from Burning in Water Drowning in

1   he was easy, fat as a hummingbird
2   and I had him blowing,
3   I jabbed and crossed and took my time:
4   everybody was waiting for the main event,
5   drinking beer, and I was thinking
6   how we were going to furnish the house,
7   I needed a workbench and some tools,
8   and then he came over with the right---
9   I had been looking at the lights
10   and the next thing I knew everybody was
11   howling, and I was down on my knees like
12   praying, and when I got up
13   he was strong and I was weak;
14   well, I thought, I'll go back to the farm,
15   I always was a poor winner.

/spinach, Gabriel,/
/all fall down,/
/all fall down and blow,/
/barbados, barbados,/
/where are yr toes?/


1   the branches break, the birds fall, the buildings burn,
2   the whores stand straight,
3   the bombs stack,
4   evening, morning, night,
5   peanutbutter,
6   peanutbutter falcons,
7   rain breathing like lilies from the top of my head,
8   pincers pincers
9   kisses like steel clamps
10   mouths full of moths,
11   hydra-headed cocksuckers,
12   Florida in full moon,
13   shark with mouthful of man
14   man with mouthful of peanutbutter, rain
15   rain peeking into the guts of grey hours,
16   horses dreaming of horses,
17   flowers dreaming of flowers,
18   horses running with greyhour pieces of my lovely flesh,
19   bread burning, all Spain on fire and
20   cities dreaming of craters,
21   bombs bigger than the brains of anything,
22   going down
23   are the clocks cocks roosters?
24   the roosters stand on the fence
25   the roosters are peanutbutter crowing,
26   the FLAME will be high, the flame will be big,
27   kiss kiss kiss
28   everything away,
29   I hope it rains today, I hope
30   the jets die, I hope
31   the kitten finds a mouse, I hope
32   I don't see it, I hope
33   it rains, I hope

[Page 103 ]


34   anything away from here,
35   I hope a bridge, a fish, a cactus somewhere
36   strutting whiskers to the noon,
37   I dream flowers and horses
38   the branches break the birds fall the buildings
39   burn, my whore walks across the room and
40   smiles at me.

        Bukowski, Charles :  7th race when the angels swung low and
        burned [from Burning in Water Drowning in Flame: Selected Poems
        1955-1973 (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I watched the board and the 6 dropped to 9
2   after a first flash of 18 from a morning line
3   of 12 ... two minutes to post and a fat man
4   kept jamming against my back, but I made it,
5   I bet 20 to win and walked out to the deck
6   looking down at my program:
7   purple and cerise quarters, cerise sleeves
8   and cap; b.f.3., Indian Red---Impetuous, by Top Row,
9   and people kept walking into me
10   although there was no place to go,
11   they were putting them in the gate
12   and the people were walking like ants over spilled
13   sugar,
14   the machine had cranked them up to die
15   and they were blind with it,
16   and now by the 7th race
17   stinking sweating broke ugly
18   reamed
19   there was no way back to the dream,
20   and the horses came out of the gate
21   and I looked for my colors---
22   I saw them, and the boy seemed to be riding sideways
23   he had the horse running in and was pulling his head back
24   toward the outer rail,
25   and I could tell by the way the horse was striding
26   that he was out of it;
27   the action had been all wrong
28   and I walked to the bar
29   while the winners turned into the stretch,
30   and they were making the final calls as I ordered my drink,
31   and I leaned there thinking
32   I once knew places that sweetly cried
33   their walls' voices
34   where mirrors showed me chance,
35   I was once saddened when an evening became
36   finally a night to sleep away.



37   ---the bartender said, I hear they are going to send in
38   the 7 horse in the next one.

[Page 105 ]


39   I once sang operas and burned candles
40   in a place made holy by nothing but myself
41   and whatever there was.



42   ---I never bet mares in the summer,
43   I told him.



44   then the crowd came on in
45   complaining
46   explaining
47   bragging
48   thinking of suicide or drunkenness or sex,
49   and I looked around
50   like a man waking up in jail
51   and whatever there was
52   became that,
53   and I finished my drink
54   and walked away.

        Bukowski, Charles :  on going out to get the mail [from Burning
        in Water Drowning in Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) ,
        Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the droll noon
2   where squadrons of worms creep up like
3   stripteasers
4   to be raped by blackbirds.



5   I go outside
6   and all up and down the street
7   the green armies shoot color
8   like an everlasting 4th of July,
9   and I too seem to swell inside,
10   a kind of unknown bursting, a
11   feeling, perhaps, that there isn't any
12   enemy
13   anywhere.



14   and I reach down into the box
15   and there is
16   nothing---not even a
17   letter from the gas co. saying they will
18   shut it off
19   again.



20   not even a short note from my x-wife
21   bragging about her present
22   happiness.



23   my hand searches the mailbox in a kind of
24   disbelief long after the mind has
25   given up.



26   there's not even a dead fly
27   down in there.



28   I am a fool, I think, I should have known it
29   works like this.

[Page 107 ]





30   I go inside as all the flowers leap to
31   please me.



32   anything? the woman
33   asks.



34   nothing, I answer, what's for
35   breakfast?

        Bukowski, Charles :  i wanted to overthrow the government but

1   30 dogs, 20 men on 20 horses and one fox
2   and look here, they write,
3   you are a dupe for the state, the church,
4   you are in the ego-dream,
5   read your history, study the monetary system,
6   note that the racial war is 23,000 years old.



7   well, I remember 20 years ago, sitting with an old Jewish tailor,
8   his nose in the lamplight like a cannon sighted on the enemy; and
9   there was an Italian pharmacist who lived in an expensive apartment
10   in the best part of town; we plotted to overthrow
11   a tottering dynasty, the tailor sewing buttons on a vest,
12   the Italian poking his cigar in my eye, lighting me up,
13   a tottering dynasty myself, always drunk as possible,
14   well-read, starving, depressed, but actually
15   a good young piece of ass would have solved all my rancor,
16   but I didn't know this; I listened to my Italian and my Jew
17   and I went out down dark alleys smoking borrowed cigarettes
18   and watching the backs of houses come down in flames,
19   but somewhere we missed: we were not men enough,
20   large or small enough,
21   or we only wanted to talk or we were bored, so the anarchy
22   fell through,
23   and the Jew died and the Italian grew angry because I stayed
24   with his
25   wife when he went down to the pharmacy; he did not care to have
26   his /personal/ government overthrown, and she overthrew easy, and
27   I had some guilt: the children were asleep in the other bedroom;
28   but later I won $200 in a crap game and took a bus to New Orleans,
29   and I stood on the corner listening to the music coming from bars
30   and then I went inside to the bars,
31   and I sat there thinking about the dead Jew,
32   how all he did was sew on buttons and talk,
33   and how he gave way although he was stronger than any of us---
34   he gave way because his bladder would not go on,
35   and maybe that saved Wall Street and Manhattan
36   and the Church and Central Park West and Rome and the
37   Left Bank, but the pharmacist's wife, she was nice,

[Page 109 ]


38   she was tired of bombs under the pillow and hissing the Pope,
39   and she had a very nice figure, very good legs,
40   but I guess she felt as I: that the weakness was not Government
41   but Man, one at a time, that men were never as strong as
42   their ideas
43   and that ideas were governments turned into men;
44   and so it began on a couch with a spilled martini
45   and it ended in the bedroom: desire, revolution,
46   nonsense ended, and the shades rattled in the wind,
47   rattled like sabres, cracked like cannon,
48   and 30 dogs, 20 men on 20 horses chased one fox
49   across the fields under the sun,
50   and I got out of bed and yawned and scratched my belly
51   and knew that soon very soon I would have to get
52   very drunk again.

4   for
5   5 years
6   and it has gathered
7   a bachelor's dust

15   busy
16   to notice
17   until now

1   it is not very good
2   to not get through
3   whether it's the
4   wall
5   the human mind
6   sleep
7   wakefulness
8   sex
9   excretion
10   or most anything
11   you can name
12   or
13   can't name.

15   catches its worm
16   the chicken gets through
17   and when the worm
18   catches you
19   (dead or alive)
20   I'd have to say,
21   even through its lack
22   of sensibility,
23   that it enjoys
24   it.



25   it's like when you
26   send this poem
27   back
28   I'll figure
29   it just didn't get
30   through.



31   either there were
32   fatter worms

34   couldn't
35   see.

1   they found him walking along the freeway
2   all red in
3   front
4   he had taken a rusty tin can
5   and cut off his sexual
6   machinery
7   as if to say---
8   see what you've done to
9   me? you might as well have the
10   rest.



11   and he put part of him
12   in one pocket and
13   part of him in
14   another
15   and that's how they found him,
16   walking
17   along.



18   they gave him over to the
19   doctors
20   who tried to sew the parts
21   back
22   on
23   but the parts were
24   quite contented
25   they way they
26   were.



27   I think sometimes of all the good
28   ass
29   turned over to the
30   monsters of the
31   world.



32   maybe it was his protest against
33   this or

35   against
36   everything.

1   he hooked to the body hard
2   took it well
3   and loved to fight
4   had seven in a row and a small fleck
5   over one eye,
6   and then he met a kid from Camden
7   with arms thin as wires---
8   it was a good one,
9   the safe lions roared and threw money;
10   they were both up and down many times,
11   but he lost that one
12   and he lost the rematch
13   in which neither of them fought at all,
14   hanging on to each other like lovers through the boos,
15   and now he's over at Mike's
16   changing tires and oil and batteries,
17   the fleck over the eye
18   still young,
19   but you don't ask him,
20   you don't ask him anything
21   except maybe
22   you think it's going to rain?
23   or
24   you think the sun's gonna come out?

26   hell no,

        Bukowski, Charles :  class [from Burning in Water Drowning in
        Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   these boys have got class
2   they ought to make kings
3   out of old men
4   rolling cigarettes
5   in rooms small enough
6   to recognize
7   a single shadow;
8   for them
9   all has gone away
10   like a light under the
11   door
12   yet
13   they recognize and
14   bear the absence;
15   tricked and slugged to
16   zero
17   they wait on death
18   with the temperate patience of
19   a mother teaching her child
20   to eat;
21   for them, everything has
22   run away
23   like a rose in the mouth
24   of a hog;
25   the burning of cities
26   must have been
27   like this.
28   but like trucks of garbage
29   shaking with love
30   these boys
31   might
32   rise like Lorca
33   out of the road
34   with one more poem,
35   rise like
36   Lazarus to
37   gaze upon the
38   still living female,
39   and then
40   get drunk
41   drunk

[Page 117 ]


42   until it all
43   falls apart
44   so sad
45   again.

        Bukowski, Charles :  living [from Burning in Water Drowning in
        Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I mean, I just slept
2   I awoke with a fly on my elbow and
3   I named the fly Benny
4   then I killed him
5   and then I got up and looked in the
6   mailbox
7   and there was some kind of warning from the
8   government
9   but since there wasn't anybody standing in the bushes with
10   a bayonet
11   I tore it up
12   and went back to bed and looked up at the ceiling
13   and I thought, I really like this,
14   I'm just going to lie here for another ten
15   minutes
16   and I lay there for another ten minutes
17   and I thought,
18   it doesn't make sense, I've got so many things to
19   do but I'm going to lie here another
20   half hour,
21   and I stretched
22   stretched
23   and I watched the sun through the small leaves of a tree
24   outside, and I didn't have any wonderful thoughts,
25   I didn't have any immortal thoughts,
26   and that was the best part
27   and it got a little hot
28   and I threw the blankets off and slept---
29   but a damned dream:
30   I was on the train again
31   on that same 5 hour round-trip to the track,
32   sitting by the window,
33   past the same sad ocean, China out there mouthing
34   peculiarities in the back of my
35   brain, and then somebody sat next to me
36   and talked about /horses/
37   mothballs of talk that ripped me apart like
38   death, and then I was there
39   again: the horses running like something shown on a
40   screen and the jockeys very white in the face
41   and it didn't matter who finally

[Page 119 ]


42   won and everybody knew
43   it, the ride back in the dream was the same as the ride
44   back in reality:
45   black tons of night around
46   the same mountains ashamed of being
47   there, the sea again, again,
48   the train heading like a cock through a needle's
49   eye
50   and I had to get up and go to the urinal
51   and I hated to get up and go to the urinal
52   because somebody had thrown paper, some loser had thrown paper
53   into the toilet again and it wouldn't
54   flush, and when I came back out
55   everybody had nothing to do but look at my
56   face
57   and I am so tired
58   that they know when they see my face
59   that I hate
60   them
61   and then they hate me
62   and want to
63   kill me
64   but don't.
65   I woke up but since there wasn't anybody
66   over my bed
67   to tell me I was doing
68   wrong
69   I slept some
70   more.
71   when I woke up this time
72   it was almost
73   evening. people were coming in from work.
74   I got up and sat in a chair and watched them
75   coming in. they didn't look so good.
76   even the young girls didn't look so good as when they
77   left.
78   and the men came in: hatchet men, killers, thieves, con-men,
79   the whole bunch, and their faces were more horrible than any
80   halloween masks ever devised.

[Page 120 ]





81   I found a blue spider in the corner and killed him with a
82   broom.



83   I looked at the people a while more and then I got tired and
84   stopped looking and fried myself a couple of eggs and sat down
85   and had some tea and bread with it.



86   I felt fine.



87   then I took a bath and went back to
88   bed.

1   she writes
2   continually
3   like a long nozzle
4   spraying
5   the air,
6   and she argues
7   continually;
8   there is nothing
9   I can say
10   that is really not
11   something else,
12   so,
13   I stop saying;
14   and finally
15   she argues herself
16   out the door
17   saying
18   something like---
19   I'm not /trying/ to
20   impress myself
21   upon you.



22   but I know
23   she will be
24   back, they always
25   come back.



26   and
27   at 5 p.m.
28   she was knocking at the door.



29   I let her in.



30   I won't stay long, she said,
31   if you don't want me.

[Page 122 ]





32   it's all right, I said,
33   I've got to take a
34   bath.



35   she walked into the kitchen and
36   began on the
37   dishes.



38   it's like being married:
39   you accept
40   everything
41   as if
42   it hadn't happened.

        Drowning in Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black
        Sparrow Press ]



1   I used to hold my social security card
2   up in the air,
3   he told me,
4   but I was so small
5   they couldn't see it,
6   all those big
7   guys around.



8   you mean the place with the
9   big green screen?
10   I asked.



11   yeah. well, anyhow, I finally got on
12   the other day
13   picking tomatoes, and Jesus Christ,
14   I couldn't get anywhere
15   it was too hot, too hot
16   and I couldn't get anything in my sack
17   so I lay under the truck
18   in the shade and drank
19   wine. I didn't make a
20   dime.



21   have a drink, I said.



22   sure, he said.



23   two big women came in and
24   I mean BIG
25   and they sat next to
26   us.



27   shot of red-eye, one of them
28   said to the bartender.

[Page 124 ]




29   likewise, said the other.



30   they pulled their dresses up
31   around their hips and
32   swung their legs.



33   um, umm. I think I'm going mad, I told
34   my friend from the tomato fields.



35   Jesus, he said, Jesus and Mary, I can't
36   believe what I see.



37   it's all
38   there, I said.



39   you a fighter? the one next to me
40   asked.



41   no, I said.



42   what happened to your
43   face?



44   automobile accident on the San Berdoo
45   freeway. some drunk jumped the divider. I was
46   the drunk.



47   how old /are/ you, daddy?



48   old enough to slice the melon, I said,
49   tapping my cigar ashes into my beer to give me
50   strength.

[Page 125 ]





51   can you buy a melon? she asked.



52   have you ever been chased across the Mojave and
53   raped?



54   no, she said.



55   I pulled out my last 20 and with an old man's
56   virile abandon ordered
57   four drinks.



58   both girls smiled and pulled their dresses
59   higher, if that was possible.



60   who's your friend? they asked.



61   this is Lord Chesterfield, I told them.



62   pleased ta meetcha, they
63   said.



64   hello, bitches, he answered.



65   we walked through the 3rd street tunnel
66   to a green hotel. the girls had a
67   key.



68   there was one bed and we all got
69   in. I don't know who got
70   who.

[Page 126 ]




71   the next morning my friend and I
72   were down at the Farm Labor Market
73   on San Pedro Street
74   holding up and waving our social
75   security cards.



76   they couldn't see
77   his.



78   I was the last one on the truck out. a big woman stood
79   up against me. she smelled like
80   port wine.



81   honey, she asked, whatever happened to your
82   face?



83   fair grounds, a dancing bear who
84   didn't.



85   bullshit, she said.



86   maybe so, I said, but get your hand out
87   from around my
88   balls. everybody's looking.



89   when we got to the
90   fields the sun was
91   really up
92   and the world
93   looked
94   terrible.

1   I met a genius on the train
2   today
3   about 6 years old,
4   he sat beside me
5   and as the train
6   ran down along the coast
7   we came to the ocean
8   and then he looked at me
9   and said,
10   it's not pretty.



11   it was the first time I'd
12   realized
13   that.

        Bukowski, Charles :  poverty [from Burning in Water Drowning in
        Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   it is the man you've never seen who
2   keeps you going,
3   the one who might arrive
4   someday.



5   he isn't out on the streets or
6   in the buildings or in the
7   stadiums,
8   or if he's there
9   I've missed him somehow.



10   he isn't one of our presidents
11   or statesmen or actors.



12   I wonder if he's there.



13   I walk down the streets
14   past drugstores and hospitals and
15   theatres and cafes
16   and I wonder if he is there.



17   I have looked almost half a century
18   and he has not been seen.



19   a living man, truly alive,
20   say when he brings his hands down
21   from lighting a cigarette
22   you see his eyes
23   like the eyes of a tiger staring past
24   into the wind.



25   but when the hands come down
26   it is always the
27   other eyes

[Page 129 ]


28   that are there
29   always always.



30   and soon it will be too late for me
31   and I will have lived a life
32   with drugstores, cats, sheets, saliva,
33   newspapers, women, doors and other assortments,
34   but nowhere
35   a living man.

        Black Sparrow Press ]



1   kool enough to die but not
2   kill I take my doctor's green
3   pill
4   drink tea
5   as the sharks swim through vases of
6   flowers
7   ten times around they go
8   twenty
9   searching for my sissy
10   heart
11   in a freak May night in
12   Los Angeles
13   Sunday
14   somebody playing
15   Beethoven



16   I sit behind pulled shades
17   in ambush
18   as ambitious men with new automobiles and
19   new blondes
20   command the streets
21   I sit in a rented room
22   carving a wooden rifle
23   drawing pictures of naked ladies
24   bulls
25   love affairs
26   old men
27   on the walls with children's
28   crayons
29   it is up to each of us to live in
30   whatever way we can
31   as the generals, doctors, policemen
32   warn and torture
33   us



34   I bathe once a day
35   am frightened by cats and
36   shadows
37   sleep hardly at all

[Page 131 ]


38   when my heart stops
39   the whole world will get quicker
40   better
41   warmer
42   summer will follow summer
43   the air will be lake clear
44   and the meaning
45   too



46   but meanwhile
47   the green pill
48   these greasy floors off the
49   avenue and
50   down there a plot of worms of worms of
51   worms
52   and up here
53   no nymph blonde
54   to love me to sleep while I am
55   waiting.

        [from Burning in Water Drowning in Flame: Selected Poems
        1955-1973 (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   it's unfortunate, and simply not the style, but I don't care:
2   girls remind me of hair in the sink, girls remind me of intestines
3   and bladders and excretory movements; it's unfortunate also that
4   ice-cream bells, babies, engine-valves, plagiostomes, palm trees,
5   footsteps in the hall ... all excite me with the cold calmness
6   of the gravestone; nowhere, perhaps, is there sanctuary except
7   in hearing that there were other desperate men:
8   Dillinger, Rimbaud, Villon, Babyface Nelson, Seneca, Van Gogh,
9   or desperate women: lady wrestlers, nurses, waitresses, whores
10   poetesses ... although,
11   I do suppose the breaking out of ice-cubes is important
12   or a mouse nosing an empty beercan---
13   two hollow emptinesses looking into each other,
14   or the nightsea stuck with soiled ships
15   that enter the chary web of your brain with their lights,
16   with their salty lights
17   that touch you and leave you
18   for the more solid love of some India;
19   or driving great distances without reason
20   sleep-drugged through open windows that
21   tear and flap your shirt like a frightened bird,
22   and always the stoplights, always red,
23   nightfire and defeat, defeat ...
24   scorpions, scraps, fardels:
25   x-jobs, x-wives, x-faces, x-lives,
26   Beethoven in his grave as dead as a beet;
27   red wheel-barrows, yes, perhaps,
28   or a letter from Hell signed by the devil
29   or two good boys beating the guts out of each other
30   in some cheap stadium full of screaming smoke,
31   but mostly, I don't care, sitting here
32   with a mouthful of rotten teeth,
33   sitting here reading Herrick and Spenser and
34   Marvell and Hopkins and Bronte (Emily, today);
35   and listening to the Dvorak /Midday Witch/
36   or Franck's /Le Chasseur Maudit,/
37   actually I don't care, and it's unfortunate:
38   I have been getting letters from a young poet
39   (very young, it seems) telling me that some day
40   I will most surely be recognized as
41   one of the world's great poets, /Poet!/

[Page 133 ]


42   a malversation: today I walked in the sun and streets
43   of this city: seeing nothing, learning nothing, being
44   nothing, and coming back to my room
45   I passed an old woman who smiled a horrible smile;
46   she was already dead, and everywhere I remembered wires:
47   telephone wires, electric wires, wires for electric faces
48   trapped like goldfish in the glass and smiling,
49   and the birds were gone, none of the birds wanted wire
50   or the smiling of wire
51   and I closed my door (at last)
52   but through the windows it was the same:
53   a horn honked, somebody laughed, a toilet flushed,
54   and oddly then
55   I thought of all the horses with numbers
56   that have gone by in the screaming,
57   gone by like Socrates, gone by like Lorca,
58   like Chatterton ...
59   I'd rather imagine our death will not matter too much
60   except as a matter of disposal, a problem,
61   like dumping the garbage,
62   and although I have saved the young poet's letters,
63   I do not believe them
64   but like at the
65   diseased palm trees
66   and the end of the sun,
67   I sometimes look.

        Sparrow Press ]



1   in the Valkerie Mountains
2   among the strutting peacocks
3   I found a flower
4   as large as my
5   head
6   and when I reached in to smell
7   it


8   I lost an ear lobe
9   part of my nose
10   one eye
11   and half a pack of
12   cigarettes.



13   I came back
14   the next day
15   to hack the damned thing
16   down
17   but found it so
18   beautiful I
19   killed a
20   peacock
21   instead.

        Drowning in Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black
        Sparrow Press ]


1   I walked off the job again
2   and the police stopped me
3   for running a red light at Serrano Ave.
4   my mind was rather gone
5   and I stood in a patch of leaves
6   ankle-deep
7   and kept my head turned
8   so they couldn't smell the liquor
9   too much
10   and I took the ticket and went to my room
11   and got a good symphony on the radio,
12   one of the Russians or Germans,
13   one of the dark tough boys
14   but still I felt lonely and cold
15   and kept lighting cigarettes
16   and I turned on the heater
17   and then down on the floor
18   I saw a magazine with my photo
19   on the cover
20   and I walked over and picked it up
21   but it wasn't me
22   because yesterday is gone
23   and today is only catsup
24   and racing hounds
25   and sickness
26   and women some women
27   momentarily as beautiful
28   as any of the cathedrals,
29   and now they play Bartok
30   who knew what he was doing
31   which meant he didn't know what he was doing,
32   and tomorrow I suppose I will go back
33   to the fucking job
34   like a man to a wife with four kids
35   if they'll have me
36   but today I know that I have gotten out of
37   some kind of net,
38   30 seconds more and I would have been dead,
39   and it is important to recognize
40   one should recognize
41   that type of moment

[Page 136 ]


42   if he wants to continue
43   to avail the gut and the sacked skull of a
44   flower a mountain a ship a woman
45   the code of the frost and the stone
46   everything lapsing into a sense of moment
47   that cleans like the best damn soap on the market
48   and brings Paris, Spain, the groans of Hemingway,
49   the blue madonna, the new-born bull,
50   a night in a closet with red paint
51   right down in on you,
52   and I hope to pay the ticket
53   even though I did not (I think) run the red light
54   but
55   they said I did.

        Bukowski, Charles :  a little sleep and peace of stillness [from
        Burning in Water Drowning in Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973
        (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   if you're a man, Los Angeles is where you hang it up and
2   battle; or if you're a woman, and you've got enough leg and
3   the rest, you sail it against a mountain backdrop so
4   when you grow grey you can hide in Beverly Hills
5   in a mansion so nobody can see how you've decayed.
6   so we moved here---and what do we come up against
7   except a religious maniac in the next shack who
8   drinks cheap wine and has visions and plays his radio
9   as loudly as possible, my god!
10   I know all the spirituals now!
11   I know how very much I have sinned and I realize I must die
12   and I've got to get ready ...
13   but I could use a little sleep first
14   just a little sleep and peace of silence.



15   I open the window and there he is
16   out on the lawn
17   dancing to a hymn
18   a spiritual
19   a whatever.
20   he has on a pair of red bathing trunks
21   he's well-tanned and drunk on wine
22   but his movements are hard and awkward---
23   he's too fat
24   a walnut-like man, distorted and shapeless at
25   55.
26   and he waves his arms in the sun and the birds fly up
27   frightened
28   and then he whirls back into his doorway.



29   but the view from the street here is good---
30   there are Japanese and old women and young girls and
31   beggars.
32   we have large palms
33   plenty of birds
34   and the parking's not bad ...
35   but our religious maniac does not work
36   he's too clever to work
37   and so we both lie around

[Page 138 ]


38   listen to his radio
39   drink
40   and I wonder which of us will get to hell first---
41   him with his bible or me with my Racing Form
42   but if I've got to hear him down there I know I'm going to have to
43   have some help, and the next dance will be mine.



44   right now I wish I had something to sell so I could hide in a
45   place
46   with walls twelve feet high
47   with moats
48   and high-yellow mamas.
49   but it looks like some long days and nights ahead,
50   as always.
51   at the least I can only hope for the weakening of a
52   radio tube,
53   and at the most for his death,
54   which we are both praying and
55   ready for.

        Bukowski, Charles :  he even looked like a nice guy [from
        Burning in Water Drowning in Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973
        (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   he packaged it up neatly in different sections
2   sending the legs to an aunt in St. Louis
3   the head to a scoutmaster in Brooklyn
4   the belly to a cross-eyed butcher in Des Moines,
5   the female organs were sent to a young priest in Los Angeles;
6   the arms he threw to his dog
7   and he kept the hands to use as nut-crackers, and all the
8   leftover and assorted parts
9   like breasts and buttocks he boiled into a soup
10   which strangely
11   tasted better than she ever had.



12   he spent the money in her purse
13   he bought good French wine, frijoles, a pound of grass
14   and two parakeets; he bought the collected works of
15   Keats, a 5 foot square red bandana, a scissors with
16   ivory handles, and a box of candy for his
17   landlady.



18   then he drank and ate and slept for three days and nights
19   and when the police came
20   he seemed very friendly and calm
21   and all the way to the station house
22   he talked of the weather, the color of the mountains,
23   various things like that, he didn't seem like that kind of killer
24   at all.



25   it was very strange.

        Bukowski, Charles :  children in the sky [from Burning in Water
        Drowning in Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black
        Sparrow Press ]



1   the boys come up
2   the boys climb up the
3   brown pole
4   as the waterheater gurgles
5   in Spanish
6   the boys climb the
7   brown pole---


8   Charlemagne fought for this
9   /Il Duce/ was tilted from his car
10   skinned like a bear
11   and hung
12   upsidedown
13   for this---


14   the boys climb up
15   the brown pole
16   3 or 4 of
17   them;
18   we have just moved in
19   this building,
20   the paintings still
21   unpacked, the letters from
22   England and Chicago and
23   Cheyenne and
24   New Orleans,
25   but the beer's on
26   and there are 5 oranges
27   and 4 pears on the table
28   so life's not
29   bad
30   except somebody wanted
31   $15 to
32   turn on the gas;
33   the boys climb the phonepole
34   to leap onto the
35   bluegreen
36   garage roofs
37   and I stand naked
38   behind a curtain,
39   smoking a cigar,

[Page 141 ]


40   and impressed
41   impressed as I can be
42   as if
43   the Virgin Mary
44   was dancing
45   outside;
46   and through the window
47   to the North
48   I can see 2 men
49   feeding
50   45 pigeons
51   and the pigeons
52   walk in separate circles
53   of 8 or 10
54   as if tied together
55   by a revolving string,
56   and it is 3 o'clock
57   in the afternoon and
58   a good cigar.



59   Cicero fought for this,
60   Jake LaMotta and
61   Waslaw Nijinsky,
62   but somebody stole
63   our guitar
64   and I haven't taken my
65   vitamins
66   for weeks.



67   the boys run on the
68   greenblue roofs
69   as to the North the
70   pigeons rise;
71   it is desperately
72   holy
73   and I blow out
74   grey and quiet
75   smoke.

[Page 142 ]




76   then a woman in a red coat,
77   evidently an official,
78   some matron of
79   learning
80   decides that
81   the sky needs
82   cleaning:



83   /Hey ! ! !/ you boys get
84   DOWN
85   from there!



86   it is beautiful as
87   deer
88   running from the
89   hunter.



90   Agrippina fought for this,
91   even Mithridates,
92   even William Hazlitt.



93   there is nothing to do
94   now
95   but unpack.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the weather is hot on the back of my watch
        [from Burning in Water Drowning in Flame: Selected Poems
        1955-1973 (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the weather is hot on the back of my watch
2   which is down at Finkelstein's
3   who is gifted with 3 balls
4   but no heart, but you've got to understand
5   when the bull goes down
6   or the whore, the heart is laid aside for something else,
7   and let's not over-rate obvious decency
8   for in a crap game you may be cutting down
9   some wobbly king of 6 kids
10   and a hemorrhoid butt on his last unemployment check,
11   and who is to say the rose is greater than the thorn?
12   not I, Henry,
13   and when your love gets flabby knees and prefers flat shoes,
14   maybe you should have stuck it into something else
15   like an oil well
16   or a herd of cows.
17   I'm too old to argue,
18   I've gone with the poem
19   and been k.o.'d with the old sucker-punch
20   round after round,
21   but sometimes I like to think of the Kaiser
22   or any other fool full of medals and nothing else,
23   or the first time we read Dos
24   or Eliot with his trousers rolled;
25   the weather is hot on the back of my watch
26   which is down at Finkelstein's,
27   but you know what they say: things are tough all over,
28   and I remember once on the bum in Texas
29   I watched a crow-blast, one hundred farmers with one hundred
30   shotguns
31   jerking off the sky with a giant penis of hate
32   and the crows came down half-dead, half-living,
33   and they clubbed them to death to save their shells
34   but they ran out of shells before they ran out of crows
35   and the crows came back and walked around the pellets and
36   stuck out their tongues
37   and mourned their dead and elected new leaders
38   and then all at once flew home to fuck to fill the gap.



39   you can only kill what shouldn't be there,

[Page 144 ]


40   and Finkelstein should be there and my watch
41   and maybe myself, and I realize that if the poems are bad
42   they are supposed to be bad and if they are good
43   they are likewise supposed to be---although there is a minor
44   fight to be fought,
45   but still I am sad
46   because I was in this small town somewhere in the badlands,
47   way off course, not even wanting to be there,
48   two dollars in my wallet, and a farmer turned to me
49   and asked me what time it was
50   and I wouldn't tell him,
51   and later they gathered them up for burning
52   as if they were no better than dung with feathers,
53   feathers and a little gasoline,
54   and from the bottom of one pile
55   a not-quite-dead crow smiled at me.



56   it was 4:35 p.m.

        Bukowski, Charles :  note to a lady who expected rupert brooke
        [from Burning in Water Drowning in Flame: Selected Poems
        1955-1973 (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   wha', what /did/ you expect? a schoolboy lisping Donne? or
2   some more practical lover filling you with the stench of Life?
3   I'm a fool and no gentleman: I walked the Brooklyn Bridge
4   with Crane in pajamas, but suicide fails as you get older:
5   there's less and less to kill.



6   so among the skin and lambchops, the sick neckties of
7   other closets, I scheme schemes round as oranges
8   filled with the music of my crafty mumbling.



9   Brooke? no. I am a monkey with an olive lost in the
10   circus sand of your laughter, circus apes, circus tigers,
11   circus madmen of finance screwing their secretaries before
12   the 5:15 ... and what did /you/ expect?



13   a pink-cheek dribbling Picasso colors on your dry brain?



14   so, the room was blue with the smoke of my boiling, hell,
15   a senseless sea
16   and I fell fingers sotted to the last pinch of your juice,
17   fell through the thorned vines cursing your name,
18   no gentleman
19   no gentleman,
20   kissed-off love like snake-bite,
21   the veranda buzzed with flies, buzzed with flies
22   and lies, and your red mouth screamed,
23   your lamps screamed
24   breaking like overdue bills:



25   DRUNK! DRUNK AGAIN!
26   O, YOU IDIOT!



27   so, Yeats, Keats, teats ... nothing but an apricot!

[Page 146 ]




28   wha', what happened to Spain? my boy Lorca?
29   the revolution? must join the brigade!
30   lemme outa here!

        Bukowski, Charles :  the difference between a bad poet and a
        good one is luck [from Burning in Water Drowning in Flame:
        Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   I suppose so.
2   I was living in an attic in Philadelphia
3   it became very hot in the summer and so I stayed in the
4   bars. I didn't have any money and so with what was almost left
5   I put a small ad in the paper and said I was a writer
6   looking for work ...
7   which was a god damned lie; I was a writer
8   looking for a little time and a little food and some
9   attic rent.
10   a couple of days later when I finally came home
11   from somewhere
12   the landlady said, there was somebody looking for
13   you. and I said,
14   there must be some mistake. she said,
15   no, it was a writer and he said he wanted you to help him write
16   a history book.
17   oh, fine, I said, and I knew with that I had another week's
18   rent---I mean, on the cuff---
19   so I sat around drinking wine on credit and watching the
20   hot pigeons
21   suffer and fuck on my hot roof.
22   I turned the radio on real loud
23   drank the wine and wondered how I could make a history book
24   interesting but true.
25   but the bastard never came back,
26   and I had to finally sign on with a railroad track gang
27   going West
28   and they gave us cans of food but no
29   openers
30   and we broke the cans against the seats and sides of
31   railroad cars a hundred years old with dust
32   the food wasn't cooked and the water tasted like
33   candlewick
34   and I leaped off into a clump of brush somewhere in
35   Texas
36   all green with nice-looking houses in the
37   distance
38   I found a park
39   slept all night
40   and then they found me and put me in a cell

[Page 148 ]


41   and they asked me about murders and
42   robberies.
43   they wanted to get a lot of stuff off the books
44   to prove their efficiency
45   but I wasn't /that/ tired
46   and they drove me to the next big town
47   fifty-seven miles away
48   the big one kicked me in the ass
49   and they drove off.
50   but I lucked it:
51   two weeks later I was sitting in the office of the city hall
52   half-asleep in the sun like the big fly on my elbow
53   and now and then she took me down to a meeting of the council
54   and I listened very gravely as if I knew what was happening
55   as if I knew how the funds of a halfass town were being
56   dismantled.
57   later I went to bed and woke up with teethmarks all over
58   me, and I said, Christ, watch it, baby! you might give me
59   cancer! and I'm rewriting the history of the Crimean War!
60   and they all came to her house---
61   all the cowboys, all the cowboys:
62   fat, dull and covered with dust.
63   and we all shook hands.
64   I had on a pair of old bluejeans, and they said
65   oh, you're a writer, eh?
66   and I said: well, some think so.
67   and some still think so ...
68   others, of course, haven't quite wised up yet.
69   two weeks later they
70   ran me out
71   of town.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the curtains are waving and people walk
        through the afternoon here and in Berlin and in New York City
        and in Mexico [from Burning in Water Drowning in Flame: Selected
        Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I wait on life like a pregnancy, put the stethoscope to
2   the gut
3   but all I hear now is
4   the piano slamming its teeth through areas of my
5   brain
6   (somebody in this neighborhood likes
7   Gershwin which is too bad
8   for
9   me)
10   and the woman sits behind me
11   sits there sits there
12   and keeps lighting cigarettes
13   and now the nurses leave the hospital near here
14   and they wear dresses that are naked in the sun
15   to cheer the dead and the dying and the doctors
16   but it does not help
17   me
18   if I could rip them with moans of delight it
19   would neither add or take away
20   anything



21   now now


22   a horn blows a tired
23   summer like a gladiola given up and leaning against a
24   house and
25   the bottles we have emptied would strangle the
26   sensibilities ... of God



27   now I look up and see my face in the mirror:
28   if I could only kill the man who killed the
29   man



30   more than coffeepots and cheroots have done me
31   in more than myself has done me

[Page 150 ]


32   in



33   madness comes like a mouse out of the cupboard and
34   they hand me a photograph of the
35   moon



36   the woman behind me has a daughter who falls in love
37   with men in beards and sandals and berets
38   who smoke pipes and carefully comb their hair and
39   play chess and talk continually of the
40   soul and of Art



41   this is good enough: you've got to love
42   something



43   now the landlord waters outside dripping the
44   plants with false rain
45   Gershwin is finished now it sounds like
46   Greig



47   o, it's all so common and hard! impossible!
48   I do wish somebody would go blackberry
49   wild



50   but no
51   I suppose it will be the
52   same: a beer and then another
53   beer and then another
54   beer
55   maybe then a halfpint of
56   scotch
57   three cigars---smoke smoke yes smoke
58   under the electric sun of night
59   hidden here in these walls with this woman and her
60   life while

[Page 151 ]


61   the police are taking the drunks off the
62   streets



63   I do not know how much longer I can
64   last
65   but I keep thinking
66   ow! my god!
67   the
68   gladiola will straighten hard and
69   full of
70   color like an
71   arrow pointing at the
72   sun
73   Christ will shudder like
74   marmalade
75   my cat will look like Gandhi once
76   looked
77   everything everything
78   even the tiles in the men's room at the
79   Union Station will be
80   true



81   /all those mirrors there/
82   /finally with faces in them/



83   roses
84   forests
85   no more policemen
86   no more
87   me.

1   it is justified
2   all dying is justified
3   all killing all death all
4   passing,
5   nothing is in vain
6   not even the neck
7   of a fly,



8   and a flower

/neighbor/

        Bukowski, Charles :  now [from Burning in Water Drowning in
        Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I had boils the size of tomatoes
2   all over me
3   they stuck a drill into me
4   down at the county hospital,
5   and
6   just as the sun went down
7   everyday
8   there was a man in a nearby ward
9   he'd start hollering for his friend Joe.
10   JOE! he'd holler, OH JOE! JOE! J O E !
11   COME GET ME, JOE!


12   Joe never came by.
13   I've never heard such mournful
14   sounds.


15   Joe was probably working off a
16   piece of ass or
17   attempting to solve a crossword puzzle.


18   I've always said
19   if you want to find out who your friends are
20   go to a madhouse or
21   jail.


22   and if you want to find out where love is not
23   be a perpetual
24   loser.


25   I was very lucky with my boils
26   being drilled and tortured
27   against the backdrop of the Sierra Madre mountains
28   while that sun went down;
29   when that sun went down I knew what /I/ would do
30   when I finally got that drill in my hands
31   like I have it
32   now.

2   these guys
3   grey truck
4   radio playing


5   they are in a hurry


6   it's quite exciting:
7   shirt open
8   bellies hanging out


9   they run out the trash bins
10   roll them out to the fork lift
11   and then the truck grinds it upward
12   with far too much sound ...



13   they had to fill out application forms
14   to get these jobs
15   they are paying for homes and
16   drive late model cars


17   they get drunk on Saturday night


18   now in the Los Angeles sunshine
19   they run back and forth with their trash bins


20   all that trash goes somewhere


21   and they shout to each other


22   then they are all up in the truck
23   driving west toward the sea


24   none of them know
25   that I am alive

        Bukowski, Charles :  zoo [from Burning in Water Drowning in
        Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the elephants are caked with mud and tired
2   and the rhinos don't move
3   the zebras are stupid dead stems
4   and the lions don't roar
5   the lions don't care
6   the vultures are overfed
7   the crocodiles don't move
8   and there was a strange type of monkey,
9   I forget the name,
10   he was on a shelf up there, this male,
11   he topped the female and worked one off,
12   finished,
13   fell on his back and grinned,
14   and I said to my girlfriend,
15   let's go, at last something's happened.


16   back at my place we talked about it.


17   the zoo is a very sad place, I said,
18   taking my clothes off.


19   only those 2 monkeys seemed happy, she said,
20   getting out of her
21   clothes.


22   did you see that look on the male monkey's face?
23   I asked.


24   you look just like that afterwards, she
25   said.



26   later in the mirror I saw
27   a strange type of monkey. and
28   wondered about the giraffes and the
29   rhinos, and the elephants, especially the
30   elephants.


31   we'll have to go to the zoo
32   again.

        Bukowski, Charles :  tv [from Burning in Water Drowning in
        Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   I went to this place to see a movie
2   on tv
3   /Alexander the Great,/
4   and here come the armies
5   ta ta ta
6   horses, spears, knives, swords, shields,
7   men falling ...
8   then turn to a roller derby---
9   here's a girl strangling another,
10   then back to Alexander---
11   a guy jumps out and assassinates Alex's father,
12   Alex kills the guy, Alex is king,
13   back to the roller derby---
14   a man is down across the track and another man rams his head
15   with his skates---
16   and here come the armies
17   they appear to be fighting in a cave, there's smoke and
18   flame, swords,
19   men falling---
20   the Thunderbirds are behind,
21   one girl dives under another girl's ass,
22   throws her into the rail---
23   Alexander stands there listening to a guy who is holding
24   a glass of wine in his hand, and this boy is really telling
25   Alex wherehow, you know, and he turns his back to walk away
26   and Alex spears him---
27   the Thunderbirds are behind, they send out
28   Big John---
29   ta ta ta, here come the armies
30   they are splashing through water
31   through forests, they are going to get it
32   all
33   ta ta ta---
34   Big John didn't make it,
35   the girls are out again now---
36   Alexander is dying
37   Alexander the Great is dying
38   and they pass by his pallet in the open
39   he is dressed in fancy black garb and looks like
40   Richard Burton
41   the boys have their helmets off as they pass

[Page 159 ]


42   and there's Alex's love by the pallet, and then
43   Alex begins to go, some men rush up,
44   one asks, Alex, who do you turn the rule over to?
45   who will rule now?
46   they wait.
47   he says, the strongest, and he dies
48   we are shown the clouds, the heavens,
49   way up there, and---
50   the Thunderbirds pull it out
51   in the last 12 seconds, they win it
52   112 to 110,
53   the crowd is consumed with Joy,
54   mercury bleeds into the light,
55   good night, sweet prince,
56   hail Mary,
57   Jesus Christ, what a
58   night.

1   no


2   we can't we can't win it


3   I've decided we can't win it


4   just for a while we thought we could
5   but that was just for a while


6   now we know we can't win it


7   we can't stand still and win it
8   or run and win it


9   or do right and win it


10   or do wrong and win it


11   somebody else is going to win it


12   that's why somebody else is there and
13   we are here




14   it is terrible to be defeated
15   in what seems to count


16   it will happen


17   to accept it is impossible


18   to know it is more important
19   than doves or switchbrakes or
20   love.

        Bukowski, Charles :  hot [from Burning in Water Drowning in
        Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   she was hot, she was so hot
2   I didn't want anybody else to have her,
3   and if I didn't get home on time
4   she'd be gone, and I couldn't bear that---
5   I'd go mad ...
6   it was foolish I know, childish,
7   but I was caught in it, I was caught.


8   I delivered all the mail
9   and then Henderson put me on the night pickup run
10   in an old army truck,
11   the damn thing began to heat halfway through the run
12   and the night went on
13   me thinking about my hot Miriam
14   and jumping in and out of the truck
15   filling mailsacks
16   the engine continuing to heat up
17   the temperature needle was at the top
18   HOT HOT
19   like Miriam.


20   I leaped in and out
21   3 more pickups and into the station
22   I'd be, my car
23   waiting to get me to Miriam who sat on my blue couch
24   with scotch on the rocks
25   crossing her legs and swinging her ankles
26   like she did,
27   2 more stops ...
28   the truck stalled at a traffic light, it was hell
29   kicking it over
30   again ...
31   I had to be home by 8, 8 was the deadline for Miriam.


32   I made the last pickup and the truck stalled at a signal
33   1/2 block from the station ...
34   it wouldn't start, it couldn't start ...
35   I locked the doors, pulled the key and ran down to the
36   station ...
37   I threw the keys down.... signed out ...
38   your god damned truck is stalled at the signal,

[Page 162 ]


39   I shouted,
40   Pico and Western ...


41   ... I ran down the hall, put the key into the door,
42   opened it.... her drinking glass was there, and a note:



43   /sun of a bitch:/
44   /I wated until 5 after ate/
45   /you don't love me/
46   /you sun of a bitch/
47   /somebody will love me/
48   /I been wateing all day/


49   /Miriam/



50   I poured a drink and let the water run into the tub
51   there were 5,000 bars in town
52   and I'd make 25 of them
53   looking for Miriam


54   her purple teddy bear held the note
55   as he leaned against a pillow


56   I gave the bear a drink, myself a drink
57   and got into the hot
58   water.

        Bukowski, Charles :  love [from Burning in Water Drowning in
        Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   love, he said, gas
2   kiss me off
3   kiss my lips
4   kiss my hair
5   my fingers
6   my eyes my brain
7   make me forget


8   love, he said, gas
9   he had a room on the 3rd floor,
10   rejected by a dozen women
11   35 editors
12   and half a dozen hiring agencies,
13   now I'm not saying he was any
14   good


15   he turned on all the jets
16   without lighting them
17   and went to bed


18   some hours later a guy on his
19   way to room 309
20   lit a cigar in the
21   hall


22   and a sofa flew out the window
23   one wall shivered down like wet sand
24   a purple flame waved 40 feet high in the air


25   the guy in bed
26   didn't know or care
27   but I'd have to say
28   he was pretty good
29   that day.

        Sparrow Press ]



1   I used to know a dutchman in a Philly bar
2   he'd take 3 raw eggs in his beer,
3   71, still
4   working,
5   strong,
6   and there I sat down from him
7   4 or 5 barstools away
8   in my 20's
9   frightened
10   suicidal
11   unloved.
12   well, you know, sorrows beget
13   sorrows
14   burn and burn and burn and burn,
15   then something else takes
16   place.
17   I'm not saying it's as good
18   but it's certainly
19   more comfortable,
20   and often nights now
21   I think of that old dutchman---
22   I can look back on almost
23   a lifetime---


24   yet still remember him there
25   my master, then and
26   now.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the way [from Burning in Water Drowning in
        Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   murdered in the alleys of the land
2   frost-bitten against flagpoles
3   pawned by females


4   educated in the dark for the dark


5   vomiting into plugged toilets
6   in rented rooms full of roaches and mice


7   no wonder we seldom sing
8   day or noon or night


9   the useless wars
10   the useless years
11   the useless loves


12   and they ask us,
13   why do you drink so much?


14   well, I suppose the days were made
15   to be wasted
16   the years and the loves were made
17   to be wasted.


18   we can't cry, and it helps to laugh---
19   it's like letting out
20   dreams, ideals,
21   poisons


22   don't ask us to sing,
23   laughing is singing to us,
24   you see, it was a terrible joke


25   Christ should have laughed on the cross,
26   it would have petrified his killers


27   now there are more killers than ever
28   and I write poems for them.

        Bukowski, Charles :  out of the arms ... [from Burning in Water
        Drowning in Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black
        Sparrow Press ]



1   out of the arms of one love
2   and into the arms of another


3   I have been saved from dying on the cross
4   by a lady who smokes pot
5   writes songs and stories,
6   and is much kinder than the last,
7   much much kinder,
8   and the sex is just as good or better.


9   it isn't pleasant to be put on the cross and left there,
10   it is much more pleasant to forget a love which didn't
11   work
12   as all love
13   finally
14   doesn't work ...


15   it is much more pleasant to make love
16   along the shore in Del Mar
17   in room 42, and afterwards
18   sitting up in bed
19   drinking good wine, talking and touching
20   smoking


21   listening to the waves ...


22   I have died too many times
23   believing and waiting, waiting
24   in a room
25   staring at a cracked ceiling
26   waiting for the phone, a letter, a knock, a sound ...
27   going wild inside
28   while she danced with strangers in nightclubs ...


29   out of the arms of one love
30   and into the arms of another


31   it's not pleasant to die on the cross,
32   it's much more pleasant to hear your name whispered in
33   the dark.

        Drowning in Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black
        Sparrow Press ]



1   he spoke to mice and sparrows
2   and his hair was white at the age of 16.
3   his father beat him every day and his mother
4   lit candles in the church.
5   his grandmother came while the boy slept
6   and prayed for the devil to let loose his hold upon
7   him
8   while his mother listened and cried over the
9   bible.


10   he didn't seem to notice young girls
11   he didn't seem to notice the games boys played
12   there wasn't much he seemed to notice
13   he just didn't seem interested.


14   he had a very large, ugly mouth and the teeth
15   stuck out
16   and his eyes were small and lusterless.
17   his shoulders were slumped and his back was bent
18   like an old man's.


19   he lived in our neighborhood.
20   we talked about him when we got bored and then
21   went on to more interesting things.
22   he seldom left his house. we would have liked to
23   torture him
24   but his father
25   who was a huge and terrible man
26   tortured him for
27   us.


28   one day the boy died. at 17 he was still a
29   boy. a death in a small neighborhood is noted with
30   alacrity, and then forgotten 3 or 4 days
31   later.


32   but the death of this boy seemed to stay with us
33   all. we kept talking about it
34   in our boy-men's voices
35   at 6 p.m. just before dark
36   just before dinner.

[Page 168 ]




37   and whenever I drive through that neighborhood now
38   decades later
39   I still think of his death
40   while having forgotten all the other deaths
41   and everything else that happened
42   then.

1   the soldiers march without guns
2   the graves are empty
3   peacocks glide in the rain


4   down stairways march great men smiling


5   there is food enough and rent enough and
6   time enough


7   our women will not grow old


8   I will not grow old


9   bums wear diamonds on their fingers


10   Hitler shakes hands with a Jew


11   the sky smells of roasted flesh


12   I am a burning curtain


13   I am steaming water


14   I am a snake I am an edge of glass that cuts
15   I am blood


16   I am this fiery snail
17   crawling home.

        Bukowski, Charles :  hey, dolly [from Burning in Water Drowning
        in Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   she left me 5 weeks ago and went to Utah.
2   that is, I think she left.
3   the other day I went out to mail her a letter
4   and I saw her sitting on the bus stop bench,
5   it was her hair there
6   from behind
7   and all the pounding started in me again
8   I walked up quickly and looked at the face---
9   it was somebody else. freckles, pugnose, greeneyes,
10   nothing, nothing.


11   then I was on Western Avenue going from bar to bar
12   and I saw her in front of me again.
13   I saw those tight pants, I knew that ass,
14   and there was the hair again,
15   and the way she walked,
16   I walked faster to catch her,
17   I got even with her and saw her face---
18   an Indian's nose, blue eyes, a mouth like a frog---
19   nothing, nothing, nothing.


20   then there was a girl in a bar playing piano.
21   it wasn't her but when the hair fell in a certain way,
22   for a moment, it was. and the hair was the same length
23   and the lips were similar but not the same, and
24   she saw me looking while she was singing, I was drunk,
25   of course, it helped the delusion, and she
26   said, is there anything special you want to hear?
27   Dolly, I said, and she sang---


28   /Hey, Dolly/ ...


29   just now I looked up and she was across the street.
30   she walked out of the apartment across the street
31   with a young blond man and she stood there in sun glasses,
32   and I thought, what's she doing across the street in
33   sun glasses, and she smiled at me through the window
34   but she didn't wave and then she got in the car with the
35   young man, it was a new car, small and red, expensive,
36   and they drove away toward the west. I'm sure it was
37   her, this time.

        Drowning in Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black
        Sparrow Press ]



1   you came out, she said,
2   and then you kicked this guy's car
3   and then you threw yourself into a bush
4   you crushed the whole
5   bush,
6   I don't know what your agony is all
7   about
8   but don't you think you should see a shrink?
9   I've got an awful good shrink, you'd
10   like him.


11   answer me, she said,
12   I get worried about the police when you
13   act like that, I'm very paranoid about the
14   police.


15   answer me, she said, why do you
16   act like that?


17   listen, she said, do you want me to
18   leave?



19   after she left I picked up a chair and
20   threw it out the window. there was much
21   glass and the screen was broken
22   too.


23   how many dead beasts float and walk from Wales to
24   Los Angeles?

        Sparrow Press ]


1   it was Philly and the bartender said
2   what and I said, gimme a draft, Jim,
3   got to get the nerves straight, I'm
4   going to look for a job. you, he said,
5   a job?
6   yeah, Jim, I saw something in the paper,
7   no experience necessary.
8   and he said, hell, you don't want a job,
9   and I said, hell no, but I need money,
10   and I finished the beer
11   and got on the bus and I watched the numbers
12   and soon the numbers got closer
13   and then I was right there
14   and I pulled the cord and the bus stopped and
15   I got off.
16   it was a large building made of tin
17   the sliding door was stuck in the dirt
18   I pulled it back and went in
19   and there wasn't any floor, just more ground,
20   lumpy, wet, and it stank
21   and there were sounds like things being sawed in half
22   and things drilled and it was dark
23   and men walked on girders overhead
24   and men pushed trucks across the ground
25   and men sat at machines doing things
26   and there were shots of lightning and thunder
27   and suddenly a bucket full of flame came swinging at
28   my head, it roared and boiled with flame
29   it hung from a loose chain and it came right at me
30   and somebody hollered, HEY, LOOK OUT!
31   and I just ducked under the bucket
32   feeling the heat go over me,
33   and somebody asked,
34   WHAT DO YOU WANT?
35   and I said, WHERE IS YOUR NEAREST CRAPPER?
36   and I was told
37   and I went inside
38   then came out and saw silhouettes of men
39   moving through flame and sound and
40   I walked to the door, got outside, and
41   took the bus back to the bar and sat down

[Page 173 ]


42   and ordered another draft, and Jim asked,
43   what happened? I said, they didn't want me, Jim.
44   then this whore came in and sat down and everybody
45   looked at her, she looked fine, and I remember it
46   was the first time in my life I almost wished I had a
47   vagina and clit instead of what I had, but in 2 or 3 days
48   I got over that and I was reading the
49   want ads again.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the 8 count [from Burning in Water Drowning

1   this one
2   always arrives at the wrong time


3   a basically good sort
4   I suppose
5   an honest man


6   but he doesn't take the 8 count
7   well


8   we're all beaten
9   but somehow
10   it's the manner in which he takes the count


11   after a visit from him
12   I am sickened for 3 or 4 days


13   I give him board and shelter and sometimes
14   money


15   but how he snarls and bitches
16   sucking at my cans of beer


17   if he expects deliverance in return for what he gives
18   he isn't going to get deliverance
19   because he doesn't give anything


20   no light
21   no love
22   no laughter no learning
23   nothing to
24   remember


25   the way of this one sickens me
26   he brings me sorrow when I have sorrow
27   he brings me madness when I have madness


28   I am a selfish man


29   over his last sweaty handshake
30   I told him I could carry him no longer

[Page 175 ]


31   now when my soul has to puke
32   it will puke of its own

2   he snarls and scratches
3   chases cars
4   groans in his sleep
5   and has a perfect star above each eyebrow


6   we hear it outside:
7   he's ripping the shit out of something out there
8   5 times his
9   size


10   it's the professor's dog from across the street
11   that educated expensive bluebook dog
12   o, we're all in trouble


13   I pull them apart
14   and we run inside with the runt
15   bolt the door
16   flick out the lights
17   and see them crossing the street
18   immaculate and concerned


19   it looks like 7 or 8 people
20   coming to get their
21   dog


22   that big bag of jelly with hair
23   he ought to know better than to cross

1   she sits on the floor
2   going through a cardboard box
3   reading me love letters I have written her
4   while her 4 year old daughter lies on the floor
5   wrapped in a pink blanket and
6   three-quarters asleep


7   we have gotten together after a split
8   I sit in her house on a
9   Sunday night


10   the cars go up and down the hill outside
11   when we sleep together tonight
12   we will hear the crickets


13   where are the fools who don't live as
14   well as I?


15   I love her walls
16   I love her children
17   I love her dog


18   we will listen to the crickets
19   my arm curled about her hip
20   my fingers against her belly


21   one night like this beats life,
22   the overflow takes care of death


23   I like my love letters
24   they are true


25   ah, she has such a beautiful ass!
26   ah, she has such a beautiful soul!

6   when God created the monkey He was asleep
7   when He created the giraffe He was drunk
8   when He created narcotics He was high
9   and when He created suicide He was low

12   He was drunk and He was high
13   and He created the mountains and the sea and fire
14   at the same time


15   He made some mistakes
16   but when He created you lying in bed
17   He came all over His Blessed Universe.

        Drowning in Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black
        Sparrow Press ]



1   you know
2   I sat on the same barstool in Philadelphia for
3   5 years


4   I drank canned heat and the cheapest wine
5   I was beaten in alleys by well-fed truck drivers
6   for the amusement of the
7   ladies and gentlemen of the night


8   I won't tell you of my life as a child
9   it's too sickening
10   unreal


11   but what I mean
12   I finally went to see my friend Eddie
13   after 30 years


14   he was still in the same house
15   with the same wife


16   you guessed it:
17   he looked worse than I did


18   he couldn't get out of his chair


19   a cane
20   arthritis


21   what hair he had was
22   white


23   my god, Eddie, I said.


24   I know, he said, I've had it, I
25   can't breathe.


26   then his wife came out. the once slim
27   Eve I used to flirt with.


28   210 pounds
29   squinting at me.

[Page 180 ]




30   my god, Eve, I said.
31   I know, she said.


32   we got drunk together. it was several hours later
33   Eddie said to me,
34   take her to bed, do her some good,
35   I can't do her any good any
36   more.


37   Eve giggled.


38   I can't Eddie, I said, you're my
39   buddy.


40   we drank some more.
41   endless quarts of
42   beer.


43   Eddie began to vomit.
44   Eve brought him a dishpan
45   and he vomited into the
46   dishpan
47   telling me between spasms
48   that we were men
49   real men
50   we knew what it was all about
51   by god
52   these young punks
53   didn't have it.


54   we carried him to bed
55   undressed him
56   and he was soon out,
57   snoring.


58   I said goodbye to Eve.
59   I got out and got into my car
60   and sat there staring at the house.
61   then I drove off.
62   it was all I had left to do.

1   he comes out at 7:30 a.m. every day
2   with 3 peanut butter sandwiches, and
3   there's one can of beer
4   which he floats in the baitbucket.
5   he fishes for hours with a small trout pole
6   three-quarters of the way down the pier.
7   he's 75 years old and the sun doesn't tan him,
8   and no matter how hot it gets
9   the brown and green lumberjack stays on.
10   he catches starfish, baby sharks, and mackerel;
11   he catches them by the dozen,
12   speaks to nobody.
13   sometime during the day
14   he drinks his can of beer.
15   at 6 p.m. he gathers his gear and his catch
16   walks down the pier
17   across several streets
18   where he enters a small Santa Monica apartment
19   goes to the bedroom and opens the evening paper
20   as his wife throws the starfish, the sharks, the mackerel
21   into the garbage


22   he lights his pipe
23   and waits for dinner.

        Bukowski, Charles :  warm asses [from Burning in Water Drowning
        in Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   this Friday night
2   the Mexican girls at the Catholic carnival
3   look especially good
4   their husbands are in the bars
5   and the Mexican girls look young
6   hawk-nosed with cruel strong eyes,
7   asses warm in tight bluejeans
8   they have been taken somehow,
9   their husbands are tired of those warm asses
10   and the young Mexican girls walk with their children,
11   there is real sorrow in their cruel strong eyes,
12   as they remember nights when their handsome men---
13   not now any longer handsome---
14   said such beautiful things to them
15   beautiful things they will never hear again,
16   and under the moon and in the flashing of the
17   carnival lights
18   I see it all and I stand quietly and mourn for them.
19   they see me looking---
20   the old goat is looking at us
21   he's looking at our eyes;
22   they smile at each other, talk, walk off together,
23   laugh, look at me over their shoulders.
24   I walk over to a booth
25   put a dime on number eleven and win a chocolate cake
26   with 13 colored suckers stuck in the
27   top.
28   that's fair enough for an ex-Catholic
29   and an admirer of warm and young and
30   no-longer used
31   mournful Mexican asses.

        Sparrow Press ]



1   they don't make it
2   the beautiful die in flame---
3   suicide pills, rat poison, rope, what-
4   ever ...
5   they rip their arms off,
6   throw themselves out of windows,
7   they pull their eyes from the sockets,
8   reject love
9   reject hate
10   reject, reject.


11   they don't make it
12   the beautiful can't endure,
13   they are the butterflies
14   they are the doves
15   they are the sparrows,
16   they don't make it.


17   one tall shot of flame
18   while the old men play checkers in the park
19   one flame, one good flame
20   while the old men play checkers in the park
21   in the sun.


22   the beautiful are found at the edge of a room
23   crumpled into spiders and needles and silence
24   and we can never understand why they
25   left, they were so
26   beautiful.


27   they don't make it,
28   the beautiful die young
29   and leave the ugly to their ugly lives.


30   lovely and brilliant: life and suicide and death
31   as the old men play checkers in the sun
32   in the park.

1   terrible arguments.
2   and, at last, lying peacefully
3   on her large bed
4   which is
5   spread in red with cool patterns of flowers,
6   my head and belly down
7   head sideways
8   sprayed by shaded light
9   as she bathes quietly in the
10   other room,
11   it is all beyond me,
12   as most things are,
13   I listen to classical music on the small radio,
14   she bathes, I hear the splashing of water.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the catch [from Burning in Water Drowning

1   crud, he said,
2   hauling it out of the water,
3   what is it?


4   a Hollow-Back June Whale, I said.


5   no, said a guy standing by us on the pier,
6   it's a Billow-Wind Sand-Groper.


7   a guy walking by said,
8   it's a Fandango Escadrille without stripes.


9   we took the hook out and the thing stood up and
10   farted. it was grey and covered with hair
11   and fat and it stank like old socks.


12   it began to walk down the pier and we followed it.
13   it ate a hot dog and bun right out of the hands of
14   a little girl. then it leaped on the merry-go-round
15   and rode a pinto. it fell off near the end and
16   rolled in the sawdust.


17   we picked it up.


18   grop, it said, grop.


19   then it walked back out on the pier.
20   a large crowd followed us as we walked along.


21   it's a publicity stunt, said somebody,
22   it's a man in a rubber suit.


23   then as it was walking along it began to breathe
24   very heavily. it fell on its
25   back and began to thrash.


26   somebody poured a cup of beer over its head.


27   grop, it went, grop.


28   then it was dead.

[Page 186 ]




29   we rolled it to the edge of the pier and pushed it
30   back into the water. we watched it sink and vanish.


31   it was a Hollow-Back June Whale, I said.


32   no, said the other guy, it was a Billow-Wind Sand-Groper.


33   no, said the other expert, it was a Fandango Escadrille
34   without stripes.


35   then we all went our way on a mid-afternoon in August.

        Bukowski, Charles :  wax job [from Burning in Water Drowning in
        Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   man, he said, sitting on the steps
2   your car sure needs a wash and wax job
3   I can do it for you for 5 bucks,
4   I got the wax, I got the rags, I got everything
5   I need.


6   I gave him the 5 and went upstairs.
7   when I came down 4 hours later
8   he was sitting on the steps drunk
9   and offered me a can of beer.
10   he said he'd get the car the next
11   day.


12   the next day he got drunk again and
13   I loaned him a dollar for a bottle of
14   wine. his name was Mike
15   a world war II veteran.
16   his wife worked as a nurse.


17   the next day I came down and he was sitting
18   on the steps and he said,
19   you know, I been sitting here looking at your car,
20   wondering just how I was gonna do it,
21   I wanna do it real good.


22   the next day Mike said it looked like rain
23   and it sure as hell wouldn't make any sense
24   to wash and wax a car when it was gonna rain.


25   the next day it looked like rain again.
26   and the next.
27   then I didn't see him anymore.
28   a week later I saw his wife and she said,
29   they took Mike to the hospital,
30   he's all swelled-up, they say it's from the
31   drinking.


32   listen, I told her, he said he was going to wax my
33   car, I gave him 5 dollars to wax my
34   car.

[Page 188 ]


35   he's in the critical ward, she said,
36   he might die ...



37   I was sitting in their kitchen
38   drinking with his wife
39   when the phone rang.
40   she handed the phone to me.
41   it was Mike. listen, he said, come on down and
42   get me, I can't stand this
43   place.


44   I drove on down there, walked into the
45   hospital, walked up to his bed and
46   said, let's go Mike.


47   they wouldn't give him his clothes
48   so Mike walked to the elevator in his
49   gown.


50   we got on and there was a kid driving the
51   elevator and eating a popsicle.
52   nobody's allowed to leave here in a gown,
53   he said.


54   you just drive this thing, kid, I said,
55   we'll worry about the gown.


56   Mike was all puffed-up, triple size
57   but I got him into the car somehow
58   and gave him a cigarette.


59   I stopped at the liquor store for 2 six packs
60   then went on in. I drank with Mike and his wife until
61   11 p.m.
62   then went upstairs ...



63   where's Mike? I asked his wife 3 days later,
64   you know he said he was going to wax my car.

[Page 189 ]




65   Mike died, she said, he's gone.


66   you mean he died? I asked.


67   yes, he died, she said.


68   I'm sorry, I said, I'm very sorry


69   it rained for a week after that and I figured the only
70   way I'd get the 5 back was to go to bed with his wife
71   but you know
72   she moved out 2 weeks later



73   an old guy with white hair moved in there
74   and he had one blind eye and played the French Horn.
75   there was no way I could make it with
76   him.

1   some people never go crazy.
2   me, sometimes I'll lie down behind the couch
3   for 3 or 4 days.
4   they'll find me there.
5   it's Cherub, they'll say, and
6   they pour wine down my throat
7   rub my chest
8   sprinkle me with oils.


9   then, I'll rise with a roar,
10   rant, rage---
11   curse them and the universe
12   as I send them scattering over the
13   lawn.
14   I'll feel much better,
15   sit down to toast and eggs,
16   hum a little tune,
17   suddenly become as lovable as a
18   pink
19   overfed whale.


20   some people never go crazy.
21   what truly horrible lives
22   they must lead.

        Black Sparrow Press ]



1   my father was a practical man.
2   he had an idea.
3   you see, my son, he said,
4   I can pay for this house in my lifetime,
5   then it's mine.
6   when I die I pass it on to you.
7   now in your lifetime you can acquire a house
8   and then you'll have two houses
9   and you'll pass those two houses on to your
10   son, and in his lifetime he acquires a house,
11   then when he dies, his son---


12   I get it, I said.


13   my father died while trying to drink a
14   glass of water. I buried him.
15   solid mahogany casket. after the funeral
16   I went to the racetrack, met a high yellow.
17   after the races we went to her apartment
18   for dinner and goodies.


19   I sold his house after about a month.
20   I sold his car and his furniture
21   and gave away all his paintings except one
22   and all his fruit jars
23   (filled with fruit boiled in the heat of summer)
24   and put his dog in the pound.
25   I dated his girlfriend twice
26   but getting nowhere
27   I gave it up.


28   I gambled and drank away the money.


29   now I live in a cheap front court in Hollywood
30   and take out the garbage to
31   hold down the rent.


32   my father was a practical man.
33   he choked on that glass of water
34   and saved on hospital
35   bills.

1   twitching in the sheets---
2   to face the sunlight again,
3   that's clearly
4   trouble.
5   I like the city better when the
6   neon lights are going and
7   the nudies dance on top of the
8   bar
9   to the mauling music.


10   I'm under this sheet
11   thinking.
12   my nerves are hampered by
13   history---
14   the most memorable concern of mankind
15   is the guts it takes to
16   face the sunlight again.


17   love begins at the meeting of two
18   strangers. love for the world is
19   impossible. I'd rather stay in bed
20   and sleep.


21   dizzied by the days and the streets and the years
22   I pull the sheets to my neck.
23   I turn my ass to the wall.
24   I hate the mornings more than
25   any man.

1   there are beasts in the salt shaker
2   and airdromes in the coffeepot.
3   my mother's hand is in the bag drawer
4   and from the backs of spoons come
5   the cries of tiny tortured animals.


6   in the closet stands a murdered man
7   wearing a new green necktie
8   and under the floor,
9   there's a suffocating angel with flaring nostrils.


10   it's hard to live here.
11   it's very hard to live here.


12   at night the shadows are unborn creatures.
13   beneath the bed
14   spiders kill tiny white ideas.


15   the nights are bad
16   the nights are very bad
17   I drink myself to sleep
18   I have to drink myself to sleep.


19   in the morning
20   over breakfast
21   I see them roll the dead down the street
22   (I never read about this in the newspapers).


23   and there are eagles everywhere
24   sitting on the roof, on the lawn, inside my car.
25   the eagles are eyeless and smell of sulphur.
26   it is very discouraging.


27   people visit me
28   sit in chairs across from me
29   and I see them crawling with vermin---
30   green and gold and yellow bugs
31   they do not brush away.


32   I have been living here too long.
33   soon I must go to Omaha.

[Page 194 ]


34   they say that everything is jade there
35   and does not move.
36   they say you can stitch designs in the water
37   and sleep high in olive trees.
38   I wonder if this is
39   true?


40   I can't live here much longer.

1   if you can't stand the heat, he says, get out of the
2   kitchen. you know who said that?
3   Harry Truman.


4   I'm not in the kitchen, I say, I'm in the
5   oven.


6   my editor is a difficult man.
7   I sometimes phone him in moments of doubt.


8   look, he answers, you'll be lighting cigars with ten dollar
9   bills, you'll have a redhead on one arm and a blonde
10   on the other.


11   other times he'll say, look, I think I'm going to hire
12   V.K. as my associate editor. we've got to prune off
13   5 poets here somewhere. I'm going to leave it up
14   to him. (V.K. is a very imaginative poet who believes I've
15   knifed him from N.Y.C. to the shores of Hawaii.)


16   look, kid, I phone my editor, can you speak German?
17   no, he says.
18   well, anyhow, I say, I need some good new tires, cheap.
19   so you know where I can get some good new tires, cheap?
20   I'll phone you in 30 minutes, he says, will you be in
21   in 30 minutes?
22   I can't afford to go anywhere, I say.
23   he says, they say you were drunk at that reading
24   in Oregon.
25   ugly gossips, I answer.


26   were you?


27   I don't
28   remember.


29   one day he phones me:
30   you're not hitting the ball anymore. you /are/ hitting the
31   bottle and fighting with all these
32   women. you know we got a good kid on the bench,
33   he's aching to get in there

[Page 197 ]


34   he hits from both sides of the plate
35   he can catch anything that ain't hit over the wall
36   he's coached by Duncan, Creeley, Wakoski
37   /and/ he can /rhyme,/ he knows
38   images, similes, metaphors, figures, conceits,
39   assonance, alliteration, metrics, yes
40   metrics like, you know---
41   iambic, trochaic, anapestic, spondaic,
42   he knows caesura, denotation, connotation, personification,
43   diction, voice, paradox, rhetoric, tone /and/
44   coalescence ...


45   holy shit, I say, hang up and take a good hit of
46   Old Grandad. Harry's still alive
47   according to the papers. but I decide rather than
48   getting new tires to get
49   a set of retreads instead.

3   had to get it filled


4   he lost his left eye 40 years

7   operate to get the money. I found out
8   later it coulda been
9   saved.


10   ---I take the eye out at night, he says,
11   it hurts. they never did get it right.


12   ---which eye is it, Charles?


13   ---this one here, he points,
14   then excuses himself. he has to get up and
15   go into the
16   kitchen. he's baking cookies in the oven.


17   he comes out soon with a
18   plate.


19   ---try some.


20   I do. they're
21   good.


22   ---want some coffee? he asks.


23   ---no, thanks, Charles, I haven't been sleeping
24   nights.

26   58. 22 years ago. she's in a rest home now.

33   anything from the store, anything like
34   that?


35   ---no, I just went shopping this morning.



36   his back is as straight as the wall and he has the
37   tiniest pot
38   belly. as he talks he
39   keeps his one eye on the tv set.

1   it was up in San Francisco
2   after my poetry reading.
3   it had been a nice crowd
4   I had gotten my money
5   I had this place upstairs
6   there was some drinking
7   and this guy started beating up on a fag
8   I tried to stop him
9   and the guy broke a window
10   deliberately.
11   I told them all to
12   get out
13   and she started hollering down to the guy
14   who had beat on the fag
15   and he kept calling her name back up
16   and then I remembered she had vanished for an hour
17   before the reading.
18   she did those things.
19   maybe not bad things
20   but consistently careless things
21   and I told her we were through
22   and to get out
23   and I went to bed
24   then hours later she walked in
25   and I said, what the hell are you doing here?
26   she was all wild, hair down in her face,
27   you're too callous, I said, I don't want you.
28   it was dark and she leaped at me:
29   I'll kill you, I'll kill you!
30   I was still too drunk to defend myself
31   and she had me down on the kitchen floor
32   and she clawed my face and
33   bit a hole in my arm.


34   then I went back to bed and listened to her heels
35   going down the hill.

        Sparrow Press ]



1   this kid used to teach at Kansas U.
2   then they moved him out
3   he went to a bean factory
4   then he and his wife moved to the coast
5   she got a job and worked while
6   he looked for a job as an actor.
7   I really want to be an actor, he told me,
8   that's all I want to be.
9   he came by with his wife.
10   he came by alone.
11   the streets around here are full of guys who
12   want to be actors.
13   I saw him yesterday.
14   he was rolling cigarettes.
15   I poured him some white wine.
16   my wife is getting tired of waiting, he said,
17   I'm going to teach karate.
18   his hands were swollen from hitting
19   bricks and walls and doors.
20   he told me about some of the great oriental
21   fighters. there was one guy so good
22   he could turn his head 180 degrees
23   to see who was behind him. that's very hard to do,
24   he said.
25   further: it's more difficult to fight 4 men properly placed
26   than to fight many more. when you have many more
27   they get in each other's way, and a good fighter who has
28   strength and agility can do well.
29   some of the great fighters, he said,
30   even suck their balls up into their bodies.
31   this can be done---to some extent---because there are
32   natural cavities in the body.... if you stand upsidedown
33   you will notice this.


34   I gave him a little more white wine,
35   then he left.
36   you know, sometimes making it with a typewriter
37   isn't so painful
38   after all.

1   I was glad I had money in the Savings and Loan
2   Friday afternoon hungover
3   I didn't have a job


4   I was glad I had money in the Savings and Loan
5   I didn't know how to play a guitar
6   Friday afternoon hungover


7   Friday afternoon hungover
8   across the street from Norm's
9   across the street from The Red Fez


10   I was glad I had money in the Savings and Loan
11   split with my girlfriend and blue and demented
12   I was glad to have my passbook and stand in line


13   I watched the buses run up Vermont
14   I was too crazy to get a job as a driver of buses
15   and I didn't even look at the young girls


16   I got dizzy standing in line but I
17   just kept thinking I have money in this building
18   Friday afternoon hungover


19   I didn't know how to play the piano
20   or even hustle a damnfool job in a carwash
21   I was glad I had money in the Savings and Loan


22   finally I was at the window
23   it was my Japanese girl
24   she smiled at me as if I were some amazing god


25   back again, eh? she said and laughed
26   as I showed her my withdrawal slip and my passbook
27   as the buses ran up and down Vermont


28   the camels trotted across the Sahara
29   she gave me the money and I took the money
30   Friday afternoon hungover


31   I walked into the market and got a cart

[Page 203 ]


32   and I threw sausages and eggs and bacon and bread in there
33   I threw beer and salami and relish and pickles and mustard in there


34   I looked at the young housewives wiggling casually
35   I threw t-bone steaks and porterhouse and cube steaks in my cart
36   and tomatoes and cucumbers and oranges in my cart


37   Friday afternoon hungover
38   split with my girlfriend and blue and demented
39   I was glad I had money in the Savings and Loan.

        Sparrow Press ]



1   I got in the shower
2   and burned my balls
3   last Wednesday.


4   met this painter called Spain,
5   no, he was a cartoonist,
6   well, I met him at a party
7   and everybody got mad at me
8   because I didn't know who he was
9   or what he did.


10   he was rather a handsome guy
11   and I guess he was jealous because
12   I was so ugly.
13   they told me his name
14   and he was leaning against the wall
15   looking handsome, and I said:
16   hey, Spain, I like that name: Spain.
17   but I don't like you. why don't we step out
18   in the garden and I'll kick the shit out of your
19   ass?


20   this made the hostess angry
21   and she walked over and rubbed his pecker
22   while I went to the crapper
23   and heaved.


24   but everybody's angry at me.
25   Bukowski, he can't write, he's had it.
26   washed-up. look at him drink.
27   he never used to come to parties.
28   now he comes to parties and drinks everything
29   up and insults real talent.
30   I used to admire him when he cut his wrists
31   and when he tried to kill himself with
32   gas. look at him now leering at that 19 year old
33   girl, and you know he
34   can't get it up.


35   I not only burnt my balls in that shower
36   last Wednesday, I spun around to get out of the burning

1   the rag.
2   she sat there, glooming.
3   I couldn't do anything with her.
4   it was raining.
5   she got up and left.
6   well, hell, here it is again, I thought
7   I picked up my drink and turned the radio up,
8   took the lampshade off the lamp
9   and smoked a cheap black bitter cigar
10   imported from Germany.
11   there was a knock on the door
12   and I opened the door
13   a little man stood in the rain
14   and he said,
15   have you seen a pigeon on your porch?
16   I told him I hadn't seen a pigeon on my porch
17   and he said if I saw a pigeon on my porch
18   to let him know.
19   I closed the door
20   sat down
21   and then a black cat leaped through the
22   window and jumped on my
23   lap and purred, it was a beautiful animal
24   and I took it into the kitchen and we both ate a
25   slice of ham.
26   then I turned off all the lights
27   and went to bed
28   and that black cat went to bed with me
29   and it purred
30   and I thought, well, somebody likes me,
31   then the cat started pissing,
32   it pissed all over me and all over the sheets,
33   the piss rolled across my belly and slid down my sides
34   and I said: hey, what's wrong with you?
35   I picked up the cat and walked him to the door
36   and threw him out into the rain
37   and I thought, that's very strange, that cat
38   pissing on me
39   his piss was cold as the rain.
40   then I phoned her
41   and I said, look, what's wrong with you? have you lost

[Page 207 ]


42   your god damned mind?
43   I hung up and pulled the sheets off the bed
44   and got in and lay there listening to the rain.
45   sometimes a man doesn't know what to do about things
46   and sometimes it's best to lie very still
47   and try not to think at all
48   about anything.


49   that cat belonged to somebody
50   it had a flea collar.
51   I don't know about the
52   woman.

        Bukowski, Charles :  we, the artists--- [from Burning in Water
        Drowning in Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black
        Sparrow Press ]



1   in San Francisco the landlady, 80, helped me drag the green
2   Victrola up the stairway and I played Beethoven's 5th
3   until they beat on the walls.
4   there was a large bucket in the center of the room
5   filled with beer and winebottles;
6   so, it might have been the d.t.'s, one afternoon
7   I heard a sound something like a bell
8   only the bell was humming instead of ringing,
9   and then a golden light appeared in the corner of the room
10   up near the ceiling
11   and through the sound and light
12   shone the face of a woman, worn but beautiful,
13   and she looked down at me
14   and then a man's face appeared by hers,
15   the light became stronger and the man said:
16   we, the artists, are proud of you!
17   then the woman said: the poor boy is frightened,
18   and I was, and then it went away.
19   I got up, dressed, and went to the bar
20   wondering who the artists were and why they should be
21   proud of me. there were some live ones in the bar
22   and I got some free drinks, set my pants on fire with the
23   ashes from my corncob pipe, broke a glass deliberately,
24   was not rousted, met a man who claimed he was William
25   Saroyan, and we drank until a woman came in and
26   pulled him out by the ear and I thought, no, that can't be
27   William, and another guy came in and said: man, you talk
28   tough, well, listen, I just got out for assault and
29   battery, so don't mess with me! we went outside the
30   bar, he was a good boy, he knew how to duke, and it went
31   along fairly even, then they stopped it and we went
32   back in and drank another couple of hours. I walked
33   back up to my place, put on Beethoven's 5th and
34   when they beat on the walls I beat
35   back.


36   I keep thinking of myself young, then, the way I was,
37   and I can hardly believe it but I don't mind it.
38   I hope the artists are still proud of me
39   but they never came back
40   again.

[Page 209 ]


41   the war came running in and next I knew
42   I was in New Orleans
43   walking into a bar drunk
44   after falling down in the mud on a rainy night.
45   I saw one man stab another and I walked over and
46   put a nickle in the juke box.
47   it was a beginning. San
48   Francisco and New Orleans were two of my
49   favorite towns.

        Bukowski, Charles :  i can't stay in the same room with that
        woman for five minutes [from Burning in Water Drowning in Flame:
        Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   I went over the other day
2   to pick up my daughter.
3   her mother came out with workman's
4   overalls on.
5   I gave her the child support money
6   and she laid a sheaf of poems on me by one
7   Manfred Anderson.
8   I read them.
9   he's great, she said.
10   does he send this shit out? I asked.
11   oh no, she said, Manfred wouldn't do that.
12   why?
13   well, I don't know exactly.
14   listen, I said, you know all the poets who
15   don't send their shit out.
16   the magazines aren't ready for them, she said,
17   they're too far advanced for publication.
18   oh for christ's sake, I said, do you really
19   believe that?
20   yes, yes, I really believe that, she
21   answered.
22   look, I said, you don't even have the kid ready
23   yet. she doesn't have her shoes on. can't you
24   put her shoes on?
25   your daughter is 8 years old, she said,
26   she can put her own shoes on.
27   listen, I said to my daughter, for christ's sake
28   will you put your shoes on?
29   Manfred never screams, said her mother.
30   OH HOLY JESUS CHRIST! I yelled
31   you see, you see? she said, you haven't changed.
32   what time is it? I asked.
33   4:30. Manfred did submit some poems once, she said,
34   but they sent them back and he was /terribly/
35   upset.
36   you've got your shoes on, I said to my daughter,
37   let's go.
38   her mother walked to the door with us.
39   have a nice day, she said.
40   fuck off, I said.

[Page 211 ]


41   when she closed the door there was a sign pasted to
42   the outside. it said:
43   SMILE.
44   I didn't.
45   we drove down Pico on the way in.
46   I stopped outside the Red Ox.
47   I'll be right back, I told my daughter.
48   I walked in, sat down, and ordered a scotch and
49   water. over the bar there was a little guy popping in and
50   out of a door holding a very red, curved penis
51   in his hand.
52   can't
53   can't you make him stop? I asked the barkeep.
54   can't you shut that thing off?
55   what's the matter with you, buddy? he asked.
56   I submit my poems to the magazines, I said.
57   you submit your poems to the magazines? he asked.
58   you are god damned right I do, I said.
59   I finished my drink and got back to the car.
60   I drove down Pico Boulevard.
61   the remainder of the day was bound to be better.

        Bukowski, Charles :  charisma [from Burning in Water Drowning in

1   this woman keeps phoning me
2   even though I tell her I am living with a woman
3   I love.


4   I keep hearing noises in the environment,
5   she phones,
6   I thought it was you.


7   me? I haven't been drunk for several
8   days.


9   well, maybe it wasn't you but I felt it was
10   somebody who was trying to help
11   me.


12   maybe it was God. do you think He's there?


13   yes, He's a hook from the ceiling.


14   I thought so.


15   I'm growing tomatoes in my basement,
16   she says.


17   that's sensible.


18   I want to move. where shall I move?


19   north is obvious. west is the ocean. the east is the
20   past. south is the only way.


21   south?


22   yes, but not past the border. it's death to
23   gringos.


24   what's Salinas like? she asks.


25   if you like lettuce
26   go to Salinas.

[Page 213 ]




27   suddenly she hangs up. she always does that. and she
28   always phones back in a day or a week or a
29   month. she'll be at my funeral with tomatoes and the
30   yellow pages of the phonebook stuck into the pockets of
31   her mince-brown overcoat in 97 degree heat,
32   I have a way with the ladies.

        Sparrow Press ]



1   strange warmth, hot and cold females,
2   I make good love, but love isn't just
3   sex. most females I've known are
4   ambitious, and I like to lie around
5   on large comfortable pillows at 3 o'clock
6   in the afternoon, I like to watch the sun
7   through the leaves of a bush outside
8   while the world out there
9   holds away from me, I know it so well, all
10   those dirty pages, and I like to lie around
11   my belly up to the ceiling after making love
12   everything flowing in:
13   it's so easy to be easy---if you let it, that's all
14   that's necessary.
15   but the female is strange, she is very
16   ambitious---shit! I can't sleep away the day!
17   all we do is eat! make love! sleep! eat! make love!


18   my dear, I say, there are men out there now
19   picking tomatoes, lettuce, even cotton,
20   there are men and women dying under the sun,
21   there are men and women dying in factories
22   for nothing, a pittance ...
23   I can hear the sound of human lives being ripped to
24   pieces ...
25   you don't know how lucky we
26   are ...


27   but you've got it made, she says,
28   your poems ...


29   my love gets out of bed.
30   I hear her in the other room.
31   the typewriter is working.


32   I don't know why people think effort and energy
33   have anything to do with
34   creation.


35   I suppose that in matters like politics, medicine,
36   history and religion

[Page 215 ]


37   they are mistaken
38   also.


39   I turn on my belly and fall asleep with my
40   ass to the ceiling for a change.

1   you shoulda been at this party,
2   I know you hate parties
3   but you seem to be at most of them.
4   anyhow, I took my girl, you know
5   her---


6   Java Jane?


7   yes, this party was at the merry-go-round
8   where they are trying to tear the pier down, you
9   know where that is?


10   yes, the red paint, the broken
11   windows---


12   yes, anyhow, my girl lives in a room just above the
13   merry-go-round. it's a
14   birthday party for the woman who owns the
15   merrry-go-round.
16   she's trying to save the pier
17   she's trying to save the merry-go-round---
18   plenty of drinks for everybody, my girl lives in the
19   room right above the
20   merry-go-round.


21   sounds great.


22   I phoned. you weren't
23   in.


24   it's all right.


25   well, there was plenty to drink and they turned the
26   merry-go-round on, it was free, music and
27   everything.


28   sounds great.


29   my girlfriend and I got into an
30   argument, all the drinking---

[Page 217 ]




31   of course.


32   I'm standing apart from her
33   she's standing apart from me.
34   she's got a glass of wine in her hand.
35   I give her a dark green deathly stare,
36   she's stricken
37   she steps back
38   the thing is whirling
39   a horse's hoof kicks her in the ass.
40   she drops down upon the spinning.
41   it all happens so fast---
42   but I do notice
43   that all the time she's circling
44   to the music under those horses
45   she's holding her glass upright
46   in order not to spill a
47   drop.


48   brave.


49   sure. only all the time her panties are
50   showing. glowing and glistening.
51   pink.


52   wonderful. how do they do it?


53   they conspire.


54   the glistening pink?


55   yes. so her panties are showing and I think
56   well, that's all right but it probably looks
57   a hell of a lot better to them than it does to
58   me, so I moved a step forward and said,
59   Jane.


60   what happened?


61   she kept spinning around holding her drink up
62   showing her pink bottom ... there seemed something

[Page 218 ]


63   tenuous about it, deliciously inane ...


64   stunted glory finally comes forth hollering ...


65   exactly. she kept gliding around
66   legs outspread---
67   dizzied with life---
68   vengeful---
69   she must have cared for me to show her
70   panties to all those
71   people. anyhow, she kept sliding around
72   until her leg hit one of this guy's legs---
73   he'd stepped forward for a closer look.
74   he was 67 years old and with his wife
75   and they were both
76   eating spaghetti off paper plates, anyhow,
77   my girl's leg hit his
78   she came bouncing off on her ass
79   still holding the glass of wine upright.
80   I walked over and picked her up
81   and she still held it
82   level, then she lifted it and
83   drank it.


84   sounds like it was a
85   fine party.


86   I phoned. you weren't
87   in.


88   spiderwebs of dripping
89   wet-dew sex like
90   badbreath dreams.


91   exactly. you should have been
92   there.


93   sorry.

1   the kid went back to New York City to live with a woman
2   he met in a kibbutz.
3   he left his mother at the age of
4   32, a well-kept fellow, sense of humor and never
5   wore the same pair of shorts
6   more than one day. there he was
7   in the Puerto Rican section, she had a
8   job. he wanted iron bars on the windows and
9   ate too much fried chicken at 10 a.m.
10   in the morning after she went to
11   work. he had some money saved out of the
12   years and he fucked but he was really
13   afraid of
14   pussy.


15   I was sitting with Eileen in Hollywood
16   and I said:
17   I ought to warn the kid
18   so that when she turns on him
19   he'll be
20   ready.


21   no, she said, let him be happy.


22   I let him be
23   happy.


24   now he's back living with his
25   mother, he weighs three hundred and ten pounds
26   and eats all the time
27   and laughs all the time
28   but you ought to see his
29   eyes ...
30   the eyes are sitting in the center of all that
31   flesh ...


32   he bites into a chicken leg:
33   I loved her, he says to me,
34   I loved her.

1   she was in her orange Volks waiting
2   as I walked up the street
3   with 2 six packs and a pint of scotch
4   and she jumped out
5   and began grabbing the beerbottles and
6   smashing them on the pavement
7   and she got the pint of scotch and
8   smashed that too,

12   stood halfway up the stairs,
13   then /she/ ran in from the street
14   and up the stairs and hit the other woman
15   with her purse, saying:
16   he's my man! he's my man!
17   and then she ran out and
18   jumped into her orange Volks
19   and drove away.
20   I came out with a broom
21   and began sweeping up the glass
22   when I heard a sound
23   and there was the orange Volks
24   running on the sidewalk
25   and on me---
26   I managed to leap up against a wall
27   as it went by.
28   then I took the broom and began sweeping up
29   the glass again,
30   and suddenly she was standing there;
31   she took the broom and broke it into three
32   pieces,
33   then she found an unbroken beerbottle
34   and threw it at the glass window of the door.
35   it made a clean round hole
36   and the other woman shouted down from the
37   stairway: for God's sake, Bukowski, go with
38   her!


39   I got into the orange Volks and we
40   drove off together.

1   each man must realize
2   that it can all disappear very
3   quickly:
4   the cat, the woman, the job,
5   the front tire,
6   the bed, the walls, the
7   room; all our necessities
8   including love,
9   rest on foundations of sand---
10   and any given cause,
11   no matter how unrelated:
12   the death of a boy in Hong Kong
13   or a blizzard in Omaha ...
14   can serve as your undoing.
15   all your chinaware crashing to the
16   kitchen floor, your girl will enter
17   and you'll be standing, drunk,
18   in the center of it and she'll ask:
19   my god, what's the matter?
20   and you'll answer: I don't know,
21   I don't know ...

        (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   the motion of the human heart:
2   strangled over Missouri;
3   sheathed in hot wax in Boston;
4   burned like a potato in Norfolk;
5   lost in the Allegheny Mountains;
6   found again in a 4-poster mahogany bed
7   in New Orleans;
8   drowned and stirred with pinto beans
9   in El Paso;
10   hung on a cross like a drunken dog
11   in Denver;
12   cut in half and toasted in
13   Kalamazoo;
14   found cancerous on a fishing boat
15   off the coast of Mexico;
16   tricked and caged at Daytona Beach;
17   kicked by a nursery maid
18   in a green and white ghingham dress,
19   waiting table at a North Carolina
20   bus stop;
21   rubbed in olive oil and goat-piss
22   by a chess-playing hooker in the East Village;
23   painted red, white, and blue
24   by an act of Congress;
25   torpedoed by a dyed blonde
26   with the biggest ass in Kansas;
27   gutted and gored by a woman
28   with the soul of a bull
29   in East Lansing;
30   petrified by a girl with tiny fingers,
31   she had one tooth missing,
32   upper front, and pumped gas
33   in Mesa;
34   the motion of the human heart goes on
35   and on
36   and on and on
37   for a while.

1   my moustache is pasted-on
2   and my wig and my eyebrows
3   and even my eyes ...
4   then something stuns me ...
5   the lampshades swing, I hear
6   simmering and magic and
7   incredible sounds.


        2.


8   I know I went mad, almost as
9   an act of theory:
10   the lost are found
11   the sick are healthy
12   the non-creators are the
13   creators.


        3.


14   even if I were a comfortable, domesticated
15   sophisticate I could never drink the
16   blood of the masses and
17   call it wine.


        4.


18   why did I have to lift that pretty girl's
19   car by the bumper because the jack got stuck?
20   I couldn't straighten up
21   and they took me away like a pretzel and straightened
22   me but I still couldn't move ...
23   it was the hospital's fault, the doctors' fault.
24   then those two boys dropped me on the way to the
25   x-ray room ... I hollered LAWSUIT!
26   but I guess it was that girl's fault---

[Page 224 ]


27   she shouldn't have shown me all that leg
28   and haunch.


        5.


29   listen, listen, SPACESHIT LOVE, TORN IN DRIP OUT,
30   SPACESHIT LOVE, LOVE, LOVE; KILL, LEARN TO USE A
31   WEAPON; OPEN AREAS, REALIZE, BE DIVINE, SPACESHIT
32   LOVE, IT'S approaching ...


        6.


33   I did a take-off of E.H. in my first novel,
34   been living green ever since. I'm probably
35   the best journalist America ever had, I can
36   bullshit on any subject, and that counts for
37   something. you admire me much more
38   than the first man you meet on the street
39   in the morning. basically, though, it's a
40   fact, I've lived during an era of no writers
41   at all, so I've earned a position
42   because nothing else appeared. o.k.,
43   it's a bad age. I suppose I am number
44   one. But it's hardly the same as when we
45   had giants turning us on. forget it:
46   I'm living green.


        7.


47   I was a bad writer, I killed N.C. because I made
48   more of him than there was, and then the /ins/
49   made more of my book than there was. there have
50   been only 3 bad writers in acceptable American
51   literature. Drieser, of course, was the worst.
52   then we had Thomas Wolfe, and then we had me. but
53   when I try to choose between me and Wolfe, I've
54   got to take Wolfe. I mean as the worst. I like
55   to think of what Capote, another bad writer said

[Page 225 ]


56   about me: he just typewrites. sometimes even
57   bad writers tell the truth.


        8.


58   my problem, like most, is artistic preciousness. I
59   exist, full of french fries and glory
60   and then I look around, see the Art-form, pop into
61   it and tell them how fine I am and what I think.
62   this is the same tiresomeness that has almost des-
63   troyed art for centuries. I made a record once of
64   myself reading my poems to a lion at the zoo. he really
65   /roared,/ as if he were in pain. all the poets play
66   this record and laugh when they get drunk.


        9.


67   remember my novel about jail where
68   photos of heroes and lovers floated against the
69   rock walls?
70   I got famous. I came over here.
71   I got hot for the black motorcyclists of Valley
72   West and Bakersfield
73   who took my fame and jammed it
74   and made me suck their loneliness and dementia
75   and their dream of Cadillac white soul and
76   Cadillac black soul
77   and they creamed up my ass
78   and into my nostrils and into my ears
79   while I said, Communism, Communism
80   and they grinned and knew I didn't mean it.

        Sparrow Press ]



1   I am
2   hung by a nail
3   the sun melts my heart
4   I am
5   cousin to the snake
6   and am afraid of waterfalls
7   I am
8   afraid of women and green walls



9   the police stop me and
10   tell me
11   while the trees whirl in the wind
12   (I am hungover) that my muffler is shot and
13   my windshield wiper doesn't work
14   and the lens on my back-up light is broken.
15   I don't have a back-up light,
16   sign the citation and am thankful,
17   inside,
18   that they don't take me in for what I'm
19   thinking



20   sadness drips like water beads
21   in a half-poisoned well,
22   I know that my chances have narrowed down to
23   almost nothing---
24   I'm like a bug in the bathroom when you flick on the
25   lightswitch at 3 a.m.



26   love, finally, with a washrag stuffed down its
27   throat, pictures of joy
28   turned to paperclips, you
29   know you know you know.
30   once you understand this process (what you
31   must understand
32   is
33   that most things
34   just won't work, so
35   you don't try to save

[Page 227 ]


36   them, and by the time you learn this
37   you've run out of
38   years)---once you understand this process
39   you need only get burned 2 or 3 more times
40   before they stuff you away, and
41   it's good to know that---
42   stop being so fucking quick with your
43   rejoinders and relax---
44   you're about finished, too, just
45   like I am. no shame
46   there. I can walk into any bar and
47   order a scotch and water,
48   pay,
49   and put my hand around the glass,
50   they don't know, they won't know,
51   either about you or about me,
52   they'll talk about football and the
53   weather and the energy crisis,
54   and our hands will reach up
55   the mirror watching the hands
56   and we'll drink it down---



57   Jane, Barbara, Frances, Linda, Liza, Stella,
58   father's brown leather slipper
59   upsidedown in the bathroom,
60   nameless dead dogs,
61   tomorrow's newspaper,
62   water boiling out of the radiator on a
63   Thursday afternoon, burning your arm
64   halfway to the elbow, and not even being
65   angry at the pain,
66   grinning for the winners
67   grinning for the guy who fucked your girl
68   while you were drunk or away
69   and grinning for the girl who let him.
70   the roses howl
71   in the dim wind,
72   we have
73   said the necessary things, and
74   getting out is next, only I'd like

[Page 228 ]


75   to say
76   no matter what they've said,
77   I've never been mad
78   at anything.

        Bukowski, Charles :  dreamlessly [from Burning in Water Drowning
        in Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   old grey-haired waitresses
2   in cafes at night
3   have given it up,
4   and as I walk down sidewalks of
5   light and look into windows
6   of nursing homes
7   I can see that it is no longer
8   with them.
9   I see people sitting on park benches
10   and I can see by the way they
11   sit and look
12   that it is gone.


13   I see people driving cars
14   and I see by the way
15   they drive their cars
16   that they neither love nor are
17   loved---
18   nor do they consider
19   sex. it is all forgotten
20   like an old movie.


21   I see people in department stores and
22   supermarkets
23   walking down aisles
24   buying things
25   and I can see by the way their clothing
26   fits them and by the way they walk
27   and by their faces and their eyes
28   that they care for nothing
29   and that nothing cares
30   for them.


31   I can see a hundred people a day
32   who have given up
33   entirely.


34   if I go to a racetrack
35   or a sporting event
36   I can see thousands
37   that feel for nothing or

[Page 230 ]


38   no one
39   and get no feeling
40   back.


41   everywhere I see those who
42   crave nothing but
43   food, shelter, and
44   clothing; they concentrate
45   on that,
46   dreamlessly.


47   I do not understand why these people do not
48   vanish
49   I do not understand why these people do not
50   expire
51   why the clouds
52   do not murder them
53   or why the dogs
54   do not murder them
55   or why the flowers and the children
56   do not murder them,
57   I do not understand.


58   I suppose they are murdered
59   yet I can't adjust to the
60   fact of them
61   because they are so
62   many.


63   each day,
64   each night,
65   there are more of them
66   in the subways and
67   in the buildings and
68   in the parks


69   they feel no terror
70   at not loving
71   or at not
72   being loved

[Page 231 ]




73   so many many many
74   of my fellow
75   creatures.

        Bukowski, Charles :  palm leaves [from Burning in Water Drowning
        in Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   at exactly 12:00 midnight
2   1973-74
3   Los Angeles
4   it began to rain on the
5   palm leaves outside my window
6   the horns and firecrackers
7   went off
8   and it thundered.


9   I'd gone to bed at 9 p.m.
10   turned out the lights
11   pulled up the covers---
12   their gaiety, their happiness,
13   their screams, their paper hats,
14   their automobiles, their women,
15   their amateur drunks ...


16   New Year's Eve always terrifies
17   me


18   life knows nothing of years.



19   now the horns have stopped and
20   the firecrackers and the thunder ...
21   it's all over in five minutes ...
22   all I hear is the rain
23   on the palm leaves,
24   and I think,
25   I will never understand men,
26   but I have lived
27   it through.

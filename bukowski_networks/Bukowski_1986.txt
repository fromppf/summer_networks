        Bukowski, Charles :  1813-1883 [from You Get So Alone At Times
        That It Just Makes Sense (1986) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   listening to Wagner
2   as outside in the dark the wind blows a cold rain the
3   trees wave and shake lights go
4   off and on the walls creak and the cats run under the
5   bed ...


6   Wagner battles the agonies, he's emotional but
7   solid, he's the supreme fighter, a giant in a world of
8   pygmies, he takes it straight on through, he breaks
9   barriers
10   an
11   astonishing FORCE of sound as


12   everything here shakes
13   shivers
14   bends
15   blasts
16   in fierce gamble


17   yes, Wagner and the storm intermix with the wine as
18   nights like this run up my wrists and up into my head and
19   back down into the
20   gut


21   some men never
22   die
23   and some men never
24   live


25   but we're all alive
26   tonight.

        Bukowski, Charles :  red Mercedes [from You Get So Alone At
        Times That It Just Makes Sense (1986) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   naturally, we are all caught in
2   downmoods, it's a matter of
3   chemical imbalance
4   and an existence
5   which, at times,
6   seems to forbid
7   any real chance at
8   happiness.


9   I was in a downmood
10   when this rich pig
11   along with his blank
12   inamorata
13   in this red Mercedes
14   cut
15   in front of me
16   at racetrack parking.


17   it clicked inside of me
18   in a flash:
19   I'm going to pull that fucker
20   out of his car and
21   kick his
22   ass!


23   I followed him
24   into Valet parking
25   parked behind him
26   and jumped from my
27   car
28   ran up to his
29   door
30   and yanked at

[Page 15 ]


31   it.
32   it was
33   locked.
34   the
35   windows were
36   up.


37   I rapped on the window
38   on his
39   side:
40   "open up! I'm gonna
41   bust your
42   ass!"


43   he just sat there
44   looking straight
45   ahead.
46   his woman did
47   likewise.
48   they wouldn't look
49   at me.


50   he was 30 years
51   younger
52   but I knew I could
53   take him
54   he was soft and
55   pampered.


56   I beat on the window
57   with my
58   fist:
59   "come on out, shithead,
60   or I'm going to start
61   breaking
62   glass!"

[Page 16 ]




63   he gave a small nod
64   to his
65   woman.


66   I saw her reach
67   into the glove
68   compartment
69   open it
70   and slip him the
71   .32


72   I saw him hold it
73   down low
74   and snap off the
75   safety.


76   I walked off
77   toward the
78   clubhouse, it looked
79   like a damned good
80   card
81   that
82   day.


83   all I had to do
84   was
85   be there.

        Bukowski, Charles :  retired [from You Get So Alone At Times
        That It Just Makes Sense (1986) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   pork chops, said my father, I love
2   pork chops!


3   and I watched him slide the grease
4   into his mouth.


5   pancakes, he said, pancakes with
6   syrup, butter and bacon!


7   I watched his lips heavy wetted with
8   all that.


9   coffee, he said, I like coffee so hot
10   it burns my throat!


11   sometimes it was too hot and he spit it
12   out across the table.


13   mashed potatoes and gravy, he said, I
14   love mashed potatoes and gravy!


15   he jowled that in, his cheeks puffed as
16   if he had the mumps.


17   chili and beans, he said, I love chili and
18   beans!


19   and he gulped it down and farted for hours
20   loudly, grinning after each fart.


21   strawberry shortcake, he said, with vanilla
22   ice cream, that's the way to end a meal!

[Page 18 ]




23   he always talked about retirement, about
24   what he was going to do when he
25   retired.
26   when he wasn't talking about food he talked
27   on and on about
28   retirement.


29   he never made it to retirement, he died one day while
30   standing at the sink
31   filling a glass of water.
32   he straightened like he'd been
33   shot.
34   the glass fell from his hand
35   and he dropped backwards
36   landing flat
37   his necktie slipping to the
38   left.


39   afterwards
40   people said they couldn't believe
41   it.
42   he looked
43   great.
44   distinguished white
45   sideburns, pack of smokes in his
46   shirt pocket, always cracking
47   jokes, maybe a little
48   loud and maybe with a bit of bad
49   temper
50   but all in all
51   a seemingly sound
52   individual


53   never missing a day
54   of work.


[Page 19 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  working it out [from You Get So Alone At
        Times That It Just Makes Sense (1986) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   in this steamy a.m. Hades claps its Herpes hands and
2   a woman sings through my radio, her voice comes clambering
3   through the smoke, and the wine fumes ...


4   it's a lonely time, she sings, and you're not
5   mine and it makes me feel so bad,
6   this thing of being me ...


7   I can hear cars on the freeway, it's like a distant sea
8   sludged with people
9   while over my other shoulder, far over on 7th street
10   near Western
11   is the hospital, that house of agony---
12   sheets and bedpans and arms and heads and
13   expirations;
14   everything is so sweetly awful, so continuously and
15   sweetly awful: the art of consummation: life eating
16   life ...
17   once in a dream I saw a snake swallowing its own
18   tail, it swallowed and swallowed until
19   it got halfway round, and there it stopped and
20   there it stayed, it was stuffed with its own
21   self. some fix, that.
22   we only have ourselves to go on, and it's
23   enough ...


24   I go downstairs for another bottle, switch on the
25   cable and there's Greg Peck pretending he's
26   F. Scott and he's very excited and he's reading his
27   manuscript to his lady.
28   I turn the set
29   off.

[Page 20 ]




30   what kind of writer is that? reading his pages to
31   a lady? this is a violation ...


32   I return upstairs and my two cats follow me, they are
33   fine fellows, we have no discontent, we have no
34   arguments, we listen to the same music, never vote for a
35   president.
36   one of my cats, the big one, leaps on the back
37   of my chair, rubs against my shoulders and
38   neck.


39   "no good," I tell him, "I'm not going
40   to read you this
41   poem."


42   he leaps to the floor and walks out to the
43   balcony and his buddy
44   follows.


45   they sit and watch the night; we've got the
46   power of sanity here.


47   these early a.m. mornings when almost everybody
48   is asleep, small night bugs, winged things
49   enter, and circle and whirl.
50   the machine hums its electric hum, and having
51   opened and tasted the new bottle I type the next
52   line. you
53   can read it to your lady and she'll probably tell you
54   it's nonsense. she'll be
55   reading /Tender Is the/
56   /Night/ .

        Bukowski, Charles :  trashcan lives [from You Get So Alone At
        Times That It Just Makes Sense (1986) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the wind blows hard tonight
2   and it's a cold wind
3   and I think about
4   the boys on the row.
5   I hope some of them have a bottle
6   of red.


7   it's when you're on the row
8   that you notice that
9   /everything/
10   is owned
11   and that there are locks on
12   /everything/ .
13   this is the way a democracy
14   works:
15   you get what you can,
16   try to keep that
17   and add to it
18   if possible.


19   this is the way a dictatorship
20   works too
21   only they either enslave or
22   destroy their
23   derelicts.


24   we just forget
25   ours.


26   in either case
27   it's a hard
28   cold
29   wind.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the lost generation [from You Get So Alone
        At Times That It Just Makes Sense (1986) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   have been reading a book about a rich literary lady
2   of the twenties and her husband who
3   drank, ate and partied their way through
4   Europe
5   meeting Pound, Picasso, A. Huxley, Lawrence, Joyce,
6   F. Scott, Hemingway, many
7   others;
8   the famous were like precious toys to
9   them,
10   and the way it reads
11   the famous allowed themselves to become
12   precious toys.
13   all through the book
14   I waited for just /one/ of the famous
15   to tell this rich literary lady and her
16   rich literary husband to
17   get off and out
18   but, apparently, none of them ever
19   did.
20   Instead they were photographed with the lady
21   and her husband
22   at various seasides
23   looking intelligent
24   as if all this was part of the act
25   of Art.
26   perhaps because the wife and husband
27   fronted a lush press that
28   had something to do
29   with it.
30   and they were all photographed together
31   at parties
32   or outside of Sylvia Beach's bookshop.
33   it's true that many of them were

[Page 25 ]


34   great and/or original artists,
35   but it all seems such a snobby precious
36   affair,
37   and the husband finally committed his
38   threatened suicide
39   and the lady published one of my first
40   short stories in the
41   40's and is now
42   dead, yet
43   I can't forgive either of them
44   for their rich dumb lives
45   and I can't forgive their precious toys
46   either
47   for being
48   that.

        Bukowski, Charles :  my non-ambitious ambition [from You Get So
        Alone At Times That It Just Makes Sense (1986) , Black Sparrow
        Press ]



1   my father had little sayings which he mostly shared
2   during dinner sessions; food made him think of
3   survival:
4   "succeed or suck eggs ..."
5   "the early bird gets the worm ..."
6   "early to bed and early to rise makes a man (etc.) ..."
7   "anybody who wants to can make it in America ..."
8   "God takes care of those who (etc.) ..."


9   I had no particular idea who he was talking
10   to, and personally I thought him a
11   crazed and stupid brute
12   but my mother /always/ interspersed these
13   sessions with: "Henry, /listen/ to your
14   father."


15   at that age I didn't have any other
16   choice
17   but as the food went down with the
18   sayings
19   the appetite and the digestion went
20   along with them.


21   it seemed to me that I had never met
22   another person on earth
23   as discouraging to my happiness
24   as my father.


25   and it appeared that I had
26   the same effect upon
27   him.

[Page 28 ]




28   "You are a /bum/ ," he told me, "and you'll
29   always be a /bum/ !"


30   and I thought, if being a bum is to be the
31   opposite of what this son-of-a-bitch
32   is, then that's what I'm going to
33   be.


34   and it's too bad he's been dead
35   so long
36   for now he can't see
37   how beautifully I've succeeded
38   at
39   that.

        Bukowski, Charles :  education [from You Get So Alone At Times
        That It Just Makes Sense (1986) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   at that small inkwell desk
2   I had trouble with the words
3   "sing" and "sign."
4   I don't know why
5   but
6   "sing" and "sign":
7   it bothered
8   me.


9   the others went on and learned
10   new things
11   but I just sat there
12   thinking about
13   "sing" and "sign."
14   there was something there
15   I couldn't
16   overcome.


17   what it gave me was a
18   bellyache as
19   I looked at the backs of all those
20   heads.


21   the lady teacher had a
22   very fierce face
23   it ran sharply to a
24   point
25   and was heavy with white
26   powder.


27   one afternoon
28   she asked my mother to come
29   see her

[Page 30 ]




30   and I sat with them
31   in the classroom
32   as they
33   talked.


34   "he's not learning
35   anything," the teacher
36   told my
37   mother.


38   "please give him a
39   chance, Mrs. Sims!"


40   "he's not /trying/ , Mrs.
41   Chinaski!"


42   my mother began to
43   cry.


44   Mrs. Sims sat there
45   and watched
46   her.


47   it went on for some
48   minutes.


49   then Mrs. Sims said,
50   "well, we'll see what we
51   can do ..."



52   then I was walking with
53   my mother
54   we were walking in
55   front of the school,
56   there was much green grass

[Page 31 ]


57   and then the
58   sidewalk.


59   "oh, Henry," my mother said,
60   "your father is so disappointed in
61   you, I don't know what we are
62   going to do!"


63   father, my mind said,
64   father and father and
65   father.


66   words like that.


67   I decided not to learn anything
68   in that
69   school.


70   my mother walked along
71   beside me.
72   she wasn't anything at
73   all.
74   and I had a bellyache
75   and even the trees we walked
76   under
77   seemed less than
78   trees
79   and more like everything
80   else.

1   throwing your shoe at 3 a.m. and smashing the window, then
2   sticking
3   your head through the shards of glass and laughing as the
4   phone rings
5   with authoritative threats as you curse back through the
6   receiver, slam
7   it down as the woman screeches: "WHAT THE FUCK YA
8   DOIN', YA ASSHOLE!"


9   you smirk, look at her (what's this?), you're cut somewhere,
10   love it, the
11   dripping of red onto your dirty torn undershirt, the whiskey
12   roaring
13   through your invincibility: you're young, you're big, and the
14   world
15   stinks from centuries of Humanity while


16   you're on course
17   and there's something left to drink---
18   it's good, it's a dramatic farce and you can handle it with
19   verve, style, grace and elite
20   mysticism.


21   another hotel drunk---thank god for hotels and whiskey and
22   ladies of the
23   street!


24   you turn to her: "you chippy hunk of shit, don't bad mouth
25   me! I'm
26   the toughest guy in town, you don't know who the hell you're
27   in this room
28   with!"

29   she just looks, half-believing ... a cigarette dangling, she's half-
30   insane, looking for an out; she's hard, she's scared, she's been
31   fooled, taken, abused, used, over-
32   used ...


33   but, under all that, to me she's the /flower/ , I see her as she was
34   before she was ruined by the lies: theirs and
35   hers.


36   to me, she's new again as I am new: we have a chance
37   together.


38   I walk over and fill her drink: "you got class, doll, you're not
39   like the
40   others ..."


41   she likes that and I like it too because to make a thing true all
42   you've
43   got to do is believe.


44   I sit across from her as she tells me about her life, I give her
45   refills,
46   light her cigarettes, I listen and the City of the Angels
47   listens: she's had a hard row.


48   I get sentimental and decide not to fuck her: one more man for
49   her
50   won't help and one more woman for me won't
51   matter---besides, she doesn't look that
52   good.


53   actually, her life is boring and rather common but most are---
54   mine is too
55   except when lifted by
56   whiskey

[Page 34 ]




57   she gets into a crying-jag, she's cute, really, and pitiful, all she
58   wants
59   is what she always wanted, only it's getting further and further
60   away.


61   then she stops crying, we just drink and smoke, it's
62   peaceful---I won't bother her that
63   night ...


64   I have trouble trying to yank the pull-down bed from the wall,
65   she
66   comes up to help, we pull together---suddenly, it
67   releases---flings
68   itelf upon us, a hard death-like mindless object, it knocks us
69   upon
70   our asses beneath it as
71   first in fear we scream
72   then begin laughing, laughing like
73   crazy.


74   she gets the bathroom first, then I use it, then we stretch out
75   and
76   sleep.


77   I am awakened in the early morning ... she is down at my
78   center, she has
79   me in her mouth and is working furiously.


80   "it's all right," I say, "you don't have to do
81   that."


82   she continues, finishes ...

[Page 35 ]




83   in the morning we pass the desk clerk, he has on thick-rimmed
84   dark glasses,
85   seems to sit in the shade of some tarantula dream: he was there
86   when we
87   entered, he is there now: some eternal darkness, we are almost
88   to the door
89   when he says:
90   "don't come back."


91   we walk 2 blocks up, turn left, walk one block, then one block
92   south, enter
93   Willie's at the middle of the
94   block, place ourselves at bar
95   center.


96   we order beer for starters, we sit there as she searches her purse
97   for
98   cigarettes, then I get up, move toward the juke box, put a coin
99   within, come back, sit down, she lifts her glass, "the first one's
100   best,"
101   and I lift my drink, "and the last ..."


102   outside, the traffic runs up and down, down and
103   up,
104   going
105   nowhere.

        Bukowski, Charles :  driving test [from You Get So Alone At
        Times That It Just Makes Sense (1986) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   drivers
2   in defense and anger
3   often give the
4   finger
5   to those
6   who become involved in their
7   driving problems.


8   I am aware what the
9   signal of the finger
10   implies
11   yet when it is directed
12   at me
13   sometimes
14   I can't help laughing at
15   the florid
16   twisted
17   faces
18   and
19   the gesture.


20   yet today
21   I found myself
22   giving the finger
23   to some guy
24   who pulled directly
25   into my lane
26   without waiting
27   from a supermarket
28   exit.


29   I shook the finger at
30   him.

[Page 39 ]


31   he saw it
32   and I drove along right on his
33   rear
34   bumper.


35   it was my first
36   time.


37   I was a member of the
38   club
39   and I felt like a
40   fucking
41   fool.

1   he's got all the tools but he's lazy, has no
2   fire, the ladies drain his senses, his
3   emotions, he just wants to drive his
4   flashy car
5   he gets a wax job once a month
6   throws away his shoes when they get
7   scuffed
8   but
9   he's got the best right hand in the
10   business
11   and his left hook can cave in a man's ribs
12   /if/ I can get him to do it
13   but
14   he has no god damned imagination
15   he's in the top ten
16   but the music is missing.
17   he makes the money
18   but it's all going to get away from
19   him.
20   some day he's not going to be able to do
21   even the little
22   he's doing now.
23   his idea of victory is to pull down as
24   many women's panties as he
25   can.
26   he's
27   champ at that.
28   and when you see me screaming at him
29   in his corner between
30   rounds
31   I'm trying to awaken him to the fact that
32   the TIME is
33   NOW.

[Page 41 ]




34   he just grins at me:
35   "hell, /you/ fight him, he's a
36   bitch ..."

38   men
39   can do it

1   there wasn't a stove
2   and we put cans of beans

5   up
6   and we read the Sunday papers
7   on Monday
8   after digging them out of the

11   money for wine

        Bukowski, Charles :  darkness [from You Get So Alone At Times
        That It Just Makes Sense (1986) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   darkness falls upon Humanity
2   and faces become terrible
3   things
4   that wanted more than there
5   was.


6   all our days are marked with
7   unexpected
8   affronts---some
9   disastrous, others
10   less so
11   but the process is
12   wearing and
13   continuous.
14   attrition rules.
15   most give
16   way
17   leaving
18   empty spaces
19   where people should
20   be.


21   our progenitors, our
22   educational systems, the
23   land, the media, the
24   way
25   have
26   deluded and misled the
27   masses: they have been
28   defeated
29   by the aridity of
30   the /actual/
31   dream.

[Page 47 ]




32   they were
33   unaware that
34   achievement or victory or
35   luck or
36   whatever the hell you
37   want to call
38   it
39   must have
40   its defeats.


41   it's only the re-gathering and
42   going on
43   which lends substance
44   to whatever magic
45   might possibly
46   evolve.


47   and now
48   as we ready to self-destruct
49   there is very little left to
50   kill


51   which makes the tragedy
52   less and more
53   much much
54   more.

        Bukowski, Charles :  termites of the page [from You Get So Alone
        At Times That It Just Makes Sense (1986) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the problem that I've found with
2   most poets that I have known is that
3   they've never had an 8 hour job
4   and there is nothing
5   that will put a person
6   more in touch
7   with the realities
8   than
9   an 8 hour job.


10   most of these poets
11   that I have known
12   have
13   seemingly existed on
14   air alone
15   but
16   it hasn't been truly
17   so:
18   behind them has been
19   a family member
20   usually a wife or mother
21   supporting these
22   souls
23   and
24   so it's no wonder
25   they have written so
26   poorly:
27   they have been protected
28   against the actualities
29   from the
30   beginning
31   and they
32   understand nothing

[Page 49 ]


33   but the ends of their
34   fingernails
35   and
36   their delicate
37   hairlines
38   and
39   their lymph
40   nodes.


41   their words are
42   unlived, unfurnished, un-
43   true, and worse---so
44   fashionably
45   dull.


46   soft and safe
47   they gather together to
48   plot, hate,
49   gossip, most of these
50   American poets
51   pushing and hustling their
52   talents
53   playing at
54   greatness.


55   poet (?):
56   that word needs re-
57   defining.


58   when I hear that
59   word
60   I get a rising in the
61   gut
62   as if I were about to
63   puke.

[Page 50 ]




64   let them have the
65   stage

1   now look, she said, stretched out on the bed, I don't want
2   anything
3   personal, let's just do it, I don't want to get involved, got
4   it?


5   she kicked off her high-heeled shoes ...


6   sure, he said, standing there, let's just pretend that we've
7   already done it, there's nothing less involved than that, is
8   there?


9   what the hell do you mean? she asked.


10   I mean, he said, I'd rather drink
11   anyhow.


12   and he poured himself one.


13   it was a lousy night in Vegas and he walked to the window
14   and
15   looked out at the dumb lights.


16   you a fag? she asked, you a god damned
17   fag?


18   no, he said.


19   you don't have to get shitty, she said, just because you lost at
20   the tables---we drove all the way here to have a good time and
21   now look at you: sucking at that booze, you coulda done that
22   in
23   L.A.!

[Page 52 ]




24   right, he said, one thing I do like to get involved with is the
25   fucking bottle.


26   I want you to take me home, she said.


27   my pleasure, he said, let's
28   go.


29   it was one of those times where nothing was lost because
30   nothing
31   had ever been found and as she got dressed it was sad for
32   him
33   not because of him and the lady but because of all the millions
34   like him and the lady
35   as the lights blinked out there, everything so effort-
36   lessly false.


37   she was ready, fast: let's get the hell out of here, she
38   said.


39   right, he said, and they walked out the door together.

4   go ahead.


5   he lost $350,000.00
6   mostly at the racetrack
7   but still couldn't write /or/
8   pay his taxes.


9   he ran from the govt. and exiled himself
10   in Paris.


11   he later came back, sweated it
12   out
13   in hock up to his
14   ass---
15   royalties dropping
16   off.


17   he still couldn't write or
18   what he wrote didn't
19   work
20   because that tremendous
21   brave optimism
22   that buoyed everybody up

        Bukowski, Charles :  the man in the brown suit [from You Get So
        Alone At Times That It Just Makes Sense (1986) , Black Sparrow
        Press ]



1   fuck, he was small
2   maybe 5-3,
3   135 pounds,
4   I didn't like
5   him,
6   he sat there at his desk
7   at the
8   bank
9   and as I waited in line
10   he seemed to have a way
11   of glancing at
12   me
13   and I stared
14   back,
15   I don't know what
16   it was
17   that caused the
18   animosity.
19   he had this little mustache
20   that drooped
21   at the ends,
22   he was in his mid-forties
23   and like most people who worked
24   in banks
25   he had a non-committal
26   yet self-important
27   personality.


28   one day I almost went
29   over the railing
30   to ask him
31   what the hell

[Page 60 ]


32   was he looking
33   at?


34   today I went in
35   and stood in line
36   and saw him leave his
37   desk.
38   one of the lady tellers was
39   having a problem
40   with a man
41   at her
42   window
43   and the man
44   in the brown suit
45   began to hold
46   counsel with both of
47   them.
48   suddenly
49   the man in the brown suit
50   vaulted the
51   railing
52   got behind the other
53   man
54   wrapped his arms
55   about him
56   then dragged him along
57   to a latch
58   entrance
59   along the railing
60   reached over
61   unhooked the latch
62   while still managing to
63   hold the
64   man.

[Page 61 ]




65   then he dragged him
66   in there
67   latched the
68   gate
69   and while holding the
70   man
71   he told one of the
72   girls,
73   "Phone the
74   police."


75   the man he was holding was
76   about 20, black, a good 6-2,
77   maybe 190 pounds,
78   and I thought, hey,
79   break loose, man, jail is a
80   long time.


81   but he just stood
82   there
83   being
84   held.


85   I left before the
86   police
87   arrived.


88   the next time
89   I went to the bank
90   the man in the brown suit
91   was behind his
92   desk.
93   and when he glanced at
94   me
95   I smiled just a
96   little.

1   they go one by one and as they do it gets closer
2   to me and
3   I don't mind that so much, it's
4   just that I can't be practical about the
5   mathematics that take others
6   to the vanishing point.


7   last Saturday
8   one of racing's greatest harness drivers
9   died---little Joe O'Brien.
10   I had seen him win many a
11   race. he
12   had a peculiar rocking motion
13   he flicked the reins
14   and rocked his body back and
15   forth. he
16   applied this motion
17   during the stretch run and
18   it was quite dramatic and
19   effective ...


20   he was so small that he couldn't
21   lay the whip on as hard as the
22   others
23   so
24   he rocked and rocked
25   in the sulky
26   and the horse felt the lightning
27   of his excitement
28   that rhythmic crazy rocking was
29   transferred from man to
30   beast ...
31   the whole thing had the feel of a

[Page 63 ]


32   crapshooter calling to the
33   gods, and the gods
34   so often answered ...


35   I saw Joe O'Brien win
36   endless photo finishes
37   many by a
38   nose.
39   he'd take a horse
40   another driver couldn't get a
41   run out of
42   and Joe would put his touch
43   to it
44   and the animal would
45   most often respond with
46   a flurry of wild energy.


47   Joe O'Brien was the finest harness driver
48   I had ever seen
49   and I'd seen many over the
50   decades.
51   nobody could nurse and cajole
52   a trotter or a pacer
53   like little Joe
54   nobody could make the magic work
55   like Joe.


56   they go one by one
57   presidents
58   garbage men
59   killers
60   actors
61   pickpockets
62   boxers
63   hit men
64   ballet dancers

[Page 64 ]


65   fishermen
66   doctors
67   fry cooks
68   like
69   that


70   but Joe O'Brien
71   it's going to be hard
72   hard
73   to find a replacement for
74   little Joe


75   and
76   at the ceremony
77   held for him
78   at the track tonight
79   (Los Alamitos 10-1-84)
80   as the drivers gathered in a
81   circle
82   in their silks
83   at the finish line
84   I had to turn my back
85   to the crowd
86   and climb the upper grandstand
87   steps
88   to the wall
89   so the people wouldn't
90   see me
91   cry.

1   sometimes when everything seems at

7   seem wasted---
8   stretched there upon my bed

        Bukowski, Charles :  the chemistry of things [from You Get So
        Alone At Times That It Just Makes Sense (1986) , Black Sparrow
        Press ]



1   I always thought Mary Lou was skinny and
2   not much to look at
3   while almost all the other guys
4   thought she was a
5   hot number.
6   maybe that's why she hung around me
7   in Jr. High.
8   my indifference must have attracted
9   her.


10   I was cool and mean in those days
11   and when the guys asked me,
12   "you banged Mary Lou yet?"
13   I answered them with the
14   truth: "she
15   bores me."


16   there was this guy
17   he taught chemistry.
18   Mr. Humm. Humm wore a little bow
19   tie and a black coat, a
20   cheap wrinkled job, he was
21   supposed to have
22   brains


23   and one day Mary Lou came to
24   me
25   and said Humm kept her
26   after class
27   and had taken her into the
28   closet and
29   kissed her and
30   fondled her

[Page 67 ]


31   panties.
32   she was crying, "what will I
33   do?"


34   "forget it," I told her,
35   "those chemicals have scrambled
36   his brain. we have an English teacher
37   who hikes her skirt up around her
38   hips every day and wants to go to bed with
39   every guy in class. we enjoy her but
40   ignore her."


41   "why don't you beat Mr. Humm up?"
42   she asked me.


43   "I could but they'd transfer me to
44   Stuart Hall."


45   in Stuart Hall they beat the shit
46   out of you
47   and they ignored math, English,
48   music, they just stuck you into auto
49   shop
50   where you fixed up old cars
51   which they resold at big
52   profits.


53   "I thought you cared for me," said Mary
54   Lou, "don't you realize he
55   kissed me, stuck his tongue down my
56   throat and had his hand up my
57   behind?"


58   "well," I said, "we saw Mrs. Lattimore's
59   pussy the other day, in English."

[Page 68 ]




60   Mary Lou walked off
61   crying ...


62   well, she told her
63   mother and Humm got his, he
64   had to
65   resign, poor son of a
66   bitch.


67   after that the guys asked me,
68   "hey, what do you think of Humm
69   sticking his hand up your girl's
70   ass?"


71   "just another guy with no
72   taste," I answered.


73   I was cool and mean
74   in those days and I went on to
75   high school, the same one
76   Mary Lou attended
77   where she secretly got
78   married
79   during her senior year
80   to a guy
81   I knew, a guy I
82   outdrank and beat the shit out of
83   a couple of
84   times.


85   the guy thought he had
86   something.
87   he wanted me to be
88   best man.

[Page 69 ]




89   I told him, no thanks and lots of
90   luck.


91   I never could see what
92   they saw in
93   Mary Lou.
94   and poor Humm: what a
95   lonely sick old
96   fart.


97   anyhow, then I went on to
98   city college
99   where the only molesting I
100   could see going on
101   was what they did to your
102   mind.

1   "I can't live with you anymore,"
2   she said,
3   " /look/ at you!"


4   "uuh?" I
5   asked.


6   " /look/ at you!
7   sitting in that god
8   damned
9   chair!
10   your belly is sticking out
11   of your
12   underwear,
13   you've burnt cigarette
14   holes in all your
15   shirts!
16   all you /do/ is suck
17   on that god damned
18   beer,
19   bottle after bottle,
20   what do you get out of
21   that?"


22   "the damage has been
23   done," I told
24   her.


25   "what're you talking
26   about?"


27   "nothing matters and
28   we know nothing matters

[Page 71 ]




29   and /that/
30   matters ..."


31   "you're drunk!"


32   "come on, baby, let's get
33   along, it's
34   easy ..."


35   "not for /me/ !" she screamed,
36   "not for
37   /me/ !"


38   she ran into the bathroom to
39   put on her
40   makeup.
41   I got up for another
42   beer.
43   I sat back down
44   just had the new bottle
45   to my mouth
46   when she came out of the
47   bathroom.


48   "holy shit!" she screamed,
49   "you're
50   /disgusting/ !"


51   I laughed right into the
52   bottle, gagged, spit a mouthful of
53   beer across my
54   undershirt.


55   "my god!" she
56   said.

[Page 72 ]




57   she slammed the door and
58   was gone.


59   I looked at the closed door
60   and at the doorknob
61   and strangely
62   I didn't feel
63   alone.

1   ---he's a dandy
2   ---small black mustache
3   ---usually sucking on a cigar


4   he tends to lean into the cars as he
5   transacts business


6   first time I met him, he said,
7   "hey! ya gonna make a
8   killin'?"


9   "maybe," I answered.


10   next meeting it was:
11   "hey, Ramrod! what's
12   /happening/ ?"


13   "very little," I told
14   him.


15   next time I had my girlfriend with me
16   and he just
17   grinned.


18   next time I was
19   alone.


20   "hey," he asked, "where's the young
21   chick?"


22   "I left her at home ..."

[Page 74 ]




23   " /Bullshit/ ! I'll bet she dumped
24   you!"


25   and the next time
26   he really leaned into the car:


27   "what's a guy like /you/ doing driving a
28   BMW? I'll bet you inherited your
29   money, you didn't get this car with your
30   brains!"


31   "how'd you guess?" I
32   answered.


33   that was some weeks ago.
34   I haven't seen him lately.
35   fellow like that, chances are he just moved on
36   to better
37   things.

2   he felt there wasn't the
3   "urgency" in my poems
4   of the present
5   as compared to my poems
6   of the past.


7   now, if this /is/ true
8   why did he write me
9   about it?
10   have I made his days
11   more
12   incomplete?
13   it's

15   well, I too have felt

19   powerful

22   very damned
23   good

25   I never considered
26   writing them to
27   inform them that I
28   sensed their
29   demise.
30   I found the best thing
31   I could do

32   was just to type away
33   at my own work

        Bukowski, Charles :  my first affair with that older woman [from

1   when I look back now
2   at the abuse I took from
3   her
4   I feel shame that I was so
5   innocent,
6   but I must say
7   she did match me drink for
8   drink,
9   and I realized that her life
10   her feelings for things
11   had been ruined
12   along the way
13   and that I was no more than a
14   temporary
15   companion;
16   she was ten years older
17   and mortally hurt by the past
18   and the present;
19   she treated me badly:
20   desertion, other
21   men;
22   she brought me immense
23   pain,
24   continually;
25   she lied, stole;
26   there was desertion,
27   other men,
28   yet we had our moments; and
29   our little soap opera ended
30   with her in a coma
31   in the hospital,
32   and I sat at her bed
33   for hours

[Page 79 ]


34   talking to her,
35   and then she opened her eyes
36   and saw me:
37   "I knew it would be you,"
38   she said.
39   then she closed her
40   eyes.


41   the next day she was
42   dead.


43   I drank alone
44   for two years
45   after that.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the freeway life [from You Get So Alone At
        Times That It Just Makes Sense (1986) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   some fool kept blocking me and I finally got around him, and
2   in the
3   elation of freedom I ran it up to 85 (naturally, first checking
4   the rear
5   view for our blue suited protectors); then I felt and heard the
6   SMASH of a hard
7   object upon the bottom of my car, but wanting to make the
8   track I willed
9   myself to ignore it (as if that would make it vanish) even
10   though I began
11   to smell gasoline.
12   I checked the gas gauge and it /seemed/ to be holding ...


13   it had been a terrible week already
14   but, you know, defeat can strengthen just as victory can
15   weaken, and if
16   you have the proper luck and the holy endurance the gods just
17   /might/ deliver
18   the proper admixture ...
19   then
20   traffic backed up and stopped, and then I really smelled gas and
21   I saw my
22   gas gauge dipping rapidly, then my radio told me that a man
23   3 miles up
24   on the Vernon overpass had one leg over the side and was
25   threatening
26   suicide,
27   and there I was threatened with being blown to hell
28   as people yelled at me that my tank was broken and pouring
29   gasoline;
30   yes, I nodded back, I know, I know ...
31   meanwhile, waving cars off and working my way over to the
32   outer lane

[Page 81 ]


33   thinking, they are more terrorized than I am:
34   if I go, those nearby might go also.


35   there was no motion in the traffic---the suicide was still trying
36   to make
37   up his mind and my gas gauge dipped into the red
38   and then the necessity of being a proper citizen and waiting for
39   opportunity
40   vanished and I made my move
41   up and over a cement abutment
42   bending my right front wheel
43   I made it to the freeway exit which was totally
44   clear
45   then worked on down to a gas station on Imperial Highway
46   parked it
47   still dripping gas, got out, made it to the phone, got in a call
48   for the tow truck, not a long wait at all, nice drive back in
49   with a black
50   fellow who told me strange stories about stranded
51   motorists ...
52   (like one woman, her hands were frozen to the wheel, took 15
53   minutes of
54   talking and prying to make her let go.)


55   had the car back in a couple of days, was driving back from the
56   track,
57   hit the brake and it wouldn't go down, luckily I wasn't on the
58   freeway
59   yet, cut the ignition, glided to the curb, noted that the steering
60   column cover had ripped loose and blocked the brake, ripped
61   that away, then
62   ripped some more to make sure, then a whole mass of wires
63   spilled out,
64   s h i t ...
65   I turned the key, hit the gas but the car STARTED
66   and I drove off with the dangling wires against my leg

[Page 82 ]


67   thinking
68   do these things happen to other
69   people or am
70   I just the chosen one?
71   I decided it was the latter and got onto the freeway where
72   some guy in a volks swung over and blocked my
73   lane
74   whereupon I swung around the son-of-a-bitch and hit
75   75, 80, 85 ...
76   thinking, the courage it took to get out of bed each
77   morning
78   to face the same things
79   over and over
80   was
81   enormous.

1   I had 40 win on the 6 horse
2   he had 2 lengths in the stretch
3   was running along the rail
4   when the jock whipped him
5   right-handed
6   and the horse hit the wood
7   spilled
8   threw the jock
9   and there went the race
10   for me.


11   that was the 7th race
12   and I considered that the horse
13   might have lost
14   anyhow
15   and then I considered leaving
16   but I decided to play the
17   8th,
18   hit 20 win on a 5 to one
19   shot.


20   in the 9th I went 40 win
21   on the second favorite
22   and when the bell rang to start them
23   the horse reared and
24   left my jock
25   in the stall.


26   I took the escalator down
27   and walked out the
28   gate
29   where a young man asked me
30   for a dollar so he could

[Page 84 ]


31   take the bus
32   home.


33   I gave him the buck and
34   told him,
35   "you ought to stay away from this
36   place."


37   "yeah," he said, "I
38   know."


39   then I walked toward parking
40   searching my coat for
41   cigarettes.


42   nothing.

        Black Sparrow Press ]


1   drove in from the track after losing $50.
2   a hot day out there
3   they pack them in on a Saturday;
4   my feet hurt and I had pains in the neck
5   and about the shoulders---
6   nerves: large crowds of people more than
7   unsettle me.
8   pulled into the driveway and got the
9   mail
10   moved up and parked it
11   went in and opened the IRS letter
12   form 525 (SC) (Rev. 9-83)
13   read it
14   and was informed that I owed
15   TWELVE THOUSAND SIXHUNDREDFOUR DOLLARS
16   AND
17   SEVENTY EIGHT CENTS
18   on my 1981 income tax plus
19   TWO THOUAND EIGHTHUNDREDEIGHTYTHREE
20   DOLLARS
21   AND TWELVE CENTS interest
22   and that further interest was being
23   compounded
24   DAILY.
25   I went into the kitchen and poured a
26   drink.
27   life in America was a curious
28   thing.
29   well, I /could/ let the interest
30   build
31   that's what the government
32   did
33   but after a while they would

[Page 86 ]


34   come for me
35   or whatever I had
36   left.
37   at least that $50 loss at the
38   track didn't look so
39   bad anymore.
40   I'd have to go tomorrow and
41   win $15,487.90 plus
42   daily compounded
43   interest.
44   I drank to that,
45   wishing I had purchased a
46   Racing Form
47   on the way
48   out.

1   I don't know how he does it
2   but every woman he meets is
3   crazy.
4   he will get rid of one
5   crazy woman
6   but he never gets any
7   relief---
8   another crazy moves right in
9   with him.


10   it's only after they move in
11   and begin acting
12   more than strange
13   that they admit to him
14   that they've done madhouse
15   time
16   or that their families have
17   a long history of mental
18   illness.


19   his last one
20   he sent to a shrink
21   once a week:
22   $75 for 45 minutes.
23   after 7 months
24   she walked out on the
25   shrink
26   and said to Al,
27   "that god damned fag doesn't know
28   anything."


29   I don't know how they all find
30   Al.

[Page 88 ]

33   they have their guard up
34   but after 2 or 3 months the
35   guard comes down
36   and there's Al with
37   another one.


38   It got so bad that Al thought
39   maybe it was
40   him
41   so he went to a shrink
42   and asked
43   and the shrink said,
44   "you're one of the sanest men
45   I've ever met."


46   poor Al.


47   that made him feel
48   worse
49   than ever.

1   many of those I met on the reading circuit or heard about on
2   the reading
3   circuit in the old days are now either teaching or poets-in-
4   residence
5   and have garnered Guggenheims and N.E.A.'s and sundry other
6   grants.
7   well, I tried for a Gugg once myself, even got an N.E.A. so I
8   can't
9   knock the act
10   but
11   you should have seen them back then: raggedy-ass, wild-eyed,
12   raving
13   against the order
14   now
15   they have been ingested, digested, rested
16   they write reviews for the journals
17   they write well-worked, quiet, inoffensive poesy
18   they edit so many of the magazines that I have no idea where I
19   should send this
20   poem
21   since they attack my work with alarming regularity
22   and
23   I can't read theirs
24   yet their attacks upon me have been effective in this country
25   and
26   if it weren't for Europe I'd probably still be a starving writer
27   or down at the row
28   or diggin weeds out of your garden
29   or...?


30   well
31   you know the old saying: it's all a matter of
32   taste

[Page 90 ]


33   and
34   either they're right and I'm wrong or I'm right and they're all
35   wrong
36   or
37   maybe it's some place in between.
38   most of the people in the world could care less
39   and
40   I often feel the same
41   way.

        Bukowski, Charles :  helping the old [from You Get So Alone At

1   I was standing in line at the bank today
2   when the old fellow in front of me
3   dropped his glasses (luckily, within the
4   case)
5   and as he bent over
6   I saw how difficult it was for
7   him
8   and I said, "wait, let me get
9   them ..."
10   but as I picked them up
11   he dropped his cane
12   a beautiful, black polished
13   cane
14   and I got the glasses back to him
15   then went for the cane
16   steadying the old boy
17   as I handed him his cane.
18   he didn't speak,
19   he just smiled at me.
20   then he turned
21   forward.


22   I stood behind him waiting
23   my turn.

        [from You Get So Alone At Times That It Just Makes Sense (1986)
        , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   Alabam was a sneak and a thief and he came to my
2   room when I was drunk and
3   each time I got up he shoved me back
4   down.


5   you prick, I told him, you know I can
6   take you!


7   he just shoved me down
8   again.


9   when I sober up, I said, I'm going to kick you
10   all the way to hell!


11   he just kept pushing me
12   around.


13   I finally caught him a good one, right over the
14   temple
15   and he backed off and
16   left.


17   it was a couple of days later
18   I got even: I fucked his
19   girl.


20   then I went down and knocked on his
21   door.


22   well, Alabam, I fucked your woman and now I'm going to
23   kick you all the way to
24   hell!

[Page 93 ]




25   the poor guy started crying, he put his hands over his
26   face and just cried


27   I stood there and watched
28   him.


29   I said, I'm sorry,
30   Alabam.


31   then I left him there, I went back to
32   my room.


33   we were all alkies and none of us had jobs, all we had
34   was each other.


35   even then, my so-called woman was in some bar or
36   somewhere, I hadn't seen her in a couple of
37   days.


38   I had a bottle of port
39   left.


40   I uncorked it and took it down to Alabam's
41   room.


42   said, how about a drink,
43   Rebel?


44   he looked up, stood up, went for two
45   glasses.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the Master Plan [from You Get So Alone At
        Times That It Just Makes Sense (1986) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   starving in a Philadelphia winter
2   trying to be a writer
3   I wrote and wrote and drank and drank and
4   drank
5   and then stopped writing and concentrated on
6   the drinking.


7   it was another
8   art-form.


9   if you can't have any luck with one thing you
10   try another.


11   of course, I had been practicing on the
12   drinking-form
13   since the age of
14   15.


15   and there was much competition
16   in that field
17   also.


18   it was a world full of drunks and writers and
19   drunk writers.


20   and so
21   I became a starving drunk instead of a starving
22   writer.


23   the best thing was the instant
24   result.
25   and I soon became the biggest and
26   best drunk in the neighborhood and

[Page 95 ]


27   maybe the whole
28   city.


29   it sure as hell beat sitting around waiting for
30   those rejection slips from /The New Yorker/ and /The/
31   /Atlantic Monthly/ .


32   of course, I never really considered quitting the
33   writing game, I just wanted to give it a
34   ten year rest
35   figuring if I got famous too early
36   I wouldn't have anything left for the stretch run
37   like I have now, thank
38   you,


39   with the drinking still thrown
40   in.

        Bukowski, Charles :  garbage [from You Get So Alone At Times
        That It Just Makes Sense (1986) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I had taken a tremendous beating,
2   I had chosen a real bull, and because of
3   the girls and for himself and just because of his
4   brutal escaping energy
5   he had almost murdered me:
6   I learned later
7   that even after I was out
8   he had kicked my head again and
9   again
10   and then had emptied several garbage cans
11   over me
12   and then they had left me there
13   in that alley.
14   I was the guy from out of town.


15   it was around 6 a.m. on a Sunday
16   morning when I came
17   around.
18   my face was a mass of
19   bruises, scabs, clots, bumps, lumps, my lips
20   thick and numb, my eyes almost swollen
21   shut
22   but I got to my feet and began
23   walking;
24   I could see traces of the sun, houses, the shaking
25   sidewalk as I
26   moved toward my room
27   then I heard shuffling sounds from the
28   center of the street
29   and I forced my eyes to
30   focus and saw this
31   man staggering
32   his clothing ripped and bloody

[Page 97 ]


33   he smelled of death and darkness
34   but he kept moving forward
35   down the middle of the street
36   as if he had been walking for
37   miles
38   from some event so ugly that
39   the mind itself might refuse to accept it
40   as part of life.
41   my impulse was to help him
42   and I stepped off the
43   curbing
44   and moved toward him.
45   he couldn't see me, he moved forward
46   looking for somewhere to go,
47   anywhere, and
48   I saw one of his eyes hanging
49   out of the socket,
50   dangling.
51   I backed away.
52   he was like a creature not of the
53   earth.
54   I let him go
55   by.
56   I heard him moving away
57   behind me
58   those blind steps
59   lurching, in
60   agony,
61   senselessly
62   alone.


63   I got back on the
64   sidewalk.
65   I got back to my
66   room.
67   I got myself to the

[Page 98 ]


68   bed.
69   fell face up
70   the ceiling up there above me,
71   I waited.


[Page 99 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  my vanishing act [from You Get So Alone At
        Times That It Just Makes Sense (1986) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   when I got sick of the bar
2   and I sometimes did
3   I had a place to go:
4   it was a tall field of grass
5   an abandoned
6   graveyard.
7   I didn't consider this to be a
8   morbid pastime.
9   it just seemed to be the best
10   place to be.
11   it offered a generous cure to
12   the vicious hangover.
13   through the grass I could see
14   the stones,
15   many were tilted
16   at strange angles
17   against gravity
18   as though they must
19   fall
20   but I never saw one
21   fall
22   although there were many of those
23   in the yard.
24   it was cool and dark
25   with a breeze
26   and I often slept
27   there.
28   I was never
29   bothered.


30   each time I returned to the bar
31   after an absence
32   it was always the same with

[Page 100 ]


33   them:
34   "where the hell you
35   been? we thought you
36   died!"


37   I was their bar freak, they needed me
38   to make themselves feel
39   better.
40   just like, at times, I needed that
41   graveyard.

1   in conjunction with

6   any number of HAIL MARYS

8   I'd even go back to living with that whore with the
9   heart of brass just
10   to keep these rivers of shit from rolling through my
11   brain, Captain Walrus, but
12   of course
13   I would never stop playing the horses or
14   drinking
15   but
16   Captain
17   to keep these rivers from flowing
18   I'd promise to never
19   eat eggs again and

23   any member of the Fonda

4   this will hardly be a night to remember
5   sitting here searching for blackheads on the back of my neck
6   as other men enter the sheets with dolls of flame
7   I look into myself and find perfect emptiness.
8   I am out of cigarettes and don't even have a gun to point.
9   this writer's block is my only possession.
10   the second hand on the TIMEX still goes around and

1   of late
2   I've had this thought
3   that this country
4   has gone backwards
5   4 or 5 decades
6   and that all the
7   social advancement
8   the good feeling of
9   person toward
10   person
11   has been washed
12   away
13   and replaced by the same
14   old
15   bigotries.


16   we have
17   more than ever
18   the selfish wants of power
19   the disregard for the
20   weak
21   the old
22   the impoverished
23   the
24   helpless.


25   we are replacing want with
26   war
27   salvation with
28   slavery.


29   we have wasted the
30   gains

[Page 106 ]


31   we have become
32   rapidly
33   less.


34   we have our Bomb
35   it is our fear

38   shame.

1   maybe I'm going crazy, that's all right
2   but these poems keep rising to the top of my
3   head with more and more
4   force. now
5   after the oceans of booze that I have
6   consumed
7   it would only seem that attrition would
8   be my rightful reward as I continue to
9   consume---while
10   the madhouses, skidrows and graveyards are
11   filled with the likes of
12   me---
13   yet each night as I sit down to this machine
14   with my bottle
15   the poems flare and jump out, on and
16   on---roaring in the glee of
17   easy power: 65 years
18   dancing---my mouth curling into a
19   tiny grin
20   as these keys keep meting out a
21   substantial energy of cock-
22   eyed miracle.


23   the gods have been kind to me through this
24   life-style that would have killed
25   an ox of a man
26   and I'm no ox of a
27   man.


28   I sensed from the beginning, of
29   course, that there was a strange gnawing
30   inside of me

[Page 108 ]


31   but I never dreamed this
32   luck
33   this absolute shot of
34   grace

37   afterthought.

3   I am at the racetrack all day and
4   up here all night with the bottle and
5   this machine.
6   my wife, poor dear, may she find her place

9   the few people that I have

11   little extra flare
12   that inventive humanity, well, they
13   dissolved
14   but
15   being a natural loner
16   I am not over-
17   distraught---
18   there are still my 5

34   well, the competition ain't been

37   wrists: I realized all that
38   long ago while
39   starving and
40   pissing out the
41   window
42   while smashing waterglasses of
43   booze against the behind-in-the-

47   Blob.


48   now Death is a plant growing in my
49   mind


50   not much to hang on to in this early morning growling.


51   I am sad for the dead and I am sad for the living
52   but not for my 5 cats or
53   for my wife, my wife who will
54   find her place in
55   heaven.


56   and as for the people
57   dissolved
58   I didn't dissolve them, they dissolved
59   themselves.

60   and that the sidewalks are empty while
61   full of feet
62   passing---
63   this is the working of the

65   not much to hang on to
66   as
67   a man plays a piano
68   through my radio and
69   the walls
70   stand up and
71   down


72   as the courage of everything

4   the black pimp to get off the phone so I can put through my
5   one
6   allowed call (so many of those a.m.s too) it took

        Bukowski, Charles :  whorehouse [from You Get So Alone At Times
        That It Just Makes Sense (1986) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   my first experience in a whorehouse
2   was in Tijuana.
3   it was a large place on the edge of
4   the city.
5   I was 17, with two friends.
6   we got drunk to get our guts
7   up
8   then went on
9   in.
10   the place was packed with
11   servicemen
12   mostly
13   sailors.
14   the sailors stood in long
15   lines
16   hollering, and beating on
17   the doors.


18   Lance got in a short
19   line (the lines indicated the
20   age of the whore: the shorter the
21   line the older the
22   whore)
23   and got it over
24   with, came out bold and
25   grinning: "well, what you guys
26   waiting for?"


27   the other guy, Jack, he passed me
28   the tequila bottle and I took a
29   hit and passed it back and he
30   took a hit.

[Page 114 ]




31   Lance looked at us: "I'll be
32   in the car, sleeping it
33   off."


34   Jack and I waited until he was
35   gone
36   then started walking toward the
37   exit.
38   Jack was wearing this big
39   sombrero
40   and right at the exit was an
41   old whore sitting in a
42   chair.
43   she stuck out her leg
44   barring our
45   way: "come on, boys, I'll make
46   it /good/ for you and
47   /cheap/ !"


48   somehow that scared the
49   shit out of Jack and he
50   said, "my god, I'm going to
51   PUKE!"


52   "NOT ON THE FLOOR!" screamed
53   the whore
54   and with that
55   Jack ripped off his
56   sombrero
57   and holding it
58   before him
59   he must have puked a
60   gallon.


61   then he just stood there
62   staring down

63   at it
64   and the whore
65   said, "get out of
66   here!"


67   Jack ran out the door with
68   his sombrero
69   and then the whore
70   got a very kind look upon her
71   face and said to me:
72   " /cheap/ !" and I walked
73   into a room with her
74   and there was a big fat man
75   sitting in a chair and
76   I asked her, "who's
77   that?"
78   and she said, "he's here to
79   see that I don't get
80   hurt."


81   and I walked over to the
82   man and said, "hey, how ya
83   doin'?"


84   and he said, "fine,
85   señor ..."


86   and I said,
87   "you live around
88   here?"


89   and he said, "give
90   her the
91   money."


92   "how much?"

[Page 116 ]




93   "two dollars."


94   I gave the lady the two
95   dollars
96   then walked back to the
97   man.


98   "I might come and live
99   in Mexico some day," I
100   told him.


101   "get the hell out of
102   here," he said,
103   "NOW!"


104   as I walked through the
105   exit
106   Jack was waiting out there
107   without his
108   sombrero
109   but he was still
110   wavering
111   drunk.


112   "Christ," I said, "she was
113   /great/ , she actually got my
114   balls into her
115   mouth!"


116   we walked back to the car.
117   Lance was passed out, we
118   awakened him and he drove us
119   out of
120   there

[Page 117 ]




121   somehow
122   we got through the border
123   crossing


124   and all the way
125   driving back to
126   L.A.


127   we rode Jack for being a
128   chickenshit
129   virgin.
130   Lance did it in a gentle
131   manner
132   but I was loud
133   demeaning Jack for his lack of
134   guts
135   and I kept at it
136   until Jack passed out
137   near
138   San Clemente.


139   I sat up there next to
140   Lance as we passed the last
141   tequila bottle back and
142   forth.


143   as Los Angeles rushed toward
144   us
145   Jack asked, "how was
146   it?"
147   and I answered
148   in a worldly
149   tone: "I've had
150   better."

1   the nut in the red outfit
2   came walking down the street
3   talking to himself
4   when a hotshot in a sports car
5   cut into an alley
6   in front of the nut
7   who hollered, "HEY, DOG DRIP!
8   SWINE SHIT! YOU GOT PEANUTS FOR
9   BRAINS?"


10   the hotshot braked his sports
11   car, backed toward the nut,
12   stopped,
13   said: "WHAT'S THAT YOU SAID,
14   BUDDY?"


15   "I said, YOU BETTER
16   DRIVE OFF WHILE YOU CAN,
17   ASSHOLE!"


18   the hotshot had his girl in the
19   car with him and started to
20   open the door.


21   "YOU BETTER NOT GET OUT OF THAT
22   CAR, PEANUT BRAIN!"


23   the door closed and the sports car
24   roared
25   off.


26   the nut in the red outfit then
27   continued to walk down the
28   street.

29   "THERE AIN'T NOTHIN' NOWHERE,"
30   he said, "AND IT'S GETTING TO BE

1   the people are weary, unhappy and frustrated, the people are
2   bitter and vengeful, the people are deluded and fearful, the
3   people are angry and uninventive
4   and I drive among them on the freeway and they project
5   what is left of themselves in their manner of driving---
6   some more hateful, more thwarted than others---
7   some don't like to be passed, some attempt to keep others
8   from passing
9   ---some attempt to block lane changes
10   ---some hate cars of a newer, more expensive model
11   ---others in these cars hate the older cars.


12   the freeway is a circus of cheap and petty emotions, it's
13   humanity on the move, most of them coming from some place
14   they
15   hated and going to another they hate just as much or
16   more.
17   the freeways are a lesson in what we have become and
18   most of the crashes and deaths are the collision
19   of incomplete beings, of pitiful and demented
20   lives.


21   when I drive the freeways I see the soul of humanity of
22   my city and it's ugly, ugly, ugly: the living have choked the
23   heart
24   away.

5   a large portion of my readers want me to

8   also, about being in jails and hospitals, or

12   I agree that complacency hardly engenders an

        Bukowski, Charles :  a funny guy [from You Get So Alone At Times
        That It Just Makes Sense (1986) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   Schopenhauer couldn't abide the masses,
2   they drove him mad
3   but he was able to say,
4   "at least, I am not them."
5   and this consoled him to some
6   extent
7   and I think one of his most humorous writings
8   was when he expostulated against some man who
9   uselessly cracked his whip
10   over his horse
11   completely destroying a thought process
12   Arthur was involved
13   in.


14   but the man with the whip was a part of the
15   whole
16   no matter how seemingly useless and
17   stupid
18   and once great thoughts
19   often with time
20   become useless and
21   stupid.


22   but Schopenhauer's rage was so
23   beautiful
24   so well placed that I laughed
25   out loud
26   then
27   put him down
28   next to Nietzsche
29   who was also
30   all too
31   human.

        Bukowski, Charles :  coffee [from You Get So Alone At Times That

1   I was having a coffee at the
2   counter
3   when a man
4   3 or 4 stools down
5   asked me,
6   "listen, weren't you the
7   guy who was
8   hanging from his
9   heels
10   from that 4th floor
11   hotel room
12   the other
13   night?"


14   "yes," I answered, "that
15   was me."


16   "what made you do
17   that?" he asked.


18   "well, it's pretty
19   involved."


20   he looked away
21   then.


22   the waitress
23   who had been
24   standing there
25   asked me,
26   "he was joking,
27   wasn't
28   he?"

[Page 127 ]




29   "no," I
30   said.


31   I paid, got up, walked
32   to the door, opened
33   it.


34   I heard the man
35   say, "that guy's
36   nuts."


37   out on the street I
38   walked north
39   feeling
40   curiously
41   honored.

1   HEY, I hollered across the
2   room to her,
3   DRINK SOME WINE OUT OF
4   YOUR SHOE!


5   WHY? she
6   screamed.


7   BECAUSE THIS USELESSNESS
8   NEEDS SOME
9   GAMBLE!
10   I yelled
11   back.


12   HEY, the guy in the next
13   apartment beat on the
14   wall, I'VE GOT TO GET UP
15   IN THE MORNING AND GO
16   TO WORK SO FOR CHRIST'S
17   SAKE, SHUT
18   UP!


19   he damn near broke the wall
20   down and had a most
21   powerful
22   voice.


23   I walked over to
24   her, said, listen, let's
25   be quiet, he's got some
26   rights.

[Page 129 ]




27   FUCK YOU, YOU ASSHOLE!
28   she screamed
29   at me.


30   the guy began pounding
31   on the wall
32   again.


33   she was right and he was
34   right.


35   I walked the bottle over
36   to the window and
37   looked out into the
38   night.


39   then I had a good roaring
40   drink
41   and I thought, we are all
42   doomed
43   together, that's all there is
44   to
45   it. (that's all there was
46   to that particular drink, just
47   like all the
48   others.)


49   then I walked
50   back to her and
51   she was asleep in
52   her
53   chair.


54   I carried her to
55   the bed
56   turned out the

[Page 130 ]


57   lights
58   then sat in the
59   chair by the
60   window
61   sucking at the
62   bottle, thinking,
63   well, I've gotten
64   this far
65   and that's
66   plenty.


67   and now
68   she's sleeping
69   and
70   maybe
71   he can
72   too.

1   at one stage in my life
2   I met a man who claimed to have
3   visited Pound at St. Elizabeths.


4   then I met a woman who not only
5   claimed to have visited
6   E.P.
7   but also to have made love
8   to him---she even showed
9   me
10   certain sections in the
11   /Cantos/
12   where Ezra was supposed to have
13   mentioned
14   her.


15   so there was this man and
16   this woman
17   and the woman told me
18   that Pound had never
19   mentioned a visit from this
20   man
21   and the man claimed that the
22   lady had had nothing to do
23   with the
24   master
25   that she was a
26   charlatan.


27   and since I wasn't a
28   Poundian scholar
29   I didn't know who to
30   believe

[Page 134 ]




31   but
32   one thing I do
33   know: when a man is
34   living
35   many claim relationships
36   that are hardly
37   so
38   and after he dies, well,
39   then it's everybody's
40   party.


41   my guess is that Pound
42   knew neither the lady or the
43   gentleman


44   or if he knew
45   one
46   or if he knew
47   both


48   it was a shameful waste of
49   madhouse
50   time.

9   great writer
10   babbling
11   drooling
12   in his little white
13   rat
14   whiskers
15   talking about
16   war
17   talking about the
18   wars
19   talking about the brave

23   the people
24   come into the

1   I can remember starving in a
2   small room in a strange city
3   shades pulled down, listening to
4   classical music
5   I was young I was so young it hurt like a knife
6   inside
7   because there was no alternative except to hide as long
8   as possible---
9   not in self-pity but with dismay at my limited chance:
10   trying to connect.


11   the old composers---Mozart, Bach, Beethoven,
12   Brahms were the only ones who spoke to me and
13   they were dead.


14   finally, starved and beaten, I had to go into
15   the streets to be interviewed for low-paying and
16   monotonous
17   jobs
18   by strange men behind desks
19   men without eyes men without faces
20   who would take my hours
21   break them
22   piss on them.


23   now I work for the editors the readers the
24   critics


25   but still hang around and drink with
26   Mozart, Bach, Brahms and the
27   Bee

29   some men

1   I was writing three short stories a week
2   and sending them to the /Atlantic Monthly/
3   they would all come back.
4   my money went for stamps and envelopes
5   and paper and wine
6   and I got so thin I used to
7   suck my cheeks
8   together
9   and they'd meet over the top of my
10   tongue (that's when I thought about
11   Hamsun's /Hunger/ ---where he ate his own
12   flesh; I once took a bite of my wrist
13   but it was very salty).


14   anyhow, one night in Miami Beach (I
15   have no idea what I was doing in that
16   city) I had not eaten in 60 hours
17   and I took the last of my starving
18   pennies
19   went down to the corner grocery and
20   bought a loaf of bread.
21   I planned to chew each slice slowly---
22   as if each were a slice of turkey
23   or a luscious
24   steak
25   and I got back to my room and
26   opened the wrapper and the
27   slices of bread were green
28   and mouldy.


29   my party was not to be.

[Page 142 ]




30   I just dumped the bread upon the
31   floor
32   and I sat on that bed wondering about
33   the green mould, the
34   decay.


35   my rent money was used up and
36   I listened to all the sounds
37   of all the people in that
38   roominghouse


39   and down on the floor were
40   the dozens of stories with the
41   dozens of /Atlantic Monthly/
42   rejection slips.


43   it was early evening and I
44   turned out the light and
45   went to bed and
46   it wasn't long before I
47   heard the mice coming out,
48   I heard them creeping over my
49   immortal stories and
50   eating the
51   green mouldy bread.


52   and in the morning
53   when I awakened
54   I saw that
55   all that was left of the
56   bread
57   was the green
58   mould.
59   they had eaten right to the
60   edge of the mould
61   leasving chunks of

[Page 143 ]


62   it
63   among the stories and
64   rejection slips
65   as I heard the sound of
66   my landlady's vacuum
67   cleaner
68   bumping down the
69   hall
70   slowly approaching my
71   door.

1   I get these girly magazines in the mail because
2   I'm writing short stories for them again
3   and here in these pages are these ladies
4   exposing their jewel boxes---
5   it looks more like a gynecologist's
6   journal---
7   everything boldly and clinically
8   exposed
9   beneath bland and bored physiognomies.
10   it's a turn-off of gigantic
11   proportions:
12   the secret is in the
13   imagination---
14   take that away and you have dead
15   meat.


16   a century back
17   a man could be driven mad
18   by a well-turned
19   ankle, and
20   why not?
21   one could imagine
22   that the rest
23   would be
24   magical
25   indeed!


26   now they shove it at us like a
27   McDonald's hamburger
28   on a platter.


29   there is hardly anything as beautiful as
30   a woman in a long dress

[Page 146 ]


31   not even the sunrise
32   not even the geese flying south
33   in the long V formation
34   in the bright freshness
35   of early morning.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the passing of a great one [from You Get So
        Alone At Times That It Just Makes Sense (1986) , Black Sparrow
        Press ]



1   he was the only living writer I ever met who I truly
2   admired and he was dying when I met
3   him.
4   (we in this game are shy on praise even toward
5   those who do it very well, but I never had this
6   problem with J.F.)
7   I visited him several times at the
8   hospital (there was never anybody else
9   about) and upon entering his room
10   I was never sure if he was asleep
11   or?


12   "John?"


13   he was stretched there on that bed, blind
14   and amputated:
15   advanced
16   diabetes.


17   "John it's
18   Hank ..."


19   he would answer and then we would talk for
20   a short bit (mostly he would talk and I would
21   listen; after all, he was our mentor, our
22   god):


23   /Ask the Dust/
24   /Wait Until Spring, Bandini/
25   /Dago Red/


26   all the others.

[Page 148 ]




27   to end up in Hollywood writing
28   movie scripts
29   that's what killed
30   him.


31   "the worst thing," he told me,
32   "is bitterness, people end up so
33   bitter."


34   He wasn't bitter, although he had
35   every right to
36   be ...


37   at the funeral I
38   met several of his script-writing
39   buddies.


40   "let's write something about
41   John," one of them
42   suggested.


43   "I don't think I can," I
44   told them.


45   and, of course, they never
46   did.

34   John, meeting you,
35   even the way it
36   was was the event of my
37   life. I can't say
38   I would have died for

1   long ago
2   across from the campus
3   in the malt shop
4   the juke box going
5   the young girls perfectly in tune
6   dancing with the football players
7   and the college bright boys


8   Glenn Miller was the big thing then
9   and everybody stepped
10   almost everybody
11   I sat with a couple of disciples
12   we were supposed to be outlaws
13   the explorers of Truth
14   but I liked the music
15   and the laziness of waiting
16   as the world rushed toward war
17   as Hitler speechified
18   the girls whirled
19   graceful
20   showing leg
21   that last bright sunshine
22   we warmed ourselves in it
23   shutting away everything else
24   while the universe opened its mouth
25   in an attempt to
26   swallow us all.

1   my grandmother always attended the sunrise
2   Easter service
3   and the Rose Bowl
4   parade.


5   she also liked to go to the
6   beach, sit on those benches
7   facing the sea.


8   she thought movies were
9   sinful.


10   she ate enormous platefuls of
11   food.


12   she prayed for me
13   constantly.


14   "poor boy: the devil is inside
15   of you."


16   she said the devil was
17   inside her husband
18   too.


19   though not divorced
20   they lived
21   separately
22   and had not seen each
23   other
24   for 15 years.

[Page 154 ]




25   she said that hospitals were
26   nonsense


27   she never used them
28   or
29   the doctors.


30   at 87
31   she died one evening
32   while feeding her
33   canary.


34   she liked to
35   drop the seed
36   into the cage
37   while making these
38   little
39   bird sounds.


40   she wasn't very
41   interesting
42   but few people
43   are.

1   in addition to the envy and the rancor of some of
2   my peers
3   there is the other thing, it comes by telephone and
4   letter: "you are the world's greatest living
5   writer."


6   this doesn't please me either because somehow
7   I believe that to be the world's greatest living
8   writer
9   there must be something
10   terribly wrong with you.


11   I don't even want to be the world's greatest
12   dead writer.


13   just being dead would be fair
14   enough.


15   also, the word "writer" is a very tiresome
16   word.


17   just think how much more pleasing it would be
18   to hear:
19   you are the world's greatest pool
20   player
21   or
22   you are the world's greatest
23   fucker
24   or
25   you are the world's greatest
26   horseplayer.

28   that
29   would really make

        Bukowski, Charles :  invasion [from You Get So Alone At Times
        That It Just Makes Sense (1986) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I didn't know that
2   there was anything
3   in the closet
4   although some nights
5   my sleep would be
6   interrupted by strange
7   rumblings
8   but
9   I always thought
10   these to be
11   minor
12   quakes.


13   the closet was
14   the one
15   down the hall
16   and
17   was seldom
18   used.


19   the curious thing
20   for me
21   was that
22   the cats
23   (I had 4 of
24   them)
25   appeared to be
26   leaving
27   large
28   droppings
29   about
30   (and

[Page 158 ]


31   they were
32   house-broken).


33   then
34   the cats
35   vanished
36   one by
37   one
38   but the fresh
39   droppings
40   kept
41   appearing.


42   it was one night
43   while I was
44   reading the
45   stock market
46   quotations
47   that I
48   looked up


49   and
50   there stood
51   the
52   lion
53   in the bedroom
54   doorway.


55   I was
56   in bed
57   propped up
58   with a
59   couple of
60   pillows
61   and drinking a

[Page 159 ]


62   hot
63   chocolate.


64   now
65   nobody
66   can believe
67   a lion
68   in a
69   bedroom---
70   at least
71   not
72   in a city
73   of any
74   size.


75   so
76   I just kept
77   looking at the
78   lion
79   and not
80   quite
81   believing.


82   then
83   it turned and
84   walked down the
85   stairway.


86   I
87   followed it---
88   a good
89   18 feet
90   behind---
91   clutching my
92   baseball bat

[Page 160 ]


93   in one
94   hand
95   and my
96   4-inch knife
97   in the
98   other.


99   I watched the
100   lion
101   go down the
102   stairway
103   then walk
104   across the front
105   room


106   it paused
107   before the large
108   plate glass
109   sliding
110   doors
111   which faced the
112   yard and the
113   street.


114   they were
115   closed.


116   the lion
117   emitted an
118   impatient
119   growl


120   and
121   leaped through the
122   glass

[Page 161 ]


123   crashing through
124   into the
125   night.


126   I sat
127   on the couch
128   in the
129   dark
130   still unable
131   to believe
132   what
133   I had
134   seen.


135   then
136   I heard
137   a scream
138   of such utter
139   agony and
140   terror
141   that
142   for a
143   moment
144   I could
145   neither
146   see
147   breathe nor
148   comprehend.


149   I rose,
150   turned to
151   barricade myself
152   in the
153   bedroom

[Page 162 ]


154   only to see
155   3 small
156   lion cubs
157   trundling
158   down
159   the stairway---
160   cute
161   devilish
162   felines


163   as the
164   mother
165   returned
166   through the
167   night and the
168   shattered glass
169   door


170   half dragging
171   half carrying
172   a bloodied
173   man
174   across the
175   rug
176   leaving a
177   red
178   trail


179   the cubs
180   rushed
181   forward
182   and the
183   moon
184   came through
185   to light

[Page 163 ]


186   the
187   whirling
188   feast.

1   as I got out of my car down at the docks
2   two men started walking toward
3   me.
4   one looked old and mean and the other was
5   big and smiling.
6   they were both wearing
7   caps.
8   they kept walking toward me.
9   I got ready.


10   "something bothering you guys?"


11   "no," said the old
12   guy.
13   they both stopped.
14   "don't you remember us?"


15   "I'm not sure ..."


16   "we painted your house."


17   "oh, yeah ... come on, I'll buy you a
18   beer ..."


19   we walked toward a cafe.


20   "you were one of the nicest guys we ever
21   worked for ..."


22   "yeah?"


23   "yeah, you kept bringing us beer ..."

[Page 165 ]




24   we sat at one of those rough tables
25   overlooking the harbor. we
26   sucked at our
27   beers.


28   "you still live with that young
29   woman?" asked the old
30   guy.


31   "yeah. how you guys doing?"


32   "there's no work now ..."


33   I took out a ten and handed it to the old
34   one.


35   "listen, I forgot to tip you guys ..."


36   "thanks."


37   we sat with our beer.
38   the canneries had shut down.
39   Todd Shipyard had failed
40   and was
41   phasing them
42   out.
43   San Pedro was back in the
44   30's.


45   I finished my beer.


46   "well, you guys, I gotta go."


47   "where ya gonna go?"


48   "gonna buy some fish ..."

[Page 166 ]




49   I walked off toward the fish market,
50   turned halfway there
51   gave them
52   thumb-up
53   right hand.


54   they both took their caps off and
55   waved them.
56   I laughed, turned, walked
57   off.


58   sometimes it's hard to know
59   what to
60   do.


[Page 167 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  longshot [from You Get So Alone At Times
        That It Just Makes Sense (1986) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   of course, I had lost much blood
2   maybe it was a different kind of
3   dying
4   but I still had enough left to wonder
5   about
6   the absence of fear.


7   it was going to be easy: they had
8   put me in a special ward they had
9   in that place
10   for the poor who were
11   dying.
12   ---the doors were a little thicker
13   ---the windows a little smaller
14   and there was much
15   wheeling in and out of
16   bodies
17   plus
18   the presence of the priest
19   giving last
20   rites.


21   you saw the priest all the time
22   but you seldom saw a
23   doctor.


24   it was always nice to see a
25   nurse---
26   they rather took the place of
27   angels
28   for those who
29   believed in that sort of
30   thing.

[Page 168 ]




31   the priest kept bugging me.


32   "no offense, Father, but I'd
33   rather die without
34   it," I whispered.


35   "but on your entrance application you
36   stated 'Catholic.'"


37   "that was just to be
38   social ..."


39   "my son, once a Catholic, always a
40   Catholic!"


41   "Father," I whispered, "that's not
42   true ..."


43   the nicest thing about the place were
44   the Mexican girls who came in to
45   change the sheets, they giggled, they
46   joked with the dying and
47   they were
48   beautiful.


49   and the worst thing was
50   the Salvation Army Band who
51   came around at
52   5:30 a.m.
53   Easter Morning
54   and gave us the old
55   religious feeling---horns and drums
56   and all, much
57   brass and
58   pounding, tremendous volume

[Page 169 ]


59   there were 40 or so
60   in that room
61   and that band
62   stiffened a good
63   10 or 15 of us by
64   6 a.m.


65   and they rolled them right out
66   to the morgue elevator
67   over to the west, a very
68   busy elevator.


69   I stayed in Death's waiting room for
70   3 days.
71   I watched them roll out close to
72   fifty.


73   they finally got tired of waiting
74   for me
75   and rolled me
76   out of there.


77   a nice black homosexual fellow
78   pushed me
79   along.


80   "you want to know the odds of
81   coming out of that ward?"
82   he asked.


83   "yeah."


84   "50 to one."

[Page 170 ]




85   "hell,
86   got any
87   smokes?"


88   "no, but I can get you
89   some."


90   we rolled along
91   as the sun managed to come through the
92   wire-webbed windows
93   and I began to think of
94   that first drink when
95   I got
96   out.


[Page 171 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  concrete [from You Get So Alone At Times

1   he had set up the
2   reading


3   he was one of the foremost practitioners
4   of concrete poetry
5   and after I read I went
6   up there to where he
7   lived


8   his place was high in the
9   mountains and
10   we drank and looked out the large
11   window at very large
12   birds
13   flying about


14   gliding mostly


15   he said they were eagles
16   (he might have been putting me
17   on)


18   and his wife played the
19   piano


20   a bit of
21   Brahms


22   he didn't talk
23   much


24   he was a concrete
25   man

[Page 172 ]




26   his wife was very
27   beautiful


28   and the way the eagles
29   glided


30   that was very beautiful
31   also


32   then it was twilight


33   then it was night


34   and you couldn't see the eagles
35   anymore


36   it had been an afternoon
37   reading


38   we drank until one
39   a.m.


40   then I got into my car
41   and drove the winding
42   narrow road


43   d
44   o
45   w
46   n


47   I was too drunk to fear the
48   danger


49   when I got to my place I
50   drank two bottles of

[Page 173 ]


51   beer and went to
52   bed.


53   then the phone
54   rang


55   it was my
56   girlfriend


57   she had been calling all
58   night


59   she was angry


60   she accused me of fornicating with
61   another


62   I told her about the beautiful
63   eagles


64   how they glided


65   and that I had been with a concrete
66   man


67   bullshit
68   she said
69   and hung
70   up


71   I stretched out there
72   looked at the ceiling and
73   wondered what the eagles
74   ate

[Page 174 ]




75   then the phone rang
76   again


77   and she asked


78   did the concrete man have a
79   concrete wife and did you stick you
80   dick in her?


81   no
82   I answered
83   I fucked an
84   eagle


85   she hung up
86   again


87   concrete poetry
88   I thought
89   what the hell is
90   it?


91   then I went to sleep and I
92   slept and I
93   slept.

1   the cafes in Paris are just like you imagine
2   they are:
3   very well-dressed people, snobs, and
4   the snob-waiter comes up and takes your
5   order
6   as if you were a
7   leper.
8   but after you get your wine
9   you feel better
10   you begin to feel like a snob
11   yourself
12   and you give the guy at the next table
13   a sidelong glance
14   he catches you and
15   you twitch your nose
16   a bit as if you had just smelled
17   dogshit
18   then you
19   look away.


20   and the food
21   when it arrives
22   is always too mild.
23   the French are delicate with their
24   spices.


25   and
26   as you eat and drink
27   you realize that everybody is
28   terrorized:


29   too bad
30   too bad

[Page 176 ]


31   such a lovely city
32   full of
33   cowards.


34   then
35   more wine brings more
36   realization:
37   Paris is the world and the world
38   is
39   Paris.


40   drink to it
41   and
42   because of
43   it.

        [from You Get So Alone At Times That It Just Makes Sense (1986)
        , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I used to drink with Jane
2   every night
3   until two or
4   three
5   a.m.


6   and I had to
7   report for
8   work
9   at 5:30
10   a.m.


11   one morning
12   I was sitting
13   casing mail
14   next to this
15   healthy
16   religious
17   fellow


18   and he said,
19   "hey, I /smell/
20   something, don't
21   you?"


22   I answered in the
23   negative.


24   "actually," he said,
25   "it smells something
26   like
27   gasoline."

[Page 178 ]




28   "well," I told
29   him, "don't light a
30   match or
31   I might
32   explode."

        Bukowski, Charles :  the blade [from You Get So Alone At Times
        That It Just Makes Sense (1986) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   there was no parking near the post office where
2   I worked at night
3   so I found this splendid spot
4   (nobody seemed to care to park there)
5   on a dirt road behind a
6   slaughterhouse
7   and as I sat in my car
8   just before work
9   smoking a last cigarette
10   I was treated to the same
11   scene
12   as each evening tailed off into
13   night---
14   the pigs were herded out of the
15   yard pens
16   and onto runways
17   by a man making pig sounds and
18   flapping a large canvas
19   and the pigs ran wildly
20   up the runway
21   toward the waiting
22   blade,
23   and many evenings
24   after watching that
25   after finishing my
26   smoke
27   I just started the car
28   backed out of there and
29   drove away from my
30   job.


31   my absenteeism reached such astonishing
32   proportions

[Page 180 ]


33   that I had to finally
34   park
35   at some expense
36   behind a Chinese bar
37   where all I could see were tiny shuttered
38   windows
39   with neon signs advertising some
40   oriental
41   libation.


42   it seemed less real, and that was
43   what was
44   needed.


[Page 181 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  the boil [from You Get So Alone At Times
        That It Just Makes Sense (1986) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I was making good with the girls on the assembly line at
2   Nabisco, I had recently beaten up the company
3   bully
4   on my lunch hour,
5   things were going well, I was from out of
6   town, the stranger who seldom spoke to
7   anybody, I was the mystery man, I was the
8   cool number,
9   almost all those fillies had an interest
10   in me
11   and the guys didn't know
12   what the hell.


13   then one morning I awakened in my
14   room
15   with a huge boil on the side of
16   my head (right cheek)
17   and
18   it was damn near the size of a
19   golf ball.


20   I should have phoned in sick
21   but
22   I didn't have the sense and
23   went on in
24   anyhow.


25   it made a difference: the women's eyes
26   fell away from mine, and the guys
27   no longer acted fearful
28   and I felt defeated by
29   fate.

[Page 182 ]




30   the boil remained
31   for
32   2 days
33   3 days
34   4 days.


35   on the 5th day the foreman handed me
36   my papers: "we're cutting back, you're
37   finished."


38   this was one hour before
39   lunch.


40   I walked to my locker, opened it,
41   took off my apron and cap
42   threw them in there
43   along with the
44   key
45   and walked
46   out


47   a truly horrible walk
48   to the street
49   where I turned around
50   and looked back at the building
51   feeling as if they had
52   discovered
53   something
54   hideously indecent
55   about me.


[Page 183 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  not listed [from You Get So Alone At Times
        That It Just Makes Sense (1986) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   my horse was the grey
2   a 4 to one shot
3   with early lick
4   and he had a length and
5   a half
6   3/4's of the way
7   down the stretch
8   when his left front leg
9   snapped
10   and he tumbled
11   tossing the jock
12   over his neck and
13   head.
14   luckily
15   the field avoided both
16   the horse and the
17   jock---who
18   got up and limped away
19   from the kicking
20   animal.


21   accident potential:
22   that's something
23   that's not listed in
24   the Racing Form.


25   in the clubhouse
26   I saw Harry
27   standing in a far-
28   off corner.
29   he was an x-jock's
30   agent
31   now working as a

[Page 184 ]


32   trainer
33   but not having
34   too many mounts
35   to train.


36   he was behind his
37   dark shades
38   looking
39   awful.


40   "you have the grey?"
41   I asked.


42   "yeah," he said,
43   "heavy ..."


44   "you need a transfusion,
45   it's not much but ..."


46   I slipped
47   3 folded 20's
48   into his coat
49   pocket.


50   "thanks," he
51   said.


52   "put it on a good one."


53   Harry had done me some
54   nice things
55   and anyhow
56   he was one of the
57   best
58   working for an edge
59   in one of the bloodiest

60   rackets
61   around: we are trying to
62   beat the percentages
63   and each day
64   some must fall
65   so that
66   others can go
67   on. (the track is just
68   like anyplace else
69   only there
70   it usually happens
71   more
72   quickly.)


73   I walked over and got
74   a coffee.
75   I liked the next
76   race
77   a six furlong affair for
78   non-winners of
79   two.


80   one good hit
81   would put the gods in
82   place
83   and cure
84   everything
85   in a flash of
86   glory ...

1   more and more
2   I get letters from
3   young ladies:

8   I'm a good housekeeper

        Bukowski, Charles :  the lady in the castle [from You Get So
        Alone At Times That It Just Makes Sense (1986) , Black Sparrow
        Press ]



1   she lived in this house
2   that looked like a
3   castle
4   and when you got inside
5   the ceilings were so very
6   high
7   and I was poor
8   and it all rather
9   fascinated
10   me.


11   she
12   was no longer
13   young
14   but she had
15   masses
16   of hair
17   that damn near
18   went down to her
19   ankles
20   and
21   I thought about
22   how strange
23   it would be
24   doing it
25   with all that
26   hair.


27   I drove up there
28   several times
29   in my old
30   car
31   and she had fine

[Page 190 ]


32   liquors to
33   drink
34   and we sat
35   but I could
36   never quite get
37   near her
38   and though I didn't
39   push at
40   it
41   something about
42   not
43   connecting
44   /did/ offend my
45   ego
46   for ugly as I was
47   I had always been
48   lucky with the
49   ladies.


50   it confused me
51   and I suppose
52   I needed
53   that.


54   she liked to
55   talk about
56   the arts and
57   about
58   film making
59   and listening
60   to all that
61   only made me
62   drink
63   more.

[Page 191 ]




64   I
65   finally
66   just
67   gave her
68   up
69   and a good year
70   or so
71   went by
72   when
73   one night
74   the phone
75   rang: it was the
76   lady.


77   "I want to come see
78   you," she said.


79   "I'm writing now, I'm
80   hot ... I can't see
81   anybody ..."


82   "I just want to come
83   by, I won't bother you,
84   I'll just sit on the couch,
85   I'll sleep on the couch, I
86   won't bother you ..."


87   "NO! JESUS CHRIST, I
88   CAN'T SEE ANYBODY!"


89   I hung up.


90   the lady who was /actually/
91   on the couch
92   said, "oh, you're all
93   SOFT now!"

[Page 192 ]




94   "yeah."


95   "come here ..."


96   she took my penis
97   in her hand
98   flicked out her
99   tongue
100   then
101   stopped.


102   "what are you writing?"


103   "nothing ... I've got writer's
104   block ..."


105   "sure you have ... your pipes are
106   clogged ... you need to get
107   cleaned out ..."


108   then she had me in her
109   mouth


110   and then the phone rang
111   again ...


112   in a fury
113   I ran over to the
114   phone
115   picked it
116   up.


117   it was the lady in the
118   castle:

[Page 193 ]


119   "listen, I won't bother you,
120   you won't even know I'm
121   there ..."


122   "YOU WHORE, I'M GETTING A
123   BLOW JOB!"


124   I hung up and
125   turned back.


126   the other lady was walking
127   toward the
128   door.


129   "what'sa matter?" I
130   asked.


131   "I can't STAND that
132   term!"


133   "what term?"


134   "BLOW JOB!" she
135   screamed.


136   she slammed the door and
137   was gone ...



138   I walked to where the
139   typewriter sat
140   put a new piece of paper
141   in there.
142   it was one
143   a.m.

[Page 194 ]




144   I sat there and
145   drank scotch and
146   beer chasers
147   smoked cheap
148   cigars.


149   3:15 a.m.
150   I was still sitting
151   there
152   re-lighting old
153   cigar stubs and
154   drinking ale.


155   the new
156   piece of paper was still
157   unused.


158   I switched out the
159   lights
160   worked my way toward
161   the bedroom
162   got myself on the
163   bed
164   clothes still
165   on


166   I could hear the toilet
167   running
168   but couldn't get up
169   to tap the handle
170   to end that
171   sound


172   my god damned pipes were
173   clogged.

1   they're not going to let you
2   sit at a front table
3   at some cafe in Europe
4   in the mid-afternoon sun.
5   if you do, somebody's going to
6   drive by and
7   spray your guts with a
8   submachine gun.


9   they're not going to let you
10   feel good
11   for very long
12   anywhere.
13   the forces aren't going to
14   let you sit around
15   fucking-off and
16   relaxing.
17   you've got to do it
18   their way.


19   the unhappy, the bitter and
20   the vengeful
21   need their
22   fix---which is
23   you or somebody

25   in agony, or
26   better yet
27   dead, dropped into some
28   hole.


29   as long as there are
30   human beings about

37   escape to).


38   all you can do
39   is maybe grab
40   ten lucky minutes
41   here
42   or maybe an hour
43   there.


44   something
45   is working toward you
46   right now, and

48   and nobody but
49   you.

3   but they've made a
4   tv adaptation of the

6   and it's been running
7   for several
8   nights
9   and I have spent
10   ten minutes
11   here and there
12   watching the troubles of
13   the rich
14   while they are leaning
15   against their beach chairs
16   in Nice
17   or walking about their
18   large rooms
19   drink in hand while
20   making
21   philosophical

23   or
24   fucking up
25   at the
26   dinner party
27   or the
28   dinner dance
29   they really have no
30   /idea/
31   of what to do with
32   themselves:
33   swim?

[Page 198 ]


34   tennis?
35   drive up the
36   coast?
37   down the
38   coast?
39   find
40   new beds?
41   lose old
42   ones?
43   or
44   fuck with the
45   arts and the
46   artists?


47   having nothing to struggle
48   against
49   they have nothing to struggle
50   for.


51   the rich are different
52   all right


53   so is the ring-

56   sand
57   flea.

10   up ...

37   I can come up with is
38   that
39   I must have some
40   great motherfucking

48   my balls


49   themselves.

1   we were standing around
2   at this birthday party
3   at this fancy
4   restaurant


5   and
6   many
7   special people were
8   about
9   preening their
10   fame.


11   I wanted to run
12   out


13   when a man
14   standing near by
15   said something
16   exactly appropriate
17   to the
18   occasion.


19   "hey," I said to
20   my wife, "this
21   guy's got
22   something. when we are
23   seated
24   let's try to
25   sit next to
26   him."


27   we did and as
28   the drinks were

[Page 202 ]


29   poured
30   the man began
31   talking


32   he began on a
33   long story
34   which was
35   building toward a
36   punch
37   line.


38   my problem was that
39   I could guess
40   what the
41   punch line
42   was
43   going to
44   be.


45   and
46   he talked
47   on and
48   on


49   then
50   dropped the
51   line.


52   "shit," I
53   told him, "that
54   was
55   awful, you've
56   really
57   disappointed
58   me ..."

[Page 203 ]




59   he
60   only began
61   on another
62   story.



63   I walked over to
64   another table
65   and stood behind
66   the now
67   great
68   movie star.


69   "listen,
70   when I first met
71   you
72   you were just a nice
73   German boy.
74   now
75   you've turned into
76   a
77   conceited
78   prick. you've
79   really
80   disappointed
81   me."


82   the great movie
83   star (who was a
84   man
85   mighty of
86   muscle) growled
87   and
88   shook his
89   shoulders.

[Page 204 ]




90   then I walked over to
91   the table
92   where the birthday lady
93   sat
94   surrounded by
95   all these
96   media
97   folk.


98   "looking at you
99   people," I said, "makes
100   me feel like
101   vomiting
102   all over
103   your
104   inept
105   plausibilities!"


106   "oh," said the lady
107   to her
108   guests, "he
109   /always/ talks
110   that
111   way!"


112   and she gave a
113   laugh, poor
114   dear.


115   so
116   I said, "Happy
117   birthday,
118   but
119   I warned you
120   never to

[Page 205 ]


121   invite me to these
122   things."


123   then
124   I walked back to
125   my table


126   motioned the waiter
127   for
128   another
129   drink.


130   the man
131   was telling
132   another
133   story


134   but
135   it was not
136   nearly
137   as good
138   as


139   this
140   one.

1   when we were kids

        Bukowski, Charles :  the beautiful lady editor [from You Get So
        Alone At Times That It Just Makes Sense (1986) , Black Sparrow
        Press ]



1   she was a beautiful woman, I used to see photographs of
2   her in the literary magazines of that
3   day.


4   I was young but always alone---I felt that I needed the
5   time to get something done and the only way I could buy time
6   was with
7   poverty.


8   I worked not so much with craft but more with getting down
9   what was edging me toward madness---and I had
10   flashes of luck, but it was hardly a pleasurable
11   existence.


12   I think I showed a fine endurance but slowly then
13   health and courage began to leak away.


14   and the night arrived when everything fell apart---and
15   fear, doubt, humiliation entered ...


16   and I wrote a number of letters using my last stamps
17   telling a few select people that I had made a
18   mistake, that I was starving and trapped in a small
19   freezing shack of darkness in a strange city in
20   a strange
21   state.


22   I mailed the letters and then I waited long wild days and
23   nights, hoping, yearning at last for a decent
24   response.


25   only two letters ever arrived---on the same day---
26   and I opened the pages and shook the pages looking for

[Page 209 ]


27   money but there was
28   none.


29   one letter was from my father, a six-pager telling me that
30   I deserved what was happening, that I should have become
31   an engineer like he told me, and that nobody would ever read
32   the kind of stuff I wrote, and on and on, like
33   that.


34   the other letter was from the beautiful lady editor, neatly typed
35   on
36   expensive stationery, and she said that she was no longer
37   publishing her literary magazine, that she had found God and
38   was
39   living in a castle on a hill in Italy and helping the poor, and
40   she signed her famous name, with a "God Bless you," and that
41   was
42   that.


43   ah, you have no idea, in that dark freezing shack, how much I
44   wanted to
45   be poor in Italy instead of Atlanta, to be a poor peasant,
46   yes, or even a dog on her bedspread, or even a flea on that
47   dog on that
48   bedspread: how much I wanted the tiniest
49   warmth.


50   the lady had published me along with Henry Miller, Sartre,
51   Celine,
52   others.


53   I should never have asked for money in a world where millions
54   of
55   peasants were crawling the starving
56   streets

[Page 210 ]


57   and even some years later when the lady editor
58   died
59   I still thought her
60   beautiful.

1   when
2   the cop pulled me
3   over
4   I
5   handed him my
6   license.
7   he
8   went back
9   to radio in
10   the make
11   and model
12   of my car
13   and
14   get clearance on
15   my plates.


16   he wrote
17   the ticket
18   walked
19   up
20   handed it
21   to me
22   to
23   sign.


24   I did
25   he gave
26   me
27   back the
28   license.


29   "how come
30   you

[Page 213 ]


31   don't
32   say
33   anything?"
34   he asked.


35   I shrugged
36   my
37   shoulders.


38   "well, sir,"
39   he
40   said, "have
41   a
42   good day
43   and
44   drive
45   carefully."


46   I
47   noticed
48   some sweat
49   on his
50   brow
51   and the
52   hand
53   that held
54   the
55   ticket
56   seemed to
57   be
58   trembling
59   or
60   perhaps
61   I
62   was only
63   imagining it?

[Page 214 ]




64   anyhow
65   I
66   watched him
67   move
68   toward
69   his
70   bike
71   then I
72   pulled
73   away ...


74   when confronted
75   with
76   dutiful
77   policemen
78   or
79   women
80   in rancor
81   I
82   have nothing
83   to
84   say
85   to them


86   for
87   if I
88   truly
89   began
90   it would
91   end
92   in
93   somebody's
94   death:
95   theirs or
96   mine

[Page 215 ]




97   so
98   I
99   let them
100   have
101   their
102   little
103   victories
104   which
105   they need
106   far
107   more
108   than
109   I
110   do.

1   I can still see us
2   together
3   back then
4   sitting by the river
5   while shit-
6   faced on the
7   grape
8   and playing with the

27   "what have you
28   done?" I
29   ask him.

[Page 217 ]




30   Li passes the
31   bottle: "they are
32   going to end
33   no matter what
34   happens ..."


35   I drink to his
36   knowledge
37   pass the bottle
38   back


39   sit tightly upon my
40   poems
41   which I have
42   jammed halfway up my
43   crotch


44   I help him burn
45   some more of his
46   poesy


47   they float well
48   down
49   the river
50   lighting up the
51   night
52   as good words
53   should.

        Bukowski, Charles :  song [from You Get So Alone At Times That
        It Just Makes Sense (1986) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   Julio came by with his guitar and sang his
2   latest song.
3   Julio was famous, he wrote songs and also
4   published books of little drawings and
5   poems.
6   they were very
7   good.


8   Julio sang a song about his latest love
9   affair.
10   he sang that
11   it began so well
12   then it went to
13   hell.


14   those were not the words exactly
15   but that was the meaning of the
16   words.


17   Julio finished
18   singing.


19   then he said, "I still care for
20   her, I can't get her off my
21   mind."


22   "what will I do?" Julio
23   asked.


24   "drink," Henry said,
25   pouring.

[Page 219 ]




26   Julio just looked at his
27   glass:
28   "I wonder what she's doing
29   now?"


30   "probably engaging in oral
31   copulation," Henry
32   suggested.


33   Julio put his guitar back in
34   the case and
35   walked to the
36   door.


37   Henry walked Julio to his car which
38   was parked in the
39   drive.


40   it was a nice moonlit
41   night.


42   as Julio started his car and
43   backed out the drive
44   Henry waved him a
45   farewell.


46   then he went inside
47   sat
48   down.


49   he finished Julio's untouched
50   drink
51   then he
52   phoned
53   her.

[Page 220 ]




54   "he was just by," Henry told
55   her, "he's feeling very
56   bad ..."


57   "you'll have to excuse me,"
58   she said, "but I'm busy right
59   now."


60   she hung
61   up.


62   and Henry poured one of his
63   own
64   as outside the crickets sang
65   their own
66   song.

        Bukowski, Charles :  practice [from You Get So Alone At Times

1   in that depression neighborhood I had two buddies
2   Eugene and Frank
3   and I had wild fist fights with each of
4   them
5   once or twice a week.
6   the fights lasted 3 or 4 hours and we came out
7   with
8   smashed noses, fattened lips, black eyes, sprained
9   wrists, bruised knuckles, purple
10   welts.


11   our parents said nothing, let us fight on and
12   on
13   watching disinterestedly and
14   finally going back to their newspapers
15   or their radios or their thwarted sex lives,
16   they only became angry if we tore or ruined our
17   clothing, and for that and only for that.


18   but Eugene and Frank and I
19   we had some good work-outs
20   we rumbled through the evenings, crashing through
21   hedges, fighting along the asphalt, over the
22   curbings and into strange front and backyards of
23   unknown homes, the dogs barking, the people screaming at
24   us.
25   we were
26   maniacal, we never quit until the call for supper
27   which none of us could afford to
28   miss.


29   anyhow, Eugene became a Commander in the

[Page 222 ]


30   Navy and Frank became a Supreme Court Justice, State of
31   California and I fiddled with the
32   poem.

        Bukowski, Charles :  love poem to a stripper [from You Get So
        Alone At Times That It Just Makes Sense (1986) , Black Sparrow
        Press ]



1   50 years ago I watched the girls
2   shake it and strip
3   at The Burbank and The Follies
4   and it was very sad
5   and very dramatic
6   as the light turned from green to
7   purple to pink
8   and the music was loud and
9   vibrant,
10   now I sit here tonight
11   smoking and
12   listening to classical
13   music
14   but I still remember some of
15   their names: Darlene, Candy, Jeanette
16   and Rosalie.
17   Rosalie was the
18   best, she knew how,
19   and we twisted in our seats and
20   made sounds
21   as Rosalie brought magic
22   to the lonely
23   so long ago.


24   now Rosalie
25   either so very old or
26   so quiet under the
27   earth,
28   this is the pimple-faced
29   kid
30   who lied about his
31   age

[Page 224 ]


32   just to watch
33   you.


34   you were good, Rosalie
35   in 1935,
36   good enough to remember
37   now
38   when the light is
39   yellow
40   and the nights are
41   slow.

        Bukowski, Charles :  my buddy [from You Get So Alone At Times
        That It Just Makes Sense (1986) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   for a 21-year-old boy in New Orleans I wasn't worth
2   much: I had a dark small room that smelled of
3   piss and death
4   yet I just wanted to stay in there, and there were
5   two lively girls down at the end of the hall who
6   kept knocking on my door and yelling, "Get up!
7   There are good things out here!"


8   "Go away," I told them, but that only goaded
9   them on, they left notes under my door and
10   scotch-taped flowers to the
11   doorknob.


12   I was on cheap wine and green beer and
13   dementia ...


14   I got to know the old guy in the next
15   room, somehow I felt old like
16   him; his feet and ankles were swollen and he couldn't
17   lace his shoes.


18   each day about one p.m. we went for a walk
19   together and it was a very slow
20   walk: each step was painful for
21   him.


22   as we came to the curbing I helped him
23   up and down
24   gripping him by an elbow
25   and the back of his
26   belt, we made it.

[Page 226 ]




27   I liked him: he never questioned me about
28   what I was or wasn't
29   doing.


30   he should have been my father, and I liked
31   best what he said over and
32   over: "Nothing is worth
33   it."


34   he was a
35   sage.


36   those young girls should have
37   left him the
38   notes and the
39   flowers.

        Bukowski, Charles :  Jon Edgar Webb [from You Get So Alone At
        Times That It Just Makes Sense (1986) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I had a lyric poem period down in New Orleans, pounding
2   out these fat rolling lines and
3   drinking gallons of beer.
4   it felt good like screaming in a madhouse, the madhouse of
5   my world
6   as the mice scattered among the
7   empties.
8   at times I went into the bars
9   but I couldn't work it out with those people who sat on the
10   stools:
11   men evaded me and the women were terrified of
12   me.
13   bartenders asked that I
14   leave.
15   I did, struggling back with wondrous six-packs
16   to the room and the mice and those fat rolling
17   lines.


18   that lyric poem period was a raving bitch of a
19   time
20   and there was an editor right around the
21   corner who
22   fed each page into a waiting press, rejecting
23   nothing
24   even though I was unknown
25   he printed me upon ravenous paper
26   manufactured to last
27   2,000 years.


28   this editor who was also the publisher and
29   the printer
30   kept a straight face as I handed him the ten to
31   twenty pages

[Page 228 ]


32   each morning:
33   "is that all?"


34   that crazy son of a bitch, he was a lyric
35   poem
36   himself.

1   some want me to go on writing about whores
2   and puking.


3   others say that type of thing disgusts
4   them.


5   well, I don't miss the
6   whores


7   although now and then one or another makes an
8   attempt to locate
9   me.


10   I don't know if they miss all the booze and
11   the bit of money I gave them


12   or if they are enthralled at the way
13   I've immortalized them in
14   literature.


15   anyhow, they must now make do with
16   whatever men
17   they are able to scrounge
18   up.


19   ---those poor darlings had no
20   idea ...


21   and neither did I
22   that those ugly roaring nights
23   would be fodder

[Page 230 ]


24   such as even
25   Dostoevski
26   would not shy away
27   from.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the magic curse [from You Get So Alone At

1   I never liked skid-row and so I stayed away from the soup
2   kitchens, the bloodbanks and all the so-called hand-
3   outs.


4   I got so god damned thin that if
5   I turned sidewise it was hard to see my shadow under a
6   hard noon sun.


7   it didn't matter to me so long as I stayed away from the
8   crowd


9   and even down there it was a
10   successful and an unsuccessful
11   crowd.


12   I don't think I was insane
13   but many of the
14   insane think
15   that


16   but I think
17   now
18   if anything saved me
19   it was the avoidance of the
20   crowd


21   it was my
22   food


23   still
24   is.

[Page 232 ]




25   get me in a room with more than
26   3 people
27   I tend to act
28   ill
29   odd.


30   I once
31   even asked my wife: look, I must be
32   sick ... perhaps I ought to see a
33   shrink?


34   Christ, I said, he might cure me
35   and then what would I
36   do?


37   she just looked at me
38   and we forgot the
39   whole
40   thing.

        Times That It Just Makes Sense (1986) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   after you've pulled off the tablecloth with
2   the full plates of food
3   and broken the windows
4   and rung the bells of
5   idiots
6   and have
7   spoken true and terrible
8   words
9   and have
10   chased the mob through the
11   doorway---
12   then comes the great and
13   peaceful moment: sitting alone
14   and
15   pouring that quiet drink.


16   the world is better without
17   them.


18   only the plants and the animals are
19   true comrades.


20   I drink to them and with
21   them.


22   they wait as I fill their
23   glasses.

1   Faulkner loved his whiskey
2   and along with the
3   writing
4   he didn't have
5   time
6   for much
7   else.


8   he didn't open
9   most of his
10   mail


11   just held it up
12   to the light


13   and if it didn't
14   contain a
15   check


16   he trashed
17   it.

1   the best part was
2   pulling down the
3   shades
4   stuffing the doorbell
5   with rags
6   putting the phone
7   in the
8   refrigerator
9   and going to bed
10   for 3 or 4
11   days.


12   and the next best
13   part
14   was
15   nobody ever
16   missed
17   me.

2   and some days we all get
3   along.


4   some days I have trouble with
5   one of the
6   cats.


7   other days I have trouble with
8   two of the
9   cats.


10   other days,

12   some days I have trouble with

17   ten eyes looking at me
18   as if I was a dog.

1   she's whistling and clapping
2   for the cats
3   at 2 a.m.
4   as I sit in here
5   with my
6   Beethoven.


7   "they're just prowling," I

10   majestically


11   and those damn cats
12   don't care
13   about
14   any of it


15   and
16   if they did
17   I wouldn't like them
18   as
19   well:

[Page 238 ]

28   for what he

37   licking

6   burning

5   pillows

7   I lost it
8   I lost it somewhere

11   or while watching a parade
12   I lost it
13   while watching a wrestling match


14   or while waiting at a red light
15   at noon on some smoggy day


16   I lost it while putting a coin

18   I lost it
19   as the wild dogs slept.

        Bukowski, Charles :  I meet the famous poet [from You Get So
        Alone At Times That It Just Makes Sense (1986) , Black Sparrow
        Press ]



1   this poet had long been famous
2   and after some decades of
3   obscurity I
4   got lucky
5   and this poet appeared
6   interested
7   and asked me to his
8   beach apartment.
9   he was homosexual and I was
10   straight, and worse, a
11   lush.


12   I came by, looked
13   about and
14   declaimed (as if I didn't
15   know), "hey, where the
16   fuck are the
17   babes?"


18   he just smiled and stroked
19   his mustache.


20   he had little lettuces and
21   delicate cheeses and
22   other dainties
23   in his refrigerator.
24   "where you keep your fucking
25   beer, man?" I
26   asked.


27   it didn't matter, I had
28   brought my own

[Page 242 ]


29   bottles and I began upon
30   them.


31   he began to look
32   alarmed: "I've heard about
33   your brutality, please
34   /desist/ from
35   that!"


36   I flopped down on his
37   couch, belched,
38   laughed: "ah, shit, baby, I'm
39   not gonna hurt ya! ha, ha,
40   ha!"


41   "you are a fine writer," he
42   said, "but as a person you are
43   /utterly/
44   despicable!"


45   "that's what I like about me
46   best, baby!" I
47   continued to pour them
48   down.


49   at once
50   he seemed to vanish behind
51   some sliding wooden
52   doors.


53   "hey, baby, come on
54   out! I ain't gonna do no
55   bad! we can sit around and
56   talk that dumb literary
57   bullshit all night
58   long! I won't

[Page 243 ]


59   brutalize you,
60   shit, I
61   promise!"


62   "I don't trust you,"
63   came the little
64   voice.


65   well, there was nothing to
66   do
67   but slug it down, I was
68   too drunk to drive
69   home.



70   when I awakened in the
71   morning he was standing over
72   me
73   smiling.


74   "uh," I said,
75   "hi ..."


76   "did you mean what you
77   said last night?" he
78   asked.


79   "uh, what wuz
80   ut?"


81   "I slid the doors back and
82   stood there and you saw
83   me and you said that
84   I looked like I was riding the
85   prow of some great sea

[Page 244 ]


86   ship ... you said that
87   I looked like a
88   /Norseman/ ! is
89   that true?"


90   "oh, yeah, yeah, you
91   did ..."


92   he fixed me some hot tea
93   with toast
94   and I got that
95   down.


96   "well," I said, "good to
97   have met
98   you ..."


99   "I'm sure," he
100   answered.


101   the door closed behind
102   me
103   and I found the elevator
104   down
105   and
106   after some wandering about the
107   beach front
108   I found my car, got
109   in, drove off
110   on what appeared to be
111   favorable terms
112   between the famous poet and
113   myself

[Page 245 ]


114   but
115   it wasn't
116   so:


117   he started writing un-
118   believably hateful stuff
119   about
120   me
121   and I
122   got my shots in at
123   him.


124   the whole matter
125   was just about
126   like
127   most other writers
128   meeting


129   and
130   anyhow
131   that part about
132   calling him a
133   /Norseman/
134   wasn't true at
135   all: I called him
136   a
137   /Viking/


138   and it also
139   isn't true
140   that without his
141   aid
142   I never would have
143   appeared in the
144   /Penguin Collection of/
145   /Modern Poets/

[Page 246 ]


146   along with him
147   and who
148   was it?


149   yeah:
150   Lamantia.


[Page 247 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  seize the day [from You Get So Alone At
        Times That It Just Makes Sense (1986) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   foul fellow he was always wiping his nose on his
2   sleeve and also farting at regular
3   intervals, he was
4   uncombed
5   uncouth
6   unwanted.
7   his every third word was a crass
8   entrail
9   and he grinned through broken yellow
10   teeth
11   his breath stinking above the
12   wind
13   he continually dug into his crotch
14   left-
15   handed
16   and he always had a
17   dirty joke
18   at the ready,
19   a dunce of the lowest
20   order
21   a most most
22   avoided
23   man


24   until


25   he won the state
26   lottery.


27   now
28   you should see
29   him: always a young laughing lady on
30   each arm

[Page 248 ]


31   he eats at the finest
32   places
33   the waiters fighting to get him
34   at their
35   table
36   he belches and farts away the
37   night
38   spilling his wineglass
39   picking up his steak with his
40   fingers
41   while
42   his ladies call him
43   "original" and "the funniest
44   man I ever met."
45   and what they do to him
46   in bed
47   is a damned
48   shame.


49   what we have to keep
50   remembering, though, is that
51   50% of the state lottery is given to the
52   Educational System and
53   that's important
54   when you realize that
55   only one person in
56   nine
57   can properly spell
58   "emulously."

1   I'm working on it as
2   the dawn bends toward me ...


3   I almost had it at 3:34 a.m. but it
4   slipped away from me
5   with the wizardry of a
6   silverfish ...


7   now
8   as the half-light moves toward me
9   like motherfucking death
10   I give up the battle
11   rise
12   move toward the bathroom
13   bang
14   into a wall
15   give a pitiful mewking
16   laugh ...
17   flick on the light and
18   begin to piss, yes, in
19   the proper place
20   and
21   after flushing
22   think: another night
23   gone.
24   well, we gave it a bit of
25   a roar
26   anyhow.


27   we wash our
28   claws ...
29   flick off the
30   light

[Page 250 ]


31   move toward the
32   bedroom where the
33   wife
34   awakens enough
35   to say: "don't step
36   on the cat!"


37   which brings us back
38   to
39   matters
40   real
41   as we find the bed
42   slip in
43   face to ceiling: a
44   grounded
45   drunken
46   fat
47   old
48   man.

        Bukowski, Charles :  magic machine [from You Get So Alone At
        Times That It Just Makes Sense (1986) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I liked the old records that
2   scratched
3   as the needle slid across
4   grooves well
5   worn
6   you heard the voice
7   coming through
8   the speaker
9   as if there were a person
10   inside that
11   mahogany
12   box


13   but you only listened while
14   your parents were
15   not there.
16   and if you didn't wind
17   the victrola
18   it gradually slowed and
19   stopped.


20   it was best in late
21   afternoons
22   and the records spoke
23   of
24   love.
25   love, love, love.
26   some of the records had
27   beautiful purple
28   labels,
29   others were orange, green,
30   yellow, red, blue.

[Page 252 ]




31   the victrola had belonged to
32   my grandfather
33   and he had listened to those
34   same
35   records.
36   and now I was a boy
37   and
38   I heard them.
39   and nothing I could think of
40   in my life then
41   seemed better than listening
42   to that
43   victrola
44   when my parents weren't
45   there.

        Bukowski, Charles :  those girls we followed home [from You Get
        So Alone At Times That It Just Makes Sense (1986) , Black
        Sparrow Press ]



1   in Jr. High the two prettiest girls were
2   Irene and Louise,
3   they were sisters;
4   Irene was a year older, a little taller
5   but it was difficult to choose between
6   them;
7   they were not only pretty but they were
8   astonishingly beautiful
9   so beautiful
10   that the boys stayed away from them;
11   they were terrified of Irene and
12   Louise
13   who weren't aloof at all,
14   even friendlier than most
15   but
16   who seemed to dress a bit
17   differently than the other
18   girls:
19   they always wore high heels,
20   silk stockings,
21   blouses,
22   skirts,
23   new outfits
24   each day;
25   and,
26   one afternoon
27   my buddy, Baldy, and I followed them
28   home from school;
29   you see, we were kind of
30   the bad guys on the grounds
31   so it was
32   more or less
33   expected,

[Page 254 ]


34   and
35   it was something:
36   walking along ten or twelve feet behind them;
37   we didn't say anything
38   we just followed
39   watching
40   their voluptuous swaying,
41   the balancing of the
42   haunches.


43   we liked it so much that we
44   followed them home from school
45   every
46   day.


47   when they'd go into their house
48   we'd stand outside on the sidewalk
49   smoking cigarettes and talking.


50   "someday," I told Baldy,
51   "they are going to invite us inside their
52   house and they are going to
53   fuck us."


54   "you really think so?"


55   "sure."


56   now
57   50 years later
58   I can tell you
59   they never did
60   ---never mind all the stories we
61   told the guys;
62   yes, it's the dream that

[Page 255 ]


63   keeps you going
64   then and
65   now.

        Bukowski, Charles :  a following [from You Get So Alone At Times
        That It Just Makes Sense (1986) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the phone rang at 1:30 a.m.
2   and it was a man from Denver:


3   "Chinaski, you got a following in
4   Denver ..."


5   "yeah?"


6   "yeah, I got a magazine and I want some
7   poems from you ..."


8   "FUCK YOU, CHINASKI!" I heard a voice
9   in the background ...


10   "I see you have a friend,"
11   I said.


12   "yeah," he answered, "now, I want
13   six poems ..."


14   "CHINASKI SUCKS! CHINASKI'S A PRICK!"
15   I heard the other
16   voice.


17   "you fellows been drinking?"
18   I asked.


19   "so what?" he answered. "you drink."


20   "that's true ..."


21   "CHINASKI'S AN ASSHOLE!"

[Page 259 ]




22   then
23   the editor of the magazine gave me the
24   address and I copied it down on the back
25   of an envelope.


26   "send us some poems now ..."


27   "I'll see what I can do ..."


28   "CHINASKI WRITES SHIT!"


29   "goodbye," I said.


30   "goodbye," said the
31   editor.


32   I hung up.


33   there are certainly any number of lonely
34   people without much to do with
35   their nights.

        Bukowski, Charles :  a tragic meeting [from You Get So Alone At
        Times That It Just Makes Sense (1986) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I was more visible and available then
2   and I had this great weakness:
3   I thought that going to bed with many women
4   meant that a man was clever and good and
5   superior
6   especially if he did it at the age of
7   55
8   to any number of bunnies
9   and I lifted weights
10   drank like mad
11   and did
12   that.


13   most of the women were nice
14   and most of them looked good
15   and only one or two were really dumb and
16   dull
17   but JoJo
18   I can't even categorize.
19   her letters were slight, repeated
20   the same things:
21   "I like your books, would like to meet
22   you ..."
23   I wrote back and told her
24   it would be
25   all right.


26   then along came the instructions
27   where I was to meet
28   her: at this college
29   on this date
30   at this time

[Page 261 ]


31   just after her
32   classes.


33   the college was up in the
34   hills and
35   the day and time
36   arrived
37   and with her drawings
38   of twisting streets
39   plus a road map
40   I set out.


41   it was somewhere between the Rose Bowl
42   and one of the largest graveyards in
43   Southern California
44   and I got there early and sat in my
45   car
46   nipping at the Cutty Sark
47   and looking at the
48   co-eds---there were so many of
49   them, one simply couldn't have
50   them /all/ .


51   then the bell rang and I got out of my
52   car and walked to the front of the
53   building, there was a long row of
54   steps and the students walked out of the
55   building and down the steps
56   and I stood and
57   waited, and like with airport
58   arrivals
59   I had no idea
60   which one
61   it would be.

[Page 262 ]




62   "Chinaski," somebody said
63   and there she was: 18, 19,
64   neither ugly nor beautiful, of
65   average body and features,
66   seeming to be neither vicious,
67   intelligent, dumb or
68   insane.


69   we kissed lightly and then
70   I asked her if she
71   had a car
72   and she said
73   she had a car
74   and I said, "fine, I'll drive you
75   to it, then you follow
76   me ..."


77   JoJo was a good follower, she followed me all
78   the way to my beat-up court in east
79   Hollywood.


80   I poured her a drink and we talked very
81   drab talk and kissed a
82   bit.
83   the kisses were neither good nor bad
84   nor interesting or un-
85   interesting.


86   much time went by and she drank very
87   little
88   and we kissed some more and she said,
89   "I like your books, they really do things
90   to me."
91   "Fuck my books!" I told her.
92   I was down to my shorts and I had her
93   skirt up to her ass

[Page 263 ]


94   and I was working hard
95   but she just kissed and
96   talked.
97   she responded and she didn't
98   respond.


99   then
100   I gave up and started drinking
101   heavily.
102   she mentioned a few of the other
103   writers
104   she liked
105   but she didn't like any of them
106   the way she liked
107   me.


108   "yeah," I poured a new one, "is that
109   so?"


110   "I've got to get going," JoJo said,
111   "I've got a class in the
112   morning."


113   "you can sleep here," I suggested, "and
114   get an early start, I scramble great
115   eggs."


116   "no, thank you, I've got to
117   go ..."


118   and she left with
119   several copies of my books
120   she had never seen
121   before,
122   copies I had given her

[Page 264 ]


123   much /earlier/ in the
124   evening.


125   I had another drink and decided to
126   sleep it off
127   as an unexplainable
128   loss.


129   I switched off the lights
130   and threw myself upon the
131   bed without
132   washing-up or
133   brushing my
134   teeth.


135   I looked up into the dark
136   and thought, now, here is one
137   I will never be able to
138   write about:
139   she was neither good nor bad,
140   real or unreal, kind or
141   unkind, she was just a girl
142   from a college
143   somewhere between the Rose Bowl and
144   the dumping grounds.


145   then I began to itch, I scratched
146   myself, I seemed to feel things
147   on my face, on my belly, I inhaled,
148   exhaled, tried to sleep but
149   the itching got worse, then
150   I felt a bite, then several bites,
151   things appeared to be
152   crawling on me ...

[Page 265 ]




153   I rushed to the bathroom
154   and switched on the light


155   my god, JoJo had /fleas/ .


156   I stepped into the shower
157   stood there
158   adjusting the water,
159   thinking,
160   that poor
161   dear
162   girl.

1   ah, my friend, it's awful, worse
2   than that---you just get
3   going good---
4   one bottle down and
5   gone---
6   the poems simmering in your
7   head
8   but
9   halfway between 60 and
10   70
11   you pause
12   before opening the
13   second bottle---
14   sometimes
15   don't
16   for after 50 years of
17   heavy drinking
18   you might assume
19   that extra bottle
20   will set you
21   babbling in some
22   rest home
23   or tender you
24   a stroke
25   alone in your
26   place
27   the cats chewing at
28   your flesh
29   as the morning fog
30   enters the broken
31   screen.

[Page 269 ]




32   one doesn't even /think/ of
33   the liver
34   and if the liver
35   doesn't think of
36   us, that's
37   fine.


38   but it does seem
39   the more we drink
40   the better the words
41   go.


42   death doesn't matter
43   but the ultimate inconvenience
44   of near-death is worse than
45   galling.


46   I'll finish the night off
47   with
48   beer.

4   folded the road maps
5   canceled my subscription to /Time/

7   I've taken the flea collars off my cats

1   new jock in from Arizona
2   doesn't know this town
3   but his agent did get him a mount
4   in the first race
5   last Saturday
6   and the jock took the freeway
7   in
8   on the same day as
9   the U.S.C. vs. U.C.L.A. football
10   game
11   and got caught
12   in one of the two special lanes
13   which took him to the Rose Bowl
14   instead of the race
15   track.
16   he was forced to drive all the way
17   to the football game
18   parking lot
19   before he could turn
20   around.
21   by the time he got to the track
22   the first race
23   was over.
24   another jock had won with his
25   mount.


26   today out there
27   I noticed on the program that the
28   new jock from Arizona
29   had a good mount in the
30   6th.
31   then the horse became a late
32   scratch.

33   sometimes getting started

39   nobody has the time
40   to notice.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the death of a splendid neighborhood [from
        You Get So Alone At Times That It Just Makes Sense (1986) ,
        Black Sparrow Press ]



1   there was a place off Western Ave.
2   where you went up a stairway
3   to get head
4   and there was a big biker
5   sitting there
6   wearing his swastika jacket.
7   he was there to smell you out
8   if you were the
9   heat
10   and to protect the girls
11   if you weren't.
12   it was just above the
13   Philadelphia Hoagie Shop
14   there in L.A.
15   where the girls came down
16   when things got
17   slow
18   and ate something
19   else.
20   the man who ran the
21   sandwich shop
22   hated the girls
23   he didn't like to
24   serve them
25   but he was
26   afraid not
27   to.


28   then one day
29   I came by
30   and the biker wasn't there
31   or the girls
32   either,

[Page 275 ]


33   and it hadn't been a simple
34   bust
35   it had been a
36   shoot-out:
37   there were bullet holes
38   in the door
39   above the
40   stairway.


41   I went into the Hoagie shop
42   for a sandwich and a
43   beer
44   and the proprietor told
45   me,
46   "things are better
47   now."


48   after that
49   I had to leave town
50   for a couple of
51   days
52   and when I got back
53   and walked down
54   to the Hoagie shop
55   I saw that the plate glass
56   window
57   had been busted
58   out
59   and was covered with
60   boards.
61   inside the walls
62   and the counter had been
63   blackened by
64   fire.

[Page 276 ]




65   about that same
66   time
67   my girlfriend went crazy
68   and started screwing one man
69   after
70   another.


71   almost everything good was
72   gone.
73   I gave my landlord a month's
74   notice and moved in
75   3 weeks.

        makes sense [from You Get So Alone At Times That It Just Makes
        Sense (1986) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   when I was a starving writer I used to read the major writers
2   in the
3   major magazines (in the library, of course) and it made me feel
4   very bad because---being a student of the word and the way, I
5   realized
6   that they were faking it: I could sense each false emotion, each
7   utter pretense, it made me feel that the editors had their
8   heads up their asses---or were being politicized into publishing
9   in-groups of power
10   but
11   I just kept writing and not eating very much---went down
12   from 197 pounds
13   to 137---but---got very much practice typing and reading
14   printed rejection
15   slips.


16   it was when I reached 137 pounds that I said, to hell with it,
17   quit
18   typing and concentrated on drinking and the streets and the
19   ladies of
20   the streets---at least those people didn't read /Harper's, The/
21   /Atlantic/ or
22   /Poetry, a magazine of verse/ .


23   and frankly, it was a fair and refreshing ten year lay-off


24   then I came back and tried it again to find that the editors still
25   had
26   their heads up their asses and/or etc.
27   but I was up to 225 pounds

[Page 278 ]


28   rested
29   and full of background music---


30   ready to give it another shot in the
31   dark.

1   I keep hearing from the old dogs,
2   men who have been writing for
3   decades,
4   poets all,
5   they're still at their
6   typers
7   writing better than
8   ever
9   past wives and wars and

11   and all the things that
12   happen.
13   many I disliked for personal
14   and artistic
15   reasons ...
16   but what I overlooked was
17   their endurance and
18   their ability to
19   improve.


20   these old dogs
21   living in smoky rooms
22   pouring the
23   bottle ...


24   they lash against the

27   fight.

8   on park benches, on buses, at dances and parties, at
9   beauty contests, cafes, circuses, parades, department
10   stores, skeet shoots, balloon flys, auto races, rodeos,
11   bull fights, mud wrestling, roller derbies, pie bakes,
12   churches, volleyball games, boat races, county fairs,

5   and the wrist watch crawls like a snake across the back of the
6   dresser
7   and the refrigerator contains 9,000 frozen red hot dreams
8   and as I listen to the symphonies of dead composers
9   I am consumed with a glad sadness
10   there's fire in the walls
11   and the snails in the garden only want love
12   and there's fire in the crabgrass
13   we are burning burning burning
14   there's fire in a glass of water
15   the tombs of India smile like smitten motherfuckers
16   the meter maids cry alone at one a.m. on rainy nights
17   there's fire in the cracks of the sidewalks
18   and
19   all during the night as I have been drinking and typing these
20   eleven or twelve poems
21   the lights have gone off and on
22   there is a wild wind outside
23   and in between times
24   I have sat in the dark here
25   electric (haha) typer off lights out radio off
26   drinking in the dark
27   lighting cigarettes in the dark
28   there was fire off the match
29   we are all burning together

1   you think about the time in
2   Malibu
3   after taking the tall girl
4   to dinner and drinks
5   you came out to the Volks
6   and the clutch was
7   gone
8   (no Auto Club card)
9   nothing out there but the
10   ocean and
11   25 miles to your
12   room
13   (her suitcase there
14   after an air trip from somewhere

16   and you say to her, "well,
17   maybe we'll swim back in," and
18   she forgets to
19   smile.


20   and the problem with
21   writing these poems
22   as you get into number 7 or

25   3 a.m.

9   you find a small pack of

13   but the matches go
14   limp against the worn match
15   cover


16   shit:
17   drink without smoke is like
18   cock without
19   pussy


20   you drink some
21   more
22   search about


23   find one paper match of

44   receipt


45   : some of the empty match
46   books


47   : even one of the dead
48   lighters


49   the flame whirls and
50   leaps

[Page 286 ]




51   then the whole ashtray of
52   cigarette and cigar stubs
53   begins to smoke
54   as if mouths were inhaling
55   them


56   you battle the flames with
57   various and sundry objects
58   including your
59   hands


60   until finally the flame is
61   gone and there is nothing but
62   smoke


63   as again you get that
64   re-occurring thought: /I must be/
65   /crazy/ .


66   you hear your wife's
67   voice:


68   "Hank, are you all
69   right?"


70   she's on the other side of
71   the wall in the
72   bedroom


73   "oh, I'm fine ..."


74   "I smell smoke ... is the house burning
75   down?"


76   "just a small fire, Linda ... I got
77   it ... go to sleep ..."

[Page 287 ]




78   she is the one who got you
79   the steel wastebasket
80   after a similar
81   occurrence


82   soon she is asleep
83   again


84   and you're searching


85   for more
86   matches.

1   I was a crazed young man and then found this book written
2   by a
3   crazed older man and I felt better because he was
4   able to write it down
5   and then I found a later book by this same crazed older
6   man
7   only to me
8   he seemed no longer crazed he just appeared to be
9   dull---
10   we all hold up well for a while, then inherent with flaws and
11   skips and misses
12   most of us
13   so often deteriorate overnight
14   into a state so near defecation
15   that the end result is almost unbearable to the
16   senses.


17   luckily, I found a few other crazed men who almost remained
18   that
19   way until they
20   died.


21   that's more sporting, you know, and lends a bit more to our
22   lives
23   as we attend to our---
24   inumbrate---
25   tasks.

1   complaint is often the result of an insufficient
2   ability
3   to live within
4   the obvious restrictions of this
5   god damned cage.
6   complaint is a common deficiency
7   more prevalent than
8   hemorrhoids
9   and as these lady writers hurl their spiked shoes
10   at me
11   wailing that
12   their poems will never be
13   promulgated
14   all that I can say to them
15   is
16   show me more leg
17   show me more ass---
18   that's all you (or I) have
19   while
20   it lasts


21   and for this common and obvious truth
22   they screech at me:
23   MOTHERFUCKER SEXIST PIG!


24   as if that would stop the way fruit trees
25   drop their fruit
26   or the ocean brings in the coni and
27   the dead spores of the Grecian
28   Empire


29   but I feel no grief for being called something
30   which

[Page 292 ]


31   I am not;
32   in fact, it's enthralling, somehow, like a good
33   back rub
34   on a frozen night
35   behind the ski lift at
36   Aspen.

1   ah, those days when I
2   ran them
3   in and out of my
4   shabby apartment.


5   god, I was a hairy
6   ugly
7   thing


8   and I backed them
9   all onto the
10   springs


11   flailing
12   away


13   I was the mindless
14   drunken ape
15   in a sad and
16   dying
17   neighborhood.


18   but strangest
19   of all
20   were the
21   new and continuous
22   arrivals:


23   it was a
24   female
25   parade

[Page 294 ]




26   and
27   I exulted
28   pranced and
29   pounced


30   with hardly
31   an idea
32   of what
33   it
34   meant.


35   it was a well-
36   remembered bed-
37   room
38   painted a strange
39   blue.


40   and
41   most of the
42   ladies
43   left just before
44   noon


45   about the time
46   the mailman
47   arrived.


48   he spoke to me
49   one day, "my god,
50   man, where do you
51   get them all?"


52   "I don't know," I
53   told him.

[Page 295 ]




54   "pardon me," he went
55   on, "but you don't
56   exactly look like
57   God's gift to
58   women, how do you
59   do it?"


60   "I don't know,"
61   I said.


62   and it was
63   true: it just
64   happened and I
65   did it


66   in my blue
67   bedroom
68   with my
69   dead mother's
70   best lace table
71   linen
72   tacked up
73   over the
74   window.


75   I was a
76   fucking
77   fool.

        Bukowski, Charles :  over done [from You Get So Alone At Times

1   he had somehow located me again---he was on the
2   telephone---talking
3   about the old days---
4   wonder whatever happened to Michael or Ken or
5   Julie Anne?---
6   and remember...?


7   ---then
8   there were his present problems---


9   ---he was a talker---he had always been a
10   talker---


11   and I had been a
12   listener


13   I had listened because I hadn't wanted to
14   hurt him
15   by telling him to shut up
16   like the others
17   did
18   in the old
19   days


20   now
21   he was back


22   and
23   I held the phone out
24   at arm's length
25   and could still hear the
26   sound---

[Page 297 ]




27   I handed the phone to my girlfriend and
28   she listened for a
29   while---


30   finally
31   I took the phone and told him---


32   hey, man, we've got to stop, the meat's burning
33   in the oven!


34   he said, o.k., man, I'll call you
35   back---


36   (one thing I remembered about my
37   old buddy: he was good for his
38   word)


39   I put the phone back on the
40   receiver---


41   ---we don't have any meat in the
42   oven, said my
43   girlfriend---


44   ---yes, we do, I told her,
45   it's
46   me.

1   as the child crosses the street as deep sea divers
2   dive as the painters paint---
3   the good fight against terrible odds is the vin-
4   dication and the glory as the swallow rises toward
5   the moon---
6   it is so dark now with the sadness of
7   people
8   they were tricked, they were taught to expect the
9   ultimate when nothing is
10   promised
11   now young girls weep alone in small rooms
12   old men angrily swing their canes at
13   visions as
14   ladies comb their hair as
15   ants search for survival
16   history surrounds us
17   and our lives
18   slink away
19   in
20   shame.

1   competition, greed, desire for fame---
2   after great beginnings they mostly
3   write when they don't want to write, they write to
4   order, they write for Cadillacs and younger
5   girls---and to pay off
6   old wives.


7   they appear on talk shows, attend parties
8   with their peers.
9   most go to Hollywood, they become snipers and
10   gossips
11   and have more and more affairs with younger
12   and younger girls and/or
13   men.
14   they write between Hollywood and the parties,
15   it's timeclock writing
16   and in between the panties and/or the
17   jockstraps
18   and the cocaine
19   many of them manage to screw up with the
20   IRS.


21   between old wives, new wives, newer and
22   newer girls (and/or)
23   all their royalties and residuals---
24   the hundreds of thousands of
25   dollars---
26   are now suddenly
27   debts.


28   the writing becomes a useless
29   spasm
30   a jerk-off of a once

[Page 300 ]


31   mighty
32   gift.


33   it happens and happens and
34   continues to:
35   the mutilation of talent
36   the gods seldom
37   give
38   but so quickly
39   take.


[Page 301 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  what am I doing? [from You Get So Alone At

1   got to stop battling these wild speed jocks on the freeway as
2   we
3   roar through hairline openings with stereo blasting through
4   noon and evening and darkness
5   when actually all we want is to sit in cool green gardens
6   talking quietly over drinks.
7   what makes us this way?---ingrown toenails?---or that the ladies
8   are not enough?---what foolishness makes us tweak the nose of
9   Death
10   continually?
11   are we afraid of the slow bedpan?---or slobbering over half-
12   cooked peas brought to us by a bored nurse with thick
13   dumb legs?
14   what wanton hare-brained impulse makes us floor it with
15   only one hand on the wheel?
16   don't we realize the peace of aging
17   gently?
18   what hell-call is this to war?


19   we are the sickest of the breed---as fine museums---great art---
20   generations of knowledge---are all forgotten
21   as we find profundity in being an
22   asshole---
23   we are going to end up as a
24   photograph---almost life-sized---hanging
25   as a warning on the
26   Traffic Court wall


27   and people will shudder just a bit and
28   look the other way


29   knowing that
30   too much ego is not
31   enough.

        Bukowski, Charles :  nervous people [from You Get So Alone At

1   you go in for an item---take it to the clerk at the register---he
2   doesn't know the price---begs leave---returns after a long
3   time---stares at the electronic cash register---rings up the
4   sale with some difficulty: $47,583.64---you don't have it
5   with you---he laughs---calls for help---another clerk
6   arrives---after another long time he finds a new total:
7   $1.27. I pay---then must ask for a bag---I thank the
8   clerk---walk to parking with the lady I am with---"you
9   make people nervous," she tells me---


10   we drive home with the item---we put the item to its task---it
11   doesn't work---the item has a factory
12   defect---
13   "I'll take it back," she says---


14   I go to the bathroom and piss squarely in the center of the
15   pot---warfare is just one of the problems which besets everyone
16   during the life of a decent day.

1   Van Gogh cut off his ear
2   gave it to a

4   who flung it away in
5   extreme
6   disgust.


7   Van, whores don't want
8   ears
9   they want
10   money.


11   I guess that's why you were
12   such a great

[Page 304 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  how is your heart? [from You Get So Alone
        At Times That It Just Makes Sense (1986) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   during my worst times
2   on the park benches
3   in the jails
4   or living with
5   whores
6   I always had this certain
7   contentment---
8   I wouldn't call it
9   happiness---
10   it was more of an inner
11   balance
12   that settled for
13   whatever was occurring
14   and it helped in the
15   factories
16   and when relationships
17   went wrong
18   with the
19   girls.


20   it helped
21   through the
22   wars and the
23   hangovers
24   the backalley fights
25   the
26   hospitals.


27   to awaken in a cheap room
28   in a strange city and
29   pull up the shade---
30   this was the craziest kind of
31   contentment

[Page 305 ]




32   and to walk across the floor
33   to an old dresser with a
34   cracked mirror---
35   see myself, ugly,
36   grinning at it all.


37   what matters most is
38   how well you
39   walk through the
40   fire.


[Page 306 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  forget it [from You Get So Alone At Times

1   now, listen, when I die I don't want any crying, just get the
2   disposal under way, I've had a full some life, and
3   if anybody has had an edge, I've
4   had it, I've lived 7 or 8 lives in one, enough for
5   anybody.
6   we are all, finally, the same, so no speeches, please,
7   unless you want to say he played the horses and was very
8   good at that.


9   you're next and I already know something you don't,
10   maybe.


[Page 307 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  quiet [from You Get So Alone At Times That
        It Just Makes Sense (1986) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   sitting tonight
2   at this
3   table
4   by the
5   window


6   the woman is
7   glooming
8   in the
9   bedroom


10   these are her
11   especially bad
12   days.


13   well, I have
14   mine


15   so
16   in deference
17   to her


18   the typewriter
19   is
20   still.


21   it's odd,
22   printing this stuff
23   by
24   hand


25   reminds me of
26   days

[Page 308 ]


27   past
28   when things were
29   not
30   going well
31   in another
32   fashion.


33   now
34   the cat comes to
35   see
36   me


37   he flops
38   under the table
39   between my
40   feet


41   we are both
42   melting
43   in the same
44   fire.


45   and, dear
46   cat, we're still
47   working with the
48   poem


49   and some have
50   noted
51   that there's some
52   "slippage"
53   here.


54   well, at age
55   65, I can
56   "slip"

[Page 309 ]




57   plenty, yet still
58   run rings
59   around
60   those pamby
61   critics.


62   Li Po knew
63   what to do:
64   drink another
65   bottle and
66   face
67   the consequences.


68   I turn to my
69   right, see this huge
70   head (reflected in the
71   window) sucking at
72   a cigarette
73   and


74   we grin at
75   each
76   other.


77   then
78   I turn
79   back


80   sit here
81   and
82   print more words upon this
83   paper


84   there is never
85   a final

[Page 310 ]


86   grand
87   statement


88   and that's the
89   fix
90   and the trick
91   that works
92   against
93   us


94   but
95   I wish you could see
96   my
97   cat


98   he has a
99   splash
100   of white on his
101   face
102   against an
103   orange-yellow
104   background


105   and then
106   as I look up
107   and into the
108   kitchen


109   I see a bright
110   portion
111   under the overhead
112   light


113   that shades into
114   darkness

[Page 311 ]


115   and then into darker
116   darkness and
117   I can't see
118   beyond
119   that.

        Bukowski, Charles :  it's ours [from You Get So Alone At Times

1   there is always that space there
2   just before they get to us
3   that space
4   that fine relaxer
5   the breather
6   while say
7   flopping on a bed
8   thinking of nothing
9   or say
10   pouring a glass of water from the
11   spigot
12   while entranced by
13   nothing


14   that
15   gentle pure
16   space


17   it's worth


18   centuries of
19   existence


20   say


21   just to scratch your neck
22   while looking out the window at
23   a bare branch


24   that space
25   there
26   before they get to us

[Page 313 ]


27   ensures
28   that
29   when they do
30   they won't
31   get it all


32   ever.

[Page 17 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  God's man [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   we were 10 or 11 years old
2   when we went to see the
3   priest.


4   we knocked.
5   a fat, frumpy woman
6   answered the door.
7   "yes?" she asked.


8   "we want to see the
9   priest," one of us
10   said.
11   I think it was Frank
12   who said
13   it.


14   "Father," the woman
15   turned her head,
16   "some boys want to
17   see you."


18   "tell them to come
19   in," said the
20   priest.


21   "follow me," said the
22   fat, frumpy lady.


23   we followed her.
24   the priest was in his
25   study.
26   he was behind his
27   desk.
28   he pushed some papers
29   aside.


30   "yes, boys?"

[Page 18 ]




31   the lady left the
32   room.


33   "well," I said.


34   "well," said Frank.


35   "yes, boys, go ahead ..."


36   "well," said Frank, "we
37   wondered if God was
38   really there."


39   the Father smiled.


40   "but, of course, He
41   is."


42   "but where is He?"
43   I asked.


44   "haven't you boys
45   studied your catechism?
46   God is Everywhere."


47   "oh," said Frank.


48   "thank you, Father,
49   we just wanted to
50   know," I said.


51   "it's quite all right,
52   boys, I'm glad you
53   asked."


54   "thank you, Father,"
55   said Frank.


56   we both did little
57   bows, then

[Page 19 ]


58   turned
59   and walked out of
60   the room.


61   the fat, frumpy lady
62   was waiting.
63   she led us down the
64   hall and to the
65   door.


66   we walked along the
67   street.


68   "I wonder if he's
69   fucking her?" Frank
70   asked.


71   I looked around for God,
72   then answered,
73   "of course, he isn't."


74   "but what does he do
75   when he gets
76   excited?"
77   asked Frank.


78   "he probably prays,"
79   I said.


80   "it's not the same
81   thing," said Frank.


82   "he has God," I said,
83   "he doesn't need
84   that."


85   "I think he's fucking
86   her," said Frank.


87   "oh yeah?"

[Page 20 ]




88   "yeah.
89   why don't we go back
90   and ask him?"


91   "you go back and ask
92   him," I said. "you're
93   the one who's
94   curious.


95   "I'm afraid to,"
96   said Frank.


97   "you're afraid of God,"
98   I said.


99   "well, aren't you?"
100   he asked.


101   "sure."


102   we stopped then at a
103   red light, waiting for
104   traffic.
105   neither of us had been
106   to Mass for
107   months.
108   it was boring.
109   it was more fun
110   talking to the
111   priest.


112   the light changed and
113   we crossed
114   over.

        Bukowski, Charles :  not normal [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   when I was in grammar school
2   our teacher told us a story
3   about a sailor
4   who told the captain,
5   "the flag? I hope that I /never/
6   see the flag again!"
7   "very well," he was told,
8   "you will get your
9   wish!"
10   and they put him in the
11   hold of the sailing ship
12   and kept him there,
13   sending down his
14   food
15   and he died down there
16   without ever seeing the
17   flag again.


18   it was a real horror
19   story for the other children,
20   very
21   effective.
22   but it wasn't quite
23   as effective with
24   me.
25   I sat there thinking,
26   well, it's too bad
27   about not seeing the
28   flag
29   but the best part was
30   not having to see the
31   other people.


32   I didn't raise my hand to
33   say anything about that,
34   though.
35   that would mean that
36   I didn't want to see them

[Page 22 ]


37   either.
38   which was true.


39   I looked straight forward
40   at the blackboard
41   which looked far better
42   than
43   any of
44   them.

        Bukowski, Charles :  classical [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   our English teacher in Jr. High,
2   Mrs. Gredis, didn't sit behind
3   her desk, she kept the front
4   desk empty and she sat on
5   the top of the front desk
6   and crossed her legs high and
7   we saw those long silken
8   legs, those magical flanks,
9   that shining warm flesh as she
10   twisted her ankles and re-
11   crossed her legs with those
12   black high-heeled shoes and
13   spoke of Hawthorne and
14   Melville and Poe and others.
15   we boys didn't hear a word
16   but English was our favorite
17   subject and we never spoke
18   badly of Mrs. Gredis, we didn't
19   even discuss her among our-
20   selves, we just sat in that
21   class and looked at Mrs. Gredis
22   and we knew that our mothers
23   were not like that or the girls
24   in the class were not like that
25   or even the women we saw
26   on the street were not like that.
27   nobody was like Mrs. Gredis
28   and Mrs. Gredis knew that too,
29   sitting there on that front desk,
30   perched in front of 20 fourteen-
31   year-old boys who would never
32   forget her
33   through the wars and the years,
34   never a lady like that
35   watching us as she talked,
36   watching us looking at her,
37   there was laughter in her eyes,
38   she smiled at us,

[Page 24 ]


39   crossed and recrossed her legs
40   again and again,
41   the skirt slipping, inching
42   delicately higher and higher
43   as she spoke of Hawthorne and
44   Poe and Melville and more
45   until the bell rang
46   ending the class,
47   the fastest hour of our day.
48   thank you, Mrs. Gredis, for that
49   most marvelous
50   education, you made learning
51   more than
52   easy, thank you, Mrs.
53   Gredis, thank
54   you.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the puking lady [from Bone Palace Ballet:
        New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   we were around 14, Baldy
2   Norman and myself.
3   we were sitting in the neighborhood
4   park around ten p.m.
5   drinking stolen beer.


6   then we saw a car drive up to the
7   curb.
8   the door opened and a lady
9   leaned out and vomited into
10   the street.
11   she cut loose a good
12   load.
13   she sat awhile.
14   then she got out of her
15   car
16   and walked into the
17   park.
18   she weaved a
19   bit.


20   "she's drunk," said
21   Norman, "let's fuck
22   her!"


23   "o.k.," I said.


24   "o.k.," said Baldy.


25   she was moving
26   through the park
27   walking along
28   unsteadily.
29   she was
30   heavy but
31   young,
32   good breasts,
33   nice legs,

[Page 26 ]


34   she wobbled on
35   her high heels.


36   "I'll get her
37   good," said Baldy.


38   "I'll get her good!"
39   said Norman.


40   then she saw us
41   sitting on the
42   bench.


43   "oh," she said.


44   she moved closer,
45   staring.


46   "oh, you're just nice
47   young boys ..."


48   we didn't like that.


49   "how about a drink,
50   baby?" Norman
51   asked.


52   "oh no, I've had
53   too much to drink,
54   I feel awful, I've
55   had a fight with my
56   boyfriend ..."


57   she stood weaving
58   in the moonlight.


59   "what's he got I don't
60   have?" asked
61   Norman.

[Page 27 ]




62   "don't get fresh!"


63   "come here, baby,
64   I got something I want
65   to show you,"
66   said Baldy.


67   "I'm leaving," she
68   said and began
69   walking off.


70   Baldy jumped up
71   (he was half drunk)
72   and followed
73   her.


74   "I got something
75   for you, baby!"


76   the lady began
77   running.
78   Baldy ran after
79   her.


80   when he attempted
81   to tackle her,
82   he missed, bounced
83   off her large
84   buttocks and fell
85   to the
86   grass.


87   the lady ran to
88   her car,
89   started it and
90   gunned off down
91   the street.


92   Baldy came walking
93   back toward

[Page 28 ]


94   us.


95   "shit, that whore!"


96   he sat down with us
97   on the bench,
98   picked up his beer
99   can and had a
100   mighty slug.


101   "she wanted it,
102   she wanted it
103   bad," he said.


104   "you've got guts,
105   Baldy," I said.


106   "think she'll come
107   back?" Norman
108   asked.


109   "sure," said Baldy,
110   "she wants this
111   turkey neck I
112   got."


113   I don't think any of
114   us thought she would
115   be back
116   but we sat there
117   drinking the beer
118   and
119   waiting.


120   we were all
121   virgins.
122   but we felt very
123   powerful then,
124   sitting there smoking
125   cigarettes,

[Page 29 ]


126   emptying cans of
127   beer.


128   later we would all
129   go home and
130   masturbate,
131   thinking about that
132   woman in the
133   park,
134   kissing that whiskey mouth,
135   her legs high in the
136   moonlight,
137   the park fountain
138   spewing its
139   water
140   as our parents
141   slept in the other
142   bedroom,
143   tired of it
144   all.

        Bukowski, Charles :  depression kid [from Bone Palace Ballet:
        New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I never had money but I did have a
2   bike
3   and there was little to do in the
4   summer but ride my bike to the
5   beach and back.
6   it was a bloody-ass haul from L.A. to
7   Venice
8   but there was nothing else.
9   one thing, it really built up my
10   legs.
11   I was 14 years old and I had the
12   most powerful legs in the
13   Southland, maybe.


14   the thing that made the
15   ride more exciting was to
16   attempt to shorten the time
17   it took to make the
18   trip.
19   each time I broke my own
20   record I'd go for a new
21   one.


22   I pedaled faster and
23   faster.
24   and that was all right
25   except one sunny day while
26   I was really pumping
27   along
28   this guy in a
29   red sports car
30   screamed at me,
31   "Hey, kid, watch where
32   the fuck you're going!"
33   I looked over and there
34   was this old guy in a late
35   model car,
36   smoking a cigar

[Page 31 ]


37   and he had a young
38   blonde with him.
39   her long hair was blowing
40   in the wind.


41   "Up your ass!" I yelled
42   back.


43   he slowed his car down
44   as I pumped alongside.
45   he looked over at me
46   and said, "Would you
47   mind repeating
48   that?"


49   I repeated that.
50   the girl with her hair
51   blowing in the wind
52   looked at him and
53   laughed.


54   "I've got a good mind to
55   park
56   and beat the crap
57   out of you!"


58   "Park it!
59   Park it!"
60   I yelled.


61   he roared ahead
62   and parked at the
63   curb.
64   I parked my bike
65   and walked toward
66   him.
67   I had no fear.
68   I felt great.

[Page 32 ]




69   I walked up to the car.
70   he looked at me
71   from the car.
72   he didn't get
73   out.
74   the young girl was
75   saying something
76   to him.
77   suddenly he
78   started the car
79   and pulled
80   away.


81   he took a right at
82   the corner.
83   I walked back to my
84   bike.
85   I got on and started
86   pedaling.


87   then he was back.
88   he'd circled the block.
89   I saw his face as he looked
90   at me.
91   I'd seldom seen such
92   hatred.


93   then he was gone
94   down the boulevard
95   out of sight with his young
96   girl.


97   I pedaled along.
98   I was no longer in a hurry.


99   to hell with the record.
100   I had called the guy's
101   card and
102   the girl with the long
103   hair was thinking of

[Page 33 ]


104   me.


105   I had become a
106   man.


[Page 34 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  burlesque [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   Jimmy, Bill and I went every
2   Sunday.
3   the place was on Main Street
4   with photos of the girls posted
5   outside.
6   the girls weren't always the
7   same.
8   sometimes one of them
9   would leave.
10   then you'd see a girl who
11   had been in the chorus
12   line,
13   she'd be up there
14   stripping.
15   or you'd see a girl who
16   had been stripping
17   and she'd be back in the
18   chorus line,
19   a younger stripper having
20   replaced her.
21   there was something sad
22   about it all.
23   and it got worse
24   during the show,
25   some of
26   the old guys jerking
27   off.
28   the young guys never
29   jerked off,
30   it was always the old
31   guys,
32   most of them sat in
33   the first row
34   which was called
35   "Bald-headed
36   Row."


37   I liked the comedian

[Page 35 ]


38   best, he was dressed in
39   floppy clothes, suspenders,
40   big shoes,
41   felt hat turned up in front
42   and back.
43   he was really good,
44   we laughed at his jokes
45   and antics.


46   the most beautiful stripper always
47   came on last.
48   and once in a while
49   she would show
50   /everything/ .
51   sometimes the show was
52   raided.
53   (we were never there
54   when it was raided)
55   but when the theatre was raided
56   it always opened up again a
57   week later with the same
58   strippers.


59   we were there one time when
60   the most beautiful stripper showed
61   /everything/ .
62   we couldn't believe
63   it.


64   "did you see it?"


65   "I saw it!"


66   "I saw it too!"


67   we walked out into the
68   street in
69   disbelief.


70   "I'll bet they close the

[Page 36 ]


71   place down!"


72   "maybe there wasn't a
73   vice cop in the
74   audience.
75   sometimes
76   the manager
77   knows this and
78   he tells the stripper
79   it's safe
80   and then
81   she shows her
82   pussy."


83   "then how come they
84   sometimes
85   get caught?"


86   "that's because sometimes
87   there's a new vice squad guy there
88   they don't know."


89   "they ought to let women
90   show their pussies,
91   what harm does it
92   do?"


93   "the church is against
94   it."


95   "fuck the church."


96   we walked along
97   Main Street
98   as young as we were
99   ever going to
100   get.

        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   at one time
2   when I was 16
3   a few writers gave me
4   my only hope and
5   chance.


6   my father disliked
7   books and
8   my mother disliked
9   books (because my father
10   disliked books)
11   especially those I brought back
12   from the library:
13   D. H. Lawrence
14   Dostoevsky
15   Turgenev
16   Gorky
17   A. Huxley
18   Sinclair Lewis
19   others.


20   I had my own bedroom
21   but at 8 p.m.
22   we were all supposed to go to sleep:
23   "Early to bed and early to rise
24   makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise,"
25   my father would say.


26   "LIGHTS OUT!" he would shout.


27   then I would take the bed lamp
28   place it under the covers
29   and with the heat and hidden light
30   I would continue to read:
31   Ibsen
32   Shakespeare
33   Chekov
34   Jeffers

[Page 38 ]


35   Thurber
36   Conrad Aiken
37   others.


38   they gave me a chance and some hope
39   in a place of no chance
40   no hope, no feeling.


41   I worked for it.
42   it got hot under the covers.
43   sometimes the sheets would begin to smoke
44   then I'd switch the lamp off,
45   hold it outside to
46   cool off.


47   without those books
48   I'm not quite sure
49   how I would have turned
50   out:
51   raving; the
52   murderer of the father;
53   idiocy;
54   hopelessness.


55   when my father shouted
56   "LIGHTS OUT!"
57   I'm sure he feared
58   the well-written word
59   immortalized
60   forever
61   in our best and
62   most interesting
63   literature.


64   and it was there
65   for me
66   close to me
67   under the covers
68   more woman than woman
69   more man than man.

[Page 39 ]




70   I had it all
71   and
72   I took it.

        Bukowski, Charles :  mountain [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   in high school the classes were arranged alphabetically and Burns
2   was always seated behind me.
3   Burns: largest lad in the class of '39 but all of it was
4   fat.
5   he was a gross fat fart.


6   he was there on my neck, my back.
7   I could hear his wheezing.
8   I could hear him shifting his flesh about.


9   it was hell.
10   and worst of all the dumb fuck thought he was
11   clever.
12   always up to some trick.
13   like tapping me on the back, handing me a note,
14   whispering, "it's from Mary Lou ... she said to pass it
15   to you ..."


16   " /big boy/ ," said the note, " /I want to be with you so bad! I
can't/
17   /take my eyes off you!/ "


18   then he'd poke me in the back, "hey, hey, she wants you!"


19   I'd ignore him.


20   "hey, Hank, what did the priest say when he saw birdshit in
21   his popcorn?"


22   "hey, Hank ..."


23   on top of that he had body odor.
24   he always wore the same heavy green sweater,
25   even on the hottest day.


26   after each class he'd attempt to exit with me, follow me
27   down the hall.


28   "hey, Hank, wait a minute ..."

[Page 41 ]




29   he was slow, he had huge feet in square-toed black
30   shoes. they often banged together and he'd
31   stumble as he walked.


32   he was lonely but somehow I couldn't embrace his loneliness,
33   he made me feel physically and mentally
34   ill.


35   I had him hanging on my neck for two years.


36   then one day he poked me in the back: "hey, this one's
37   from Caroline ..."


38   I opened the note:
39   /"Henry, you are the yummy yummy man of my/
40   /dreams!"/


41   I turned in my seat and looked at him.
42   he wore round glasses with thick rims.
43   his red wet lips were twisted into an asinine
44   grin.


45   I said, "listen, Burns, if you ever touch me or
46   speak to me or even look at me again, I promise I am
47   going to kill you!"


48   Mrs. Anderson, the English teacher then said for
49   all to hear, "Mr. Chinaski, I'll see you after class."


50   afterwards she looked up at me from her
51   desk.


52   "I've watched that horseplay all term long. what do you
53   have to say about it?"


54   I didn't answer.


55   "Mr. Chinaski, I am going to give you an 'F' in English."


56   "all right ..."

[Page 42 ]




57   "you can go now."


58   I didn't attend English class after that but I saw Burns in
59   my other classes and since he didn't touch me or
60   speak to me and since I never saw him look at me, I
61   didn't have to kill him.


62   all I continued to hear was his wheezing.


63   and worse, I began to feel guilty as if I had committed a
64   hideous
65   wrong.


66   I felt as if I had locked him up in some terrible way, in some
67   dark and lonely place.


68   but I left him there, alone.


69   at my back, on my neck.


70   Class of Summer
71   '39.

        New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   is what they called them in the
2   R.O.T.C.
3   in the hills and fields on the
4   hottest summer days,
5   the Reds vs. Blues,
6   we had rifles but no bullets
7   and the officers had wooden sabers
8   and we'd run forward and
9   dive on our bellies,
10   take cover behind brush
11   while the general stood on the
12   hill,
13   he would be the final
14   judge as to who
15   won.
16   they were teaching us
17   how to kill each
18   other.
19   but the funniest thing was
20   when the opposing sides
21   happened to come upon
22   one another
23   unexpectedly,
24   the Reds and the Blues
25   (what told us apart were
26   the colored ribbons on
27   our rifles).
28   but I had long ago
29   torn mine off,
30   and we closed in
31   upon each other, got
32   excited,
33   began using rifle
34   butts
35   and the officers swung
36   their sabers about
37   each claiming victory
38   and there were bloody

[Page 44 ]


39   noses, fractured skulls.
40   one broken arm
41   and I sat under a
42   tree watching it
43   all
44   as high on the
45   hill
46   the general stood
47   looking through his
48   dusty
49   binoculars.
50   he was senile
51   and drooled
52   little goblets out of
53   each side of his
54   mouth.


55   Los Angeles, Calif.,
56   summer 1938.
57   Saturday.
58   death had a little
59   black moustache
60   and he waited for
61   us
62   and many of us
63   went.

        Bukowski, Charles :  what will the neighbors think? [from Bone
        Palace Ballet: New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I think that was the question asked most of me
2   by my parents.
3   of course, I didn't really care what the
4   neighbors thought.
5   I felt sorry for the neighbors, those frightened
6   people peeking from behind their
7   curtains.
8   the whole neighborhood was watching
9   itself
10   and in the 1930s there wasn't much else to
11   watch.
12   except me coming in drunk late at
13   night.


14   "this is going to kill your mother,"
15   my father told me,
16   "and besides what will the
17   neighbors think?"


18   me, I thought I was doing very well.
19   one way or the other
20   I managed to get drunk
21   without having any
22   money at all.
23   a trick that would stand me in good
24   stead
25   later in my life.


26   to make things worse for my poor
27   parents
28   I began to write letters to the
29   editor of one of the large
30   newspapers,
31   most of which were published
32   and all of which
33   backed unpopular causes.


34   "what will the neighbors think?"

[Page 46 ]


35   my parents asked
36   me.


37   but the letters brought interesting
38   results---hate letters, including
39   death threats through the
40   mails.
41   it also brought me into contact
42   with some weird
43   people who believed that I
44   meant what I had written in
45   those letters.


46   there were secret meetings
47   in cellars and attics,
48   there were guns, pacts,
49   plans,
50   speeches.
51   those were also
52   places where I scrounged up
53   free drinks.
54   most of these meetings
55   were attended by right-wingers,
56   young guys between the ages
57   of 17 and 23.
58   "we don't want blacks fucking
59   our women!
60   they must die!"
61   unfortunately
62   I wasn't fucking any
63   women myself.
64   all the meetings began by standing
65   and saluting the
66   flag
67   which I considered pretty
68   damned
69   juvenile.
70   but most of these young men
71   were from well-to-do
72   families

[Page 47 ]


73   and I drank with some of
74   them afterwards.
75   I drank as much as I could
76   as they ranted
77   on.
78   I never said anything
79   but they didn't seem to mind.
80   they remembered the letters
81   and had no idea that they
82   were false.
83   not that I was a decent
84   human being
85   but I wasn't aligned
86   with any group or
87   ideology.
88   actually the whole idea of
89   life and people
90   repulsed me
91   but it was easier to
92   scrounge drinks off the
93   right-wingers
94   than off old women
95   in the bars.


96   "I don't believe that you
97   are a son of mine,"
98   my father told me.


99   "what will the neighbors
100   think?" my mother
101   asked.


102   poor damned patriotic
103   deluded fools.


104   after they threw me out
105   of the house
106   I gave up
107   the meetings
108   and went and lived by myself in a

[Page 48 ]


109   plywood shack on
110   Bunker Hill.


111   and my parents no longer
112   had to worry about
113   what the
114   neighbors thought.

1   Sanford liked to play dirty
2   tricks like piss in milk bottles,
3   burn the legs off of spiders, torture
4   cats, put water in gas tanks, etc.


5   he was full of dirty
6   tricks.


7   we grew up together.


8   when World War II arrived he went into the
9   air force.


10   "the flyboys get all the pussy," he
11   told me.


12   on his second mission over the English
13   Channel they
14   blasted his ass out of the

16   they never found him.

        Bukowski, Charles :  a place in Philly [from Bone Palace Ballet:
        New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   there's nothing like being young
2   and starving,
3   living in a roominghouse and
4   pretending to be a
5   writer
6   while other men are occupied
7   with their professions and
8   their possessions.
9   there's nothing like being
10   young and
11   starving,
12   listening to Brahms,
13   your belly sucked-in,
14   nary an ounce of
15   fat,
16   stretched out on the bed
17   in the dark,
18   smoking a rolled
19   cigarette
20   and working on the
21   last bottle of
22   wine,
23   the sheets of your
24   writing strewn across the
25   floor.
26   you have walked on and across
27   them,
28   your masterpieces, and
29   either
30   they'll be read in
31   hell,
32   or perhaps
33   gnawed at by the
34   curious
35   mice.
36   Brahms is the only
37   friend you have,
38   the only friend you

[Page 54 ]


39   want,
40   him and the wine
41   bottle,
42   as you realize that
43   you will never
44   be a citizen of the
45   world,
46   and if you
47   live to be very
48   old
49   you still will never
50   be a citizen of the
51   world.
52   the wine and
53   Brahms mix well as
54   you watch the
55   lights
56   move across the
57   ceiling,
58   courtesy of
59   passing
60   automobiles.
61   soon you'll sleep
62   and
63   tomorrow there
64   certainly
65   will be
66   more
67   masterpieces.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the /Kenyon Review/ and other matters [from
        Bone Palace Ballet: New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   it was good being young but I didn't know it, a starving
2   jackass, stubborn beyond reason, reading that
3   tower of practiced literary horror, the /Kenyon Review/ .
4   somehow I admired their gamesmanship, their snobby word
5   play, their inbred docility.
6   I was lower class, depraved, a spectacle, a dissolute
7   slave
8   yet I was oddly charmed by their petty jousting, their
9   safe anger, their shield of learnedness;
10   to read this journal and others and then return to my small
11   room or the bars of night (most often that) to meet
12   another breed---club-fisted, bleary-eyed, cantankerous,
13   grubby, and joining them in their downward dance.
14   drink tempered our defeat, it warmed us, it heated us.
15   our only challenge was ourselves, no one would have
16   anything to do with us.
17   rallied and maddened by drink, I tested these in the
18   alleys, these bulls, these bears, these dumb bastards,
19   and they were good at war and I was not so bad.
20   it was a doing, a going on, nothing else.
21   our space was small and a bit unkind.


22   the next day to return to the library with a shut eye,
23   a swollen lip, skinned fingers, a wrist that hurt and
24   flamed like hell.


25   to turn more pages, to find them thinner and thinner, less
26   and less, like gossamer wings that would not hold
27   strong light, I was caught between nowhere and nowhere, I
28   sat at that library table caught between suicide and
29   acquiescence
30   I was no longer young; I was older than the centuries.


31   I closed the last book, the last magazine then.


32   I walked out of there.

33   the streets were all I saw.


34   I walked into
35   them.

        Bukowski, Charles :  big night on the town [from Bone Palace
        Ballet: New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   drunk on the dark streets of some city,
2   it's night, you're lost, where's your
3   room?
4   you enter a bar to find yourself,
5   order scotch and water.
6   damned bar's sloppy wet, it soaks
7   one of your shirt
8   sleeves.
9   it's a clip joint---the scotch is weak.
10   you order a bottle of beer.
11   Madame Death walks up to you
12   wearing a dress.
13   she sits down, you buy her a
14   beer, she stinks of swamps, presses
15   a leg against you.
16   the bartender sneers.
17   you've got him worried, he doesn't
18   know if you're a cop, a killer, a
19   madman or an
20   idiot.
21   you ask for a vodka.
22   you pour the vodka into the top of
23   the beer bottle.
24   it's one a.m. in a dead cow world.
25   you ask her how much for head,
26   drink everything down, it tastes
27   like machine oil.


28   you leave Madame Death there.
29   you leave the sneering bartender
30   there.


31   you have remembered where
32   your room is.
33   the room with the full bottle of
34   wine on the dresser.
35   the room with the dance of the
36   roaches.

        Bukowski, Charles :  total madness [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   all right, I know that you are tired of hearing
2   it
3   but how about this one last time?
4   all those tiny rooms in all those cities,
5   going from one city to another
6   from one cheap rented room to another
7   terrified and sickened of what people were.
8   it was the same any place and every place,
9   thousands and thousands of miles spent
10   looking out the window of a Greyhound bus,
11   listening to them talk, looking at them,
12   their heads, their ears, the way they walked.
13   these were strangers from somewhere else,
14   lifeless parallel perpendiculars,
15   they drove the blade through my gut,
16   even the lovely girls,
17   with guile of eye, with the lilt and magic of
18   their bodies
19   where only a down payment on a
20   mirage,
21   life's cheap trick.


22   I went from room to room
23   from city to city,
24   hiding, looking, waiting ...
25   for what?
26   for nothing but the
27   irresponsible and negative
28   desire
29   to at least
30   not be like
31   /them/ .


32   I loved those old rooms,
33   the worn rugs,
34   the walk down the hall
35   to the bathroom,
36   even the rats and the

[Page 60 ]


37   mice and the roaches
38   were comrades ...


39   and along the way
40   somehow I discovered
41   the classical composers.


42   I had an old record player.
43   and rather than eat
44   I used what funds I had
45   for cheap wine and
46   record albums.
47   and I rolled cigarettes,
48   smoked, drank,
49   listened to the music
50   in the dark.
51   I remember one particular
52   night
53   when Wagner really
54   lifted the ceiling off
55   my room
56   I got up
57   out of bed
58   joy-stricken,
59   I stood there and lifted
60   both arms toward the
61   ceiling
62   and I caught sight of
63   myself in the dresser
64   mirror
65   and there was nothing left
66   of me,
67   a skeleton of a man,
68   down from 200 pounds to
69   130,
70   with sunken
71   cheeks.
72   I saw this death skull
73   looking at me
74   and it was so

[Page 61 ]


75   ridiculous and so lovely
76   that I started to laugh
77   and the thing in the mirror
78   laughed back
79   and it got
80   funnier and funnier
81   as I lifted my arms
82   higher toward the
83   ceiling.


84   and along with those old
85   rooms,
86   I was lucky,
87   I had gentle old landladies,
88   with pictures of
89   Christ on the stairways,
90   but they were always nice
91   in spite of that.


92   "Mr. Chinaski, your rent is
93   overdue, are you all
94   right?"


95   "oh, yes, thank you."


96   "I hear your music playing,
97   night and day,
98   you sit in your room night
99   and day with the shades
100   pulled down ...
101   are you all right?"


102   "I'm a writer."


103   "a writer?"


104   "yes, I just sent something
105   to the /New Yorker/
106   I'm sure I'll be hearing from
107   them any day now."

[Page 62 ]




108   somehow if you told them
109   you were a writer
110   they would put up with all
111   sorts of
112   excuses,
113   especially if you were
114   in your early
115   twenties.
116   (later on, it was a hard
117   sell
118   as I was to
119   find out.)


120   but I loved those
121   small rooms in all of
122   those cities with all
123   of those landladies
124   and Brahms
125   and Sibelius
126   and Shostakovich
127   and Ives
128   and Sir Edward Elgar
129   and the Chopin Etudes
130   and Borodin
131   Beethoven
132   Hayden
133   Handel
134   Moussorgsky,
135   etc.


136   now, somehow, after
137   decades of
138   those rooms
139   and half-assed barren

147   here,
148   to recount to you
149   once more
150   the wonder of
151   my madness
152   then.


153   the difference now
154   being
155   that while my writing hasn't

        Bukowski, Charles :  on the bum [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   moving from city to city
2   I always had two pairs of
3   shoes,
4   my looking-for-work
5   shoes and my working
6   shoes.


7   my work shoes were
8   heavy and black
9   and stiff.
10   sometimes when I
11   first put them on
12   they were very
13   painful,
14   the toe
15   hardened and
16   twisted
17   but I'd get them
18   on
19   on a hangover
20   morning,
21   thinking, well,
22   here we go
23   again
24   working for
25   miserable wages
26   and expected to
27   be grateful
28   for that
29   (having been chosen
30   from a score of
31   applicants).
32   it was probably my
33   ugly and
34   honest
35   face.


36   putting on

[Page 65 ]


37   those shoes
38   again
39   was always
40   another hard
41   beginning.


42   I
43   imagined myself
44   somehow
45   escaping
46   it all.
47   making it at the
48   gaming table
49   or in the
50   ring
51   or in the bed
52   of some rich
53   lady.


54   maybe I got
55   that notion from
56   living too long in
57   Los Angeles,
58   a place far too
59   close to
60   Hollywood.


61   but going down
62   those roominghouse
63   steps
64   with each new
65   beginning,
66   the stiff shoes
67   murdering my
68   feet,
69   stepping out into
70   the early
71   sun,
72   the sidewalk
73   there,

[Page 66 ]


74   the city
75   there
76   and I was just one
77   more
78   common laborer,
79   one more
80   common
81   man,
82   the universe
83   sliding through
84   my head
85   and out my
86   ears,
87   the timecard waiting
88   to check me in
89   and out,
90   and afterwards
91   something to
92   drink and the
93   ladies from
94   hell.


95   work shoes
96   work shoes
97   work shoes
98   and me
99   inside of
100   them with
101   all the lights
102   turned
103   out.

        Bukowski, Charles :  society should realize ... [from Bone
        Palace Ballet: New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   you consult psychiatrists and philosophers
2   when things aren't going well
3   and whores when they are.
4   the whores are there for young boys and old
5   men; to the young boys they say,
6   "don't be frightened, honey, here I'll put it
7   in for you."
8   and for the old guys
9   they put on an act
10   like you're really hooking it home.
11   society should realize the value of the
12   whore---I mean, those girls who really enjoy their
13   work---those who make it almost an
14   art form.


15   I'm thinking of the time
16   in a Mexican whorehouse
17   this gal with her little bowl and her rag
18   washing my dick,
19   and it got hard and she laughed and I
20   laughed and she
21   kissed it, gently and slowly, then she walked over and
22   spread out
23   on the bed
24   and I got on and we worked easily, no effort, no
25   tension, and some guy beat on the door and
26   yelled,
27   "Hey! what the hell's going on in there?
28   Hurry it up!"
29   but it was like a Mahler symphony---you just don't
30   rush
31   it.


32   when I finished and she came back, there was
33   the bowl and the rag again
34   and we both laughed; then she kissed it
35   gently and
36   slowly, and I got up and put my clothes back on and

[Page 68 ]


37   walked out---
38   "Jesus, buddy, what the hell were ya doin' in
39   there?"
40   "Fuckin'," I told the gentleman
41   and walked down the hall and down the steps and stood
42   outside in the road and lit one of those
43   sweet Mexican cigarettes in the moonlight.
44   liberated and human again
45   for a mere $3, I
46   loved the night, Mexico and
47   myself.

        Bukowski, Charles :  madman [from Bone Palace Ballet: New Poems
        (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   while
2   being
3   checked into the L.A. City jail (I
4   was still a bit drunk)
5   there was a crowd of prisoners waiting and
6   nobody noticed me smoking a cigarette
7   until some ash dropped off the end
8   then a cop screamed at me about how
9   "we kept this fucking place CLEAN!"
10   "oh," I said, and then the cop said,
11   "wise fucker, huh? ... O.K., now you
12   /get/ it!"
13   and he pushed me into a back room and
14   locked the door behind
15   me.
16   there behind a thick yellow floor-to-ceiling
17   wire screen was this total
18   madman
19   he saw me and screamed
20   ran violently toward me
21   smashed into the wire screen
22   bounced back
23   rushed the wire again
24   grabbing it
25   shaking it
26   wanting to get through it
27   trying to get at me
28   trying to kill me


29   it was frightening
30   but I was drunk
31   found another cigarette
32   lit it trembling
33   pushed it through the wire
34   expecting to get my hand ripped
35   off
36   he took the smoke
37   put it to his lips

[Page 70 ]


38   inhaled
39   exhaled


40   I lit up
41   also
42   and we stood there together
43   smoking.


44   that's the way the cop
45   found us
46   when he opened the door
47   behind
48   me.


49   "son of a bitch," he said, "that's
50   beautiful, I wish I could let
51   you go for that."


52   "I wish you could too,"
53   I told him.


54   "come on," he
55   said.


56   as we walked out the door
57   the madman grabbed the wire again and
58   screamed
59   screamed
60   screamed
61   he rattled and banged the
62   wire
63   that thick wire
64   with the yellow paint flaking off
65   revealing the
66   pale grey paint
67   underneath.

        Bukowski, Charles :  16 Jap machine gun bullets [from Bone
        Palace Ballet: New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   Norman
2   Jimmy
3   Max killed in World War II
4   while I hid in old roominghouses
5   in Philadelphia and San
6   Francisco
7   listening to
8   Mozart and Bach.


9   others fared differently:
10   with George it was a bad
11   liver. Dale died of misled
12   ambition. Nick went the common hard way of
13   cancer.
14   Harry of a
15   wife and 5 beautiful children.


16   Jimmy had it right---
17   trying to bring that bomber back to
18   England with the motors shot
19   out. Norman had it
20   right---
21   taking 3 hours to die from
22   16 Jap machine gun bullets.


23   now we've all got it quite right---
24   sitting around reading the
25   comic strips
26   drinking warm wine and
27   rolling smokes.
28   at 6 in the evening we charm our blood and
29   our manner
30   as we walk our faces through the
31   spiderwebs.


32   we've got it right
33   we've got it right---
34   the raven and the waves

[Page 74 ]


35   the tired sunsets and the tired
36   people---
37   it takes a lifetime to die and
38   no time at
39   all.


[Page 75 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  bar stool [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   each day and each night were
2   about the same.
3   the bartender let me in at
4   5 a.m.
5   I had to listen to his stories
6   as he mopped the place up
7   and got things
8   ready
9   but the drinks were free
10   until 7 a.m. when the bar
11   opened.


12   the 7 a.m. crowd was a
13   good one,
14   I could usually work them
15   for some drinks
16   but by 8:15 a.m. there were
17   few patrons left.
18   I had to nurse my drinks
19   and wait.


20   I used the few coins I had
21   to keep the drinks slowly
22   arriving.
23   the painful time came
24   when I ran out of
25   coin.
26   the trick was to never
27   empty your glass.
28   it was a rule: as long as
29   you had something in
30   your glass you
31   stayed.


32   sometimes the time
33   really bludgeoned
34   me
35   and my damned

[Page 76 ]


36   tongue was hanging
37   out too.


38   at noon a few
39   more would drift in,
40   they all knew
41   me.
42   I put on a good
43   late night
44   show---
45   wild sentences of
46   gibberish,
47   fist fights,
48   even a few
49   profound
50   statements,
51   and the times
52   I had money
53   I bought for
54   everybody.
55   I was the nut.
56   the good guy.
57   the bad
58   guy.
59   but in the daylight
60   hours I had
61   no zip.
62   those were the
63   hard hours.
64   I had to milk
65   those drab suckers
66   for
67   drinks.
68   one way or the other
69   I got them,
70   ran errands,
71   got a little
72   coin.


73   as the afternoon

[Page 77 ]


74   went toward
75   evening
76   things began to
77   get better,
78   I got drunker,
79   more inventive,
80   more interesting,
81   it got into party
82   time,
83   goodluck
84   time.


85   and the nights
86   were great.
87   drinks arrived
88   before me
89   and I had no
90   idea where they
91   had
92   come
93   from.


94   sometimes the
95   nights and the days
96   got mixed up.
97   I seemed to be
98   sitting in daylight
99   and then it was
100   dark all at once,
101   or it worked the
102   other way around,
103   it was dark
104   and in the next
105   moment
106   it was daylight.


107   I once asked the
108   bartender, "hey,
109   Jim, did you notice
110   that it was dark

[Page 78 ]


111   and now the sun
112   is shining!
113   isn't that strange?"


114   "no," he answered,
115   "you went to your
116   room and then came
117   back again."


118   at times I resented
119   my role.
120   the patrons were
121   hardly intellectual,
122   there was a lifeless
123   and satisfied deadness
124   about them
125   and yet I had to
126   depend upon their
127   whims.
128   I was on
129   that bar stool for
130   3 years from 5 a.m.
131   to 2 a.m.
132   I must have slept
133   while I drank.
134   I believe that I was
135   trying to kill myself
136   with drink and
137   back alley
138   brawls
139   but it wasn't
140   working.
141   my greatest problem
142   were my toenails
143   which I never
144   cut
145   and which pained
146   me in my
147   shoes.
148   but eventually

[Page 79 ]


149   they broke off
150   or the whole
151   nail would fall
152   off
153   leaving that
154   tender flesh
155   plus
156   a few split
157   lips,
158   mangled fingers,
159   lumps on the
160   knee
161   from falling,
162   and that was the
163   extent of
164   it.


165   I was evicted from
166   room after room
167   but always managed
168   to find
169   another.


170   it was as good a
171   life as I could
172   eke out.


173   I was avoiding
174   becoming ensnared
175   in a common
176   manner of
177   living.
178   I truly believed
179   that this was
180   important to me
181   when everything
182   else was
183   not.


184   and the one

[Page 80 ]


185   stool was
186   mine.


187   the one down
188   at the end of
189   the
190   bar.


191   it was all that
192   I owned.
193   it was all that
194   I needed.


195   there was no
196   other man
197   I preferred to be
198   or no
199   other way that
200   I preferred.


201   I was at the
202   peak of my
203   courage,
204   sitting there
205   waiting for
206   that next
207   drink.
208   do you see
209   what I
210   mean?

        Bukowski, Charles :  the mirror game [from Bone Palace Ballet:
        New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   Peter was a freak, Peter was fat, Peter
2   was dumb, Peter was clumsy, Peter stuttered
3   and Peter stumbled and the girls giggled at
4   Peter and the boys taunted him, and Peter
5   was often kept after school and Peter's glasses
6   always fell off and his shoe-
7   laces were untied and his shirttail hung
8   out and his clothing was unlike anything
9   we'd ever seen and Peter always sat
10   in a back seat in class with snot running
11   from his nose.


12   that was then. that was grammar school and
13   junior high, and time went
14   on and
15   now
16   Peter never drives his expensive car more than
17   one year and he always has a new and
18   beautiful girlfriend and he no longer wears
19   glasses and he has thinned down, looks al-
20   most handsome but certainly assured, he
21   has a home in Mexico and a home in Holly-
22   wood.
23   Peter deals in art work and the stock
24   market, he speaks three languages, has a
25   yacht and a private plane and he also
26   sometimes produces movies.


27   those who knew him then don't know him
28   now.
29   something
30   happened, what the hell
31   was it?


32   and most of the golden boys of yore
33   who are still around now
34   are misshapen, beaten, inglorious,
35   idiotic, homeless, senile or

[Page 82 ]


36   dying.


37   it seldom works the way we think it
38   works.
39   in fact, it never
40   does.

        Bukowski, Charles :  liar, liar, pants on fire! [from Bone
        Palace Ballet: New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   bunch of guys sitting there drinking and Louie
2   started in, said he was in this bedroom
3   working out when the woman under him said,
4   "It's my husband! I hear his key in the front
5   door!"
6   Louie jumped up, there was only one way
7   out, through the bathroom window, it was
8   two floors up but he went for it anyhow,
9   leaving his pants, his shirt, shoes, everything there,
10   he climbed out the window, ass-naked, and
11   let himself down by the drainpipe.
12   three quarters of the way down he fell to the
13   ground, got up with a sprained and twisted
14   ankle and hobbled to his car
15   which was parked in back and drove off
16   with a roar, away into the night totally
17   naked but still alive!


18   the guys laughed, "Man, Louie, you got
19   away with it!"


20   the way I saw it, Louie couldn't have
21   started his car without his
22   pants with the keys in them.
23   I knew that I could expose him, but
24   what was the good?


25   another fellow with a bullshit

        Bukowski, Charles :  the inspection [from Bone Palace Ballet:
        New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   it was a small dusty town in east Texas
2   full of wild turkeys.
3   I had just married the
4   daughter
5   and they had come to her
6   house to see who I
7   was.
8   all the relatives and the
9   devil knows
10   who else.


11   now it was over
12   and I was sitting on the
13   edge of the bed
14   sucking on a beer
15   bottle
16   and my wife stood
17   there.


18   "they liked you,"
19   she said.


20   "yeah?"


21   "they expected some city
22   boy, not
23   you."


24   "ah?"


25   "you drank more
26   whiskey than any of
27   them, even Uncle
28   Paul, and you
29   didn't even
30   blink."


31   "it was good

[Page 85 ]


32   whiskey."


33   "you're accepted," said my
34   wife. "they won't
35   bother us."


36   "are they supposed
37   to?"


38   "they ran off my
39   last one? ..."


40   "your last one?
41   wait a minute
42   here ..."


43   "we were engaged."


44   "anybody I know?"


45   she laughed.


46   "also, when they used
47   the word 'nigger' you
48   didn't protest."


49   "I thought they were
50   talking to me.
51   hell, baby, I'm a
52   nigger."


53   I walked to the
54   kitchen and got
55   another beer.
56   all the whiskey
57   was gone.


58   when I got back
59   she was standing
60   there

[Page 86 ]


61   smiling.


62   "but you know,"
63   she said, "what
64   made the
65   /biggest/ hit?"


66   "no, tell me ..."


67   "it was when you walked
68   out wearing those filthy
69   blue jeans!"


70   "yeah?"


71   "oh, yes!
72   they won't chase you off
73   now!"


74   I had passed
75   muster.

77   begin.

        Bukowski, Charles :  somewhere in Texas [from Bone Palace
        Ballet: New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   sitting in a big ranch house with a grandmother
2   and a grandfather (not mine) and the grandmother
3   tells me she has "terrible migraines" and doesn't
4   know what to do.
5   I know she has one then and the reason is
6   that I am sitting in her house.
7   the grandfather asks me if I want a drink and I tell
8   him yes and he pours me a whiskey and
9   water
10   and my wife walks out and says, "don't start him
11   too early, it leads to trouble."
12   I slam the drink down, look at the grandfather, ask,
13   "how about another just like that last one?"
14   my wife walks away.
15   the afternoon winds down as I sit drinking with gramps
16   and then gramps falls asleep in his chair and I help
17   myself to more.
18   I sit with the setting sun in my eyes and it feels
19   good.
20   after a while I walk into the yard and there's an
21   Indian.
22   I sit on the ground and watch him build a
23   chicken coop.
24   after a while I ask him, "want a drink?"
25   he says no.
26   a no-fun guy.
27   I walk back into the house.
28   grandpop is still asleep.
29   grandma still has her migraine.
30   I walk through the house.
31   I walk back to the bedroom.
32   my wife is standing there.
33   "you son-of-a-bitch," she says.
34   "of course," I say.
35   I flop down on the bed, look up at the
36   ceiling.
37   among the cracks I make out an angel, a goat and a
38   lion.

[Page 88 ]


39   my wife walks out of the room.
40   I wonder what they pay the Indian.
41   not much: room, board, a pot to piss
42   in.
43   I decide to sleep.
44   maybe later that night things would look
45   better.

        Bukowski, Charles :  city boy [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I stopped in Wyoming to drink in a bar
2   in Cheyenne.
3   maybe I looked Los Angeles.
4   one guy at the bar asked another,
5   "you wearin' boots?"
6   and the other guy answered,
7   "yeah, I'm wearin' boots."
8   I was sitting between them and
9   they talked around me.
10   "I don't think you're wearin' boots,"
11   the first guy said.
12   "well, I am," the other guy answered.
13   then it got quiet and they just looked at
14   each other.


15   I took a hit of my beer bottle,
16   set it down.


17   "nobody asked me," I said, "but
18   I'm going to tell you anyhow.
19   I've never worn boots and I hope that I
20   go to my grave never wearing
21   boots."


22   "maybe that can be arranged,"
23   said the first guy.


24   "that's possible," I said, "but who's
25   going to arrange it?"


26   "oh, that won't be any problem,"
27   said the first guy.


28   "it's at least going to cause some kind
29   of a problem, don't you think?" I said.


30   "no, not much."

[Page 90 ]




31   "well, maybe not, but I am kind of
32   curious. who's going to do the
33   arranging? you?"


34   "maybe."


35   "you're going to let me wonder,
36   huh?"


37   "yep."


38   "well, while I'm wondering, I think I'll
39   have a drink of whiskey.
40   hey, bartender!"


41   this big guy came ambling down.


42   "yeah?"


43   "will you please pour me a shot of
44   whiskey to wonder over?"


45   he ambled off to get it.


46   it got quiet in there.


47   my whiskey came ambling back.


48   I slammed it down.


49   "I kind of like this town," I said, "I think
50   I'll stay awhile."


51   "maybe," said the guy who had been
52   doing all the talking.


53   "you're full of maybies," I said.
54   "How'd you get that way?"


55   "maybe I'm not going to tell

[Page 91 ]


56   you."


57   then it was quiet again, there were
58   6 or 7 guys in that
59   bar.


60   I took a hit of my beer.


61   then I looked at the other guy
62   sitting next to me.


63   "you're not wearing boots,"
64   I told him.


65   "didn't say I was."


66   then it got very quiet.
67   everybody just sat there.


68   it stayed quiet.


69   "bartender," I said finally, "a round of drinks
70   for everybody."


71   they were all drinking beer.


72   the bartender went about setting up
73   new beers.
74   then he was finished.


75   I put some bills on the bar.
76   the bartender came down and
77   took all of them.


78   he walked down to the register,
79   hit it and dropped my money
80   into it.
81   then he took a rag and mopped
82   the bar.

[Page 92 ]




83   I got up and walked to the
84   door.
85   then I turned and looked.


86   the bartender was still mopping
87   the bar.
88   the other guys just sat
89   looking straight ahead.


90   I turned and walked out
91   of the bar.


92   nobody said
93   goodbye.


[Page 93 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  the strange morning outside the bar [from
        Bone Palace Ballet: New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   it had never happened before and one doesn't
2   know how such things can
3   happen.


4   it was about 11 a.m. and I had stopped
5   outside for some air.
6   Danny walked up and I started talking
7   to Danny.
8   then Harry walked up and joined us
9   on the corner.


10   then I noticed two other men
11   stop and begin talking
12   to each other a few feet away.


13   "let's go in for a drink," I said to
14   Danny and Harry.


15   "no, it's nice out here," said Danny,
16   "let's gab awhile."


17   so we did.


18   then I noticed some more men
19   arrive.
20   some were talking, others
21   just stood there.


22   it happened slowly.


23   more and more men arrived
24   at the corner.


25   it was getting crowded.


26   it was getting almost
27   humorous.

[Page 94 ]


28   there was something
29   strange in the air,
30   you could feel it.


31   there were many voices
32   now.
33   and more men arrived.
34   I don't know where they
35   came from.


36   they stood around
37   talking,
38   laughing,
39   and smoking
40   cigarettes.


41   Jim the bartender stuck
42   his head out the door
43   and asked,
44   "hey, what the hell's
45   going on out here?"


46   somebody laughed.


47   Jim went back inside to
48   the empty bar.


49   I began to feel very
50   strange about it all,
51   as if the world had
52   decided to change,
53   all at once.


54   there was a feeling of
55   joy and gamble in
56   the air.
57   I believe that everybody
58   felt it.


59   it was a powerful energy

[Page 95 ]


60   let loose and working
61   upon itself.


62   then Jack the cop
63   walked up.
64   "hey, you guys,
65   break it up!
66   what the hell is all
67   this?"


68   we all knew Jack,
69   we drank with him
70   at night.


71   soon Jack was standing there
72   talking and listening
73   to the others.


74   Danny grinned, "Jesus,
75   this is very strange."


76   "I like it," I said.


77   the whole corner was
78   crowded with
79   humanity
80   finally cut loose and
81   free,
82   laughing.


83   cars slowed down and the
84   drivers looked out
85   wondering what was
86   happening.
87   we didn't
88   know.


89   finally I said,
90   "I can't stand this
91   anymore, I'm going in

[Page 96 ]


92   for a drink."


93   Danny and Harry
94   followed me
95   in.


96   soon a few others
97   followed.


98   "lot of guys out there,"
99   said the bartender.


100   "yeah," said Harry, "but
101   where are the
102   women?"


103   "the women don't
104   want anything to do
105   with bums like us,"
106   said Danny.


107   we each had a couple
108   of drinks.
109   it took maybe 15 or
110   20 minutes.


111   then I went to the
112   door and looked
113   out.
114   everybody was
115   gone.


116   I came back and
117   sat down.


118   "wonder where they
119   went?"


120   "strangest morning of
121   my life," said

[Page 97 ]


122   Danny.


123   "yeah," said
124   Harry.


125   we sat there thinking
126   about it.
127   then Danny started
128   talking about how his
129   parents were going to
130   throw him out for
131   too much
132   drinking.


133   Jim the bartender
134   stood there polishing
135   glasses
136   and things were back
137   to normal,
138   even to wondering
139   who was going to
140   buy the next
141   round.

        Bukowski, Charles :  a $15 boy and a $1500 casket [from Bone
        Palace Ballet: New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   We can get you a nice boy with
2   soprano voice to sing behind a purple
3   curtain for just
4   $15, and I say
5   all right
6   all right, and my uncle says,
7   men like mahogany, you ought to get him the
8   mahogany, and I think,
9   doesn't he realize that this man is dead?
10   all right, I say.
11   the mahogany is $1500.


12   a day or so later
13   outside the parlor
14   getting a coffee
15   I meet my father's best friend
16   who tells me all his
17   troubles, and I say,
18   look, Bert, hate to interrupt you, but
19   I think I'm late, and
20   I run across the street
21   with Bert behind me,
22   and sure, they were waiting for me,
23   and I sat down and they
24   began.


25   they had the lid open on the coffin
26   and my $15 boy began to
27   sing, but I'd always hated my father,
28   still did, and then they lined up
29   to walk past his
30   coffin. I was the last, being the
31   son.


32   I should spit on his phoney face,
33   I thought, but then his girlfriend
34   who was right ahead of me
35   started weeping, moaning and

[Page 99 ]


36   lifted that dead head up out of the coffin
37   and started kissing that dead head,
38   those dead lips.


39   well, the old boy had finally turned out to be
40   a lady's man.


41   I really didn't care
42   but I reached over and pulled the heads apart,
43   the dead one and the living one,
44   pushed her off, watched the old man's head
45   flop back into the casket,
46   not so nice now,
47   the rouge and powder smeared,
48   the cotton in the jaws pushed around,
49   lines and age showing, I knew I'd soon be dead too
50   but what a hell of a way to do it,
51   a $15 boy and a $1500 casket
52   when everybody knew what a son-of-a-bitch he
53   had been,
54   and when I walked down the steps
55   there she was
56   after kissing the dead head of that son-of-a-bitch,
57   she grabbed me, kissed me, sobbing
58   she tongued me
59   managing to say,
60   you look just like him, and
61   that made me mad
62   and I pushed her off
63   walked down the steps
64   drove to Santa Anita
65   met a high yellow
66   won $185
67   went to her place
68   had steak salad whiskey beer talk
69   went to bed together
70   and did it
71   several times


72   that was some years ago

[Page 100 ]


73   but now every time I drive past that street
74   where she lived---
75   Irolo Street---


76   I think, yes the kissing of the dead head
77   the sleeping with the high yellow
78   the good day at the track
79   mahogany uncles be damned,
80   you worked with what was
81   left and forgot everything
82   else, which is the kindest way for
83   all of us.


[Page 101 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  rosary [from Bone Palace Ballet: New Poems
        (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   my father was a man full of small
2   sayings:


3   "early to bed and early to
4   rise ..."


5   "a fool and his money ..."


6   "you made your bed now lie in
7   it ..."


8   "a penny saved is ..."


9   "do as I say, not as I have
10   done ..."


11   "if you don't succeed, suck
12   eggs ..."


13   there were others but I have
14   forgotten them.
15   how he would toll them off,
16   endlessly!


17   when he died I went to look at
18   him in his casket.
19   everybody talked about how good
20   he looked, " /peaceful!/ look at him,
21   how /peaceful!/ they've fixed him up
22   real nice!"


23   I just looked at him
24   almost expecting him to pop off
25   one of his sayings:


26   "a dead ass is better than no
27   ass at all ..."

[Page 102 ]




28   "don't you wonder where I'm chasing
29   daffodils now?"


30   but nothing happened so I walked
31   away
32   followed by uncle
33   who said, "hey, Henry, let's
34   go get something to eat!"


35   "I know just the place," I said.
36   "follow
37   me ..."


38   I could almost hear him saying
39   from the casket:


40   "the way to a man's heart is
41   through his
42   stomach ..."


[Page 103 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  the smirking dark [from Bone Palace Ballet:
        New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   when I buried my father, death stood there
2   and afterwards I got into my old car and drove
3   to the racetrack
4   and I stood there and watched the numbers flash
5   on the toteboard
6   and death still stood there
7   looking at all the people.
8   and I said, "you killed Dostoevsky."
9   he didn't answer, he just stood there.
10   I made a bet and lost, went to the men's room.
11   death followed me, stood there watching the men
12   at the urinals.
13   "you son-of-a-bitch," I said, "you made Van Gogh
14   blow himself away."
15   he didn't answer me.
16   then he followed me out.
17   he walked away, following a young girl in a red
18   dress.
19   I went and got a coffee, spilled some of it over
20   my fingers, it was hot.
21   I found a seat and thought about the next
22   race.
23   then death was back.
24   he was sitting next to me disguised as an old
25   guy with a scraggly white beard.
26   "who do you like in the next race?" he asked.
27   "you son-of-a-bitch," I said, "get away from
28   me!"
29   "what the hell's wrong with you?"
30   he asked.
31   "I told you, get the fuck away from
32   me!"
33   he got up and moved
34   off.


35   I didn't see him anymore at the
36   track.
37   after the last race

[Page 104 ]


38   I took the freeway on in.


39   after 3 miles traffic began to
40   slow down.
41   I stayed in the left lane and
42   rode it out.


43   then I saw it,
44   on the other side of the freeway
45   fence---
46   a pile-up, bad,
47   one car on its roof,
48   another crushed on the freeway
49   fence,
50   a flame was beginning to flicker under
51   the hood, red lights came flashing
52   and inside my gut
53   something sucked and banged.


54   I drove past.
55   I drove on.


56   I parked outside my place,
57   got out, went in.
58   I opened the door.
59   there was nobody there.


60   then I saw the teddy bear.
61   it was pushed face-down into the pillow
62   on the bed.


63   I walked quickly to the stocking
64   drawer where the money was
65   kept.
66   my shipping clerk money.


67   only half of it was gone.


68   nice, I thought.

[Page 105 ]




69   real class, you bitch.


70   then the door opened and death
71   walked in.


72   "care for a drink?" I asked
73   him.


74   he didn't answer.


75   I walked to the kitchen to see
76   if there was one.


77   the centuries flashed
78   by.


79   as he stood
80   waiting.

        Bukowski, Charles :  two crazies [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   we were the only two whites in the
2   factory.
3   he was real crazy, Max,
4   cocked neck, gangly thin arms, never
5   looked straight at anybody, well, he did
6   but it was only a quick glance from
7   atop a twisted neck and his eyes
8   were small and ugly and
9   dim, and he always wore brown:
10   brown shoes, brown shirt, brown
11   pants, brown socks
12   and his movements were
13   ungainly.
14   nobody ever spoke to him.
15   I was the other crazy
16   but the other workers didn't know
17   it.
18   I had a mean mouth, was good
19   with the quips and it gained me
20   some respect
21   but I was as out of it as
22   Max was.
23   I knew exactly how Max felt
24   and I think he knew how I felt
25   but it was a secret between
26   us.
27   we never spoke.
28   months went by and we never
29   spoke.
30   then one afternoon he spoke.
31   he turned and looked at me
32   and said, "you don't have any
33   guts."


34   at lunch time we squared off
35   in the alley behind the shop.
36   Max rushed me, winging punches
37   but they were butterfly

[Page 107 ]


38   punches.
39   I took him easy, bloodied his
40   nose right away, then just
41   started leveling off.
42   it was like fighting a girl.
43   he didn't have
44   it.
45   the fellows pulled me
46   away.
47   we went back in
48   and Max went to the
49   washroom to clean
50   himself up.


51   nothing happened between
52   Max and myself
53   after that.
54   a month went by
55   and one day Max didn't
56   show up
57   and we never saw him
58   again.


59   a week or so later
60   I was fired.


61   and both the crazy whites
62   were gone.


63   Max had been
64   right:
65   I didn't have any guts.
66   I was shacked with a woman
67   ten years older
68   and I was
69   pussy-whipped
70   and lost in my own dream.
71   and if that ain't crazy,
72   I'd rather
73   be.

        Bukowski, Charles :  a note on the masses [from Bone Palace
        Ballet: New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   private hells made public
2   often puzzle the readers:
3   they wonder how this one
4   or that one
5   can endure and
6   continue.
7   well, there's a secret:
8   don't expect too
9   much of Humanity,
10   they have been
11   practicing hatred
12   for centuries,
13   it's passed down
14   refined and
15   perfected,
16   oh, they have become
17   very good at that---
18   their hatreds blossom
19   with ever more frequent
20   regularity.
21   our public hell creates a
22   private hell and
23   there is no hell
24   except on
25   earth.
26   once you accept
27   this premise
28   you will be free to
29   exist
30   on your own terms
31   and you will never
32   know loneliness
33   and death will be as
34   nothing.
35   consider yourself
36   blessed in the
37   dark.

        Bukowski, Charles :  Lord Byron [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   he looked like Lord Byron
2   (or he said he did)
3   I don't know what Byron
4   looked like
5   I couldn't even read
6   him,
7   but Albert was tall,
8   fairly well-built
9   and he had bright
10   yellow hair,
11   a whole mane of it,
12   and his eyes were a
13   fierce blue
14   and he had a well-
15   modulated English
16   accent
17   and dozens of
18   women.
19   he professed to be
20   a writer
21   but I never saw
22   any of it.
23   I have no idea
24   where his income
25   came
26   from.
27   but he always lived
28   in well-furnished
29   apartments
30   with some young
31   lady of
32   education.
33   and as I saw him
34   on and off
35   through the years,
36   he became older
37   but his ladies
38   remained

[Page 112 ]


39   the same
40   age: 22, 23,
41   24.


42   if there is a point
43   to all this
44   (and there may
45   not be) well, it was
46   that Albert loved
47   to drink
48   and I was perhaps
49   the best
50   drinker he knew
51   and he would
52   invite me over
53   to imbibe with
54   him.


55   it may have been
56   the contrast---
57   I was ugly and
58   crass, I'm sure
59   I made him look
60   all the better
61   to his ladies.


62   so I would crank
63   up the old car
64   and drive over for
65   the free
66   booze.


67   it was always about
68   the same:
69   Lord Byron couldn't
70   hold his drink,
71   kept running to the
72   bathroom to puke,
73   even though I was
74   outdrinking him

[Page 113 ]


75   3 to one.


76   at
77   puking time,
78   I would make a
79   play for his
80   lady.


81   "come on, babe,
82   let's work in a
83   quicky while he vomits his
84   guts out on the
85   tiles and in the
86   toilet."


87   "you are
88   disgusting!"


89   "thank you,
90   mam."


91   then Albert would
92   exit pale from the
93   bathroom,
94   go to the bookcase,
95   pull out the work
96   of Keats or Shelley,
97   read us
98   one.
99   or he would go to
100   his sound system
101   and gift us with a
102   bit of
103   Vivaldi.


104   Lord Byron and I were
105   direct opposites:
106   he too sensitive to
107   live in the world
108   and I too thick to

[Page 114 ]


109   understand his
110   pain.


111   but I was poor and
112   the drinks were
113   free
114   and I got to look up
115   the finely crossed legs
116   of his numerous
117   ladies,
118   so it was a fair
119   trade.


120   until true to his
121   delicate calling
122   he suicided one hangover
123   morning
124   after finding
125   a purse full of
126   pills
127   belonging to one
128   of his ladies
129   and I had to find another
130   poet to
131   milk free drinks
132   outa.

1   are always proclaiming that
2   they are now going to concentrate
3   on their /work/ , which is usually
4   painting or writing.
5   it is known, of course, that they have
6   talent, they simply haven't ... well ...
7   they haven't truly been given a
8   chance.
9   there were matters that got
10   in the way: bad affairs, children,
11   jobs, illness, etc.
12   but now, that's all put aside, they
13   proclaim.
14   they are going to concentrate
15   on their work
16   they are finally going to do it
17   now.
18   they have the talent.
19   now the world will see.
20   oh yes, it's going to happen.


21   the proclaimers are everywhere.
22   they are always getting
23   ready.
24   they seldom begin.
25   and when they do
26   they quit easily.
27   it's all a whim with
28   them.
29   they want fame.
30   they want it quickly
31   but they really have no urge
32   to do their work
33   except for fame
34   and to proclaim,
35   proclaim,
36   proclaim.

        Bukowski, Charles :  a tough time [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   "I was a student of philosophy,"
2   said the guy at the end of the bar.
3   "good," said a guy at the middle
4   of the bar.
5   "how'd you like to come down
6   here and lick my balls?"


7   it was a hot night and the
8   air conditioner had broken
9   down.


10   I wasn't feeling good myself.
11   some university mag had
12   returned 15 of my poems with
13   a scrawled note:
14   "we don't read in the
15   summer ..."


16   it was something about the
17   note, the handwriting, the
18   lazy effrontery of it.


19   and at the track, on my big
20   bet of the day
21   the horse had thrown the
22   jock coming out of the
23   gate.
24   also, my left front tire had
25   a slow leak
26   and my wife had
27   PMS
28   again.


29   "I don't think you have any
30   balls," said the guy at the
31   end of the bar to the guy
32   at the middle of the
33   bar.

[Page 117 ]




34   "oh yeah?" said the guy
35   accused of not having
36   any.


37   "yeah," said the accuser.


38   life was in a very stupid phase
39   for me.
40   I mean, I wasn't in a hospital,
41   I wasn't having a tooth
42   pulled,
43   my taxes were paid and
44   my shoelaces were
45   tied
46   but I felt rubbed
47   against by nasty
48   forces.
49   nothing beautiful,
50   unusual or even decent
51   had happened to me
52   for weeks.
53   my fault?
54   maybe.


55   "you can suck my ass,"
56   said the guy accused of
57   not having any balls.


58   "I can see you have an
59   ass," said the student of
60   philosophy, "because
61   I can see it sitting up
62   where your head
63   should be."


64   "listen, fellow," came the
65   response, "if you're looking
66   for a knuckle sandwich
67   you came to the right
68   guy."

[Page 118 ]




69   they are not reading in
70   the summer, I thought,
71   what are they doing,
72   lolling in a hammock
73   lofting farts into a
74   gentle breeze?
75   free drinks for Dylan
76   Thomas and a
77   scurrilous note for
78   me.


79   "you and whose army
80   is going to handle
81   me?"
82   said the guy at the
83   end of the bar.


84   "I'm the army!
85   me!"


86   "that right?
87   you better get the
88   navy too, man!"


89   you ever read the
90   poems in those
91   university mags?
92   tiny dribblings of
93   unreality,
94   boring probes
95   into the
96   nonsensical.


97   I finished my drink,
98   got up to walk
99   out.


100   "I studied under
101   Prof. Harris
102   at City College,"

[Page 119 ]


103   the guy at the end
104   of the bar
105   repeated.


106   "sure you did,"
107   said the guy at
108   the middle of the
109   bar,
110   "you were under
111   him,
112   face down,
113   on the springs!"


114   I stepped out into
115   the night just in time
116   to see a car hit a woman
117   crossing the street.
118   she flipped up
119   on the hood
120   on her back.
121   stayed there.
122   the guy jumped out of
123   the car and screamed,
124   "JESUS CHRIST!"


125   suddenly there were
126   125 people in the
127   street.


128   I turned and walked
129   away from it.
130   there was nothing I
131   could do.


132   when I got to my car
133   the left front tire was
134   flat.
135   I got in and sat
136   there.
137   the fog was rolling

[Page 120 ]


138   in.
139   I turned on the
140   ignition
141   and clicked the
142   radio on.
143   it had been a
144   crappy
145   summer.


[Page 121 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  some luck, somehow [from Bone Palace
        Ballet: New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I was already an old man
2   working there,
3   nearing 50,
4   had been there eleven
5   years
6   working the night shift,
7   this young guy came
8   along,
9   blond, swift, full of
10   energy.
11   he told me at a coffee
12   break one
13   night:
14   "I'm only going to be
15   here a year, I'm working
16   on my novel."


17   twenty years later
18   I heard he's still there,
19   and worse, that he's
20   given up
21   writing.


22   some of those jocks
23   deserve the dull
24   jobs
25   they hate.


26   so many of those
27   jobs are held
28   by
29   first time
30   novelists.
31   I was one of
32   them
33   but somehow I knew
34   that the gods were
35   watching

[Page 122 ]


36   so I never told
37   anybody.


38   and still
39   to this day
40   there are billions
41   of people
42   who don't know!

        Bukowski, Charles :  art class [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   of course, it wasn't my idea.
2   to me, Art is a fairly dirty word used by a large number
3   of people hiding behind walls of themselves;
4   I'm afraid I'm a shit and I prefer it that
5   way. that's all right
6   because I play my small game
7   and let alone what should be
8   let alone.


9   but the mother suggested our daughter
10   attend Saturday art class
11   and what's a drunk and a gambler and an unemployed man
12   to say? I pay a bit of child support, it's worth it,
13   she's a good little rag of a girl and we laugh a lot.
14   but the mother believes in Art,
15   she runs with a whole mad gang like that---
16   they chew on Art like vultures, suckerfish,
17   the blathering soul of Wilde, well, never mind,


18   don't let me get into that, o.k.?


19   the first one or 2 times were all right
20   I was just a strange man
21   standing there.


22   then later when the mothers saw
23   how my child ran to me with such delightful fury and
24   trust
25   I was almost accepted as if I
26   cared.


27   but as the weeks went on
28   the parents began to know each other,
29   speak to each other.


30   there was one perfectly terrible man,
31   a square something built of wood, he moved toward me
32   stiffly several times, smiling. I managed to walk off or lean over

[Page 124 ]


33   the wall as if sick. he finally gave up.
34   and then there was one worse than any other,
35   strangely diseased beard, eyes always happy, wore purple and
36   red and yellow, very interested in life, always thrusting himself on
37   everybody, a very fine fellow.
38   meanwhile I had broken my small toe, right foot,
39   while drunk and so when he moved toward me
40   it was with much difficulty
41   that I had to walk away down the steps as if I had forgotten
42   my ham sandwich
43   or my collected works of Keats.


44   soon the parents began to understand
45   and they stood in their circles talking
46   and I stood alone in my circle
47   not talking.


48   there was one young teacher, female,
49   in room 6 who looked like she needed a good
50   lay
51   and since I am a very old and evil-looking man
52   I stared at her ass tits lips ears everything
53   whenever she came out of room
54   6. she hated me and that gave me some amusement
55   while I waited for my
56   daughter.


57   the last Saturday was the worst.
58   I arrived
59   hung over.


60   then, at noon, from room 3,
61   Barnsdall Park, they ran out
62   and I thought, fine, I'll get the girl
63   and we'll play Batman and Robin
64   eat ice cream and forget the Art con.


65   but Jesus, they all ran toward me---
66   the teacher, a rather blushing type, male,
67   probably a nice person, though, and all that,

[Page 125 ]


68   but here they came
69   all running toward
70   /me/ .


71   16 little girls between 5 and 9
72   and 12 little boys between 5 and 9,
73   and the Art teacher blushing
74   running
75   and they have 2 or 3 large plastic balloons
76   scrawled with peace signs and colorful
77   designs, and I can't get out of the
78   way. my little girl is in there somewhere,
79   and I think, Jesus Christ, how phoney, how sickening.
80   how sickening the nice people are
81   and
82   it's all Art-shit, the trick,
83   everybody loads their trick on somebody else
84   and then they let their helium-filled balloons fly
85   into the sky
86   and my little girl said,
87   "Hank, Hank, come here and watch!"
88   so I went there and watched
89   and the Art teacher said,
90   "What's going to happen to them?
91   Tell me, what's going to happen to them?"
92   and he blushed
93   and he was thinking of the 2 or 3
94   helium-filled balloons
95   with their peace signs
96   and I was thinking about the 16 little girls
97   between 5 and 9
98   and 12 little boys between 5 and 9,
99   and I took my kid's hand
100   and I limped down the long stairway with her
101   (I had re-smashed the toe) and she said,
102   thinking about the balloons, "it's kind of sad."
103   and I said, "Yes, it is," then we found my blue 1962
104   Comet. we got in together, it started,
105   and we turned left and drove down Hollywood Boulevard
106   past a carwash. "Look," she said, "all those men in those

[Page 126 ]


107   orange overalls rubbing those cars with rags. why do
108   they do that?"


109   "that's so they can stay alive," I told
110   her.
111   "that's sad too," she said.


112   that's right, it was sad, it was their
113   Art, with very little blushing,
114   just work and wait and work and wait
115   as the sun is wasted
116   as they are wasted.


117   when we got to my place
118   she showed me her paintings and I said
119   "very nice, can I have this one?"


120   and she said, "sure."


121   I hung it on the wall.
122   it's looking at me now.
123   it's a girl's face done all in red
124   and the mouth is speaking. it says
125   "o.k.," then it says
126   "no."


127   /that's/ Art---Batman, Robin or
128   Plato couldn't have said it any
129   better.


[Page 127 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  payoff [from Bone Palace Ballet: New Poems
        (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I was to give a poetry reading
2   at a Venice coffeehouse
3   but we got there early
4   so I told the woman,
5   let's walk down by the sea
6   and I can drink a beer,
7   so we walked down through the sand
8   and there were some men there fishing
9   and I faced the ocean
10   and had a good drink
11   and then I said,
12   let's go back and walk along the boardwalk
13   and we walked east
14   and then I noticed a man standing alone
15   with his back to the sea.
16   and he lifted a horn,
17   played a quiet and brief melody, and
18   stopped.
19   then he simply stood there
20   with his back to the sea.
21   I had another drink
22   and we walked on.
23   then, on the way back,
24   he was still there
25   and he lifted the horn again
26   and played the same
27   quiet, sad melody, finished,
28   and holding the horn down at his side,
29   he stood there.


30   it was hot in the coffeehouse
31   and I threw my stuff at them
32   and got away with
33   it, climbed down
34   and then we were back in the car
35   driving toward my
36   place. "you read well," she said.
37   "yeah," I said, "thanks."

[Page 128 ]




38   but for me, the horn player had won the night,
39   and I felt the roll of bills in my pocket,
40   the payoff, and
41   I knew that night I had met a better man
42   and the better man had
43   won, and that was as it should
44   have been. but only the two of us
45   knew it.


[Page 129 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  ding-dong [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   he came over with a turban tied around his
2   head, and the long end of that turban
3   dangled down by his side
4   like a bell-cord.
5   it often got in his way
6   as he tried to light a cigarette
7   or lift his drink.


8   his girlfriend was dressed in a
9   fur outfit
10   that came down and covered her
11   feet.
12   her eyes were large and nice
13   and seemed always near
14   tears.
15   but she was
16   quiet.


17   he was'nt.


18   he jumped up often
19   spilling his drink on his
20   flowered shirt
21   he was six-feet-four and
22   worse than a bore.


23   it was at my place
24   and there were others
25   there.


26   I grabbed him by his belt and
27   pulled him to one side and
28   said, "what the fuck are you
29   /on/ ? I mean, buddy, you're
30   driving everybody /crazy/ ! do I
31   have to kick your /ass/ just to
32   get a modicum of
33   /silence/ ?"

[Page 130 ]




34   he just went on
35   talking.


36   I went back and sat down.
37   he followed and sat down
38   next to me.
39   he was a computer engineer.


40   he and the girl in the
41   fur outfit were going to
42   be married.
43   I knew I'd never go
44   to that wedding.


45   there was a fellow sitting on the floor
46   across from the coffee table
47   who told really
48   interesting and funny stories
49   but all any of us could hear was
50   the computer engineer.


51   after a while
52   we gave up and just
53   listened
54   although nobody could understand
55   much of what he was saying ....


56   the computer engineer and his
57   girl
58   were friends of the lady
59   I lived with
60   and since my lady
61   liked to say that
62   I treated her friends
63   badly
64   I just sat there and drank
65   as the tall one
66   leaped up and sat down again
67   talking
68   and getting tangled in his

[Page 131 ]


69   bell-cord.


70   I glanced over at the lady
71   I lived with.
72   she was smiling pleasantly
73   as he screamed his
74   nonsense.


75   and I thought, if I am being
76   tested I am failing again.
77   I can't find /anything/
78   interesting in any of
79   this


80   and I reached out and
81   yanked his
82   bell-cord....


83   still talking
84   his head
85   jerked
86   down
87   and he spilled his drink
88   on me


89   sat upright
90   and began again with
91   more vigor than
92   ever


93   only the head-jerk
94   seemed to clear his speech
95   patterns
96   and I finally began to understand what
97   he was saying.


98   he was telling the world
99   that
100   I was an
101   antisocial hunk of

[Page 132 ]


102   despicable shit. that
103   brotherhood and sisterhood
104   would engulf my work and my
105   petty ways. that

108   I poured him a new

110   he picked it up and
111   snouted it

        Bukowski, Charles :  AFDC for you and me [from Bone Palace
        Ballet: New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   these dogs, she said, are always sticking their
2   noses in my crotch, it's exasperating
3   I don't know what they
4   want.
5   she had on dark pink pantyhose
6   and had hands 50 years old and a face 40
7   but she was in her late
8   20s, early 30s,
9   one psychiatrist after another,
10   she was on
11   AFDC, just like the rest of us wanted to be.
12   we discussed how we had bad feelings when we
13   killed certain types of bugs,
14   but we decided it was all right to kill
15   spiders and cockroaches
16   and it was all right to eat fish and crabs
17   and lobsters,
18   also chickens didn't have any damned brains
19   but pigs were smarter than horses,
20   you couldn't eat pigs.
21   I'm a cocktail waitress, she said,
22   and I wear this mini-skirt but I sure get tired
23   of those men staring at my
24   crotch. I get so drunk
25   that I spill drinks on people,
26   and later on I sing,
27   not rock, that's dead,
28   I sing jazz ...
29   will you marry me? I asked.
30   yes, she said.


31   then she and her boyfriend got into a kind of
32   argument and they left me there with the wine bottle and
33   I sat eating fried chicken
34   and listening to Shostakovich
35   until 5 a.m.
36   in the morning.

        Bukowski, Charles :  I know you [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   you with long hair, legs crossed high, sitting at the end of
2   the bar, you like a butcher knife against my throat
3   as the nightingale sings elsewhere while laughter
4   mingles with the roach's hiss.
5   I know you as
6   the piano player in the restaurant who plays badly,
7   his mouth a tiny cesspool and his eyes little wet rolls of
8   toilet paper.
9   you rode behind me on my bicycle as I pumped toward Venice as
10   a boy, I knew you were there, even in that brisk wind I smelled
11   your
12   breath.
13   I knew you in the love bed as you whispered lies of passion while
14   your
15   nails dug me into you.
16   I saw you adored by crowds in Spain while pigtail boys with
17   swords
18   colored the sun for your glory.
19   I saw you complete the circle of friend, enemy, celebrity and
20   stranger as the fox ran through the sun carrying its heart in its
21   mouth.
22   those madmen I fought in the back alleys of bars were
23   you.
24   you, yes, heard Plato's last words.
25   not too many mornings ago I found my old cat in the yard,
26   dry tongue stuck out awry as if it had never belonged, eyes tangled,
27   eyelids soft yet, I lifted her, daylight shining upon my
28   fingers and her fur, my ignorant existence roaring against the
29   hedges and the flowers.
30   I know you, you wait while the fountains gush and the scales
31   weigh,
32   you tiresome daughter-of-a-bitch, come on in, the door is
33   open.

1   as many interpretations of

3   as fleas upon my favorite cat,
4   or as many garbagemen of verse
5   in a world full of flamingos.


6   this
7   tired
8   life
9   this dusty dream,
10   these April nights,
11   this thunder in a paper cup,
12   all the old ladies
13   alone in rooms
14   working crossword puzzles,
15   the dead dogs of forever
16   crushed with
17   lolling tongues,
18   the parched innards of
19   mountains
20   aching to
21   scream,
22   what is this grueling
23   nonsense?


24   is it
25   the worm crawling toward
26   no paradise?
27   the scissors in a closed

29   young girls giggling and
30   lost in their flesh?

39   and what about
40   the dark streets of Dublin?
41   the last page of the book?
42   the green park bench alone?
43   the last necktie?
44   the last footstep
45   behind you?


46   this incomplete sob of darkness.
47   a wingless bird waiting.
48   a druid in the wasted light.
49   a drunk in the gutter.
50   the singing of fools

5   there is always somebody to kill the

7   to unplug the toilet,
8   there is always somebody to bury

10   there are always animals with
11   beautiful eyes,

13   like Stanley leaning toward me
14   and saying in a soft voice,
15   "do you know that at the end of
16   his career Saroyan had other
17   people writing his stuff and that he
18   gave them twenty-five
19   percent?"
20   this was supposed to make me
21   feel original,
22   feel good because I was a starving
23   writer and the rejects were arriving
24   in record numbers.
25   it didn't make me feel
26   good.


27   there is always somebody or something
28   to make
29   you feel worse.

1   ---he's a dandy
2   ---small moustache
3   ---usually sucking on a cigar


4   he tends to lean into cars as he
5   transacts business


6   first time I met him, he said,
7   "hey! ya gonna make a
8   killin'?"


9   "maybe," I answered.


10   next meeting it was:
11   "hey, Ramrod! what's
12   happening?"


13   "very little," I told
14   him.


15   next time I had my girlfriend with me
16   and he just
17   grinned.


18   next time I was
19   alone.


20   "hey," he asked, "where's the young
21   chick?"


22   "I left her at home...."


23   " /Bullshit/ ! I'll bet she dumped
24   you!"


25   and the next time
26   he really leaned into the car:

27   "what's a guy like /you/ doing driving a
28   BMW? I'll bet you inherited your
29   money, you didn't get this car with your
30   brains!"


31   "how'd you guess?" I
32   answered.


33   that was some weeks ago.

1   you stop agonizing for a while
2   thinking that maybe life's true
3   essence has risen to the
4   top (temporarily)
5   or that a minor decency,
6   a minor sensibility
7   has taken a gentle
8   hold.
9   but it's illusion, all
10   illusion:
11   the crap is still crap,
12   the old structure remains
13   firmly
14   in place,
15   you're going to have to
16   endure
17   the same hollow ghosts
18   of love,
19   the same cardboard
20   faces,
21   the same eyeless
22   eyes,
23   the old dark,
24   the same old dark,
25   the same knock
26   on the door
27   with nobody on the
28   other
29   side.
30   we are not without
31   joy,
32   we have what we
33   need here,
34   and my wish is simple
35   enough,
36   although it may
37   not be granted:
38   that the living dead

[Page 143 ]


39   of this life
40   will not soon
41   die
42   and then follow,
43   after the graciousness
44   of death
45   hopefully rescues me
46   from the monstrous
47   weight of
48   this drizzling
49   suckerfish
50   nightmare.

1   as we stand there before the purple mountains
2   in our stupid clothing, we pause, look
3   about: nothing changes, it only congeals,
4   our lives crawl slowly, our companions depreciate
5   us.
6   then
7   we awaken a moment---
8   the animals are entering the track!
9   /Quick's Sister, Perfect Raj, Vive Le Torch/ ,
10   /Miss Leuschner, Keepin' Peace, True To Be/ ,
11   /Lou's Good Morning/ .


12   now, it's good for us: the lightning flash
13   of hope, the laughter of the hidden gods.
14   we were never meant to be what we are or where
15   we are, we are looking for an escape, some music
16   from the sun, the girl we never found.
17   we are betting on the miracle again
18   there before the purple mountains
19   as the horses parade past
20   so much more beautiful than
21   our lives.

1   you have to lay down like an animal
2   until it
3   charges, you
4   have to lay down
5   in the center of the action


6   lay down and wait until it charges then you
7   must get
8   up
9   face it get
10   it before it gets
11   you


12   the whole process is more
13   shy than
14   vulnerable so


15   lay down and wait sometimes it's
16   ten minutes sometimes it's years sometimes it
17   never arrives but you can't rush it push
18   it
19   there's no way to cheat or get a
20   jump on it you have to


21   lay down
22   lay down and wait like
23   an animal.

1   I sat in that cheap hotel room
2   waiting.
3   I sat drinking wine and
4   waiting.
5   I turned out the lights and
6   drank in the
7   dark.


8   the phone rang.
9   it was her.
10   "I'll be along in a little
11   while, Hank."
12   "when?"
13   "just a little while, wait
14   for me, don't
15   worry."


16   she hung up.
17   she was one of my first
18   women.
19   ten years older than
20   I.
21   the hotel was on 6th
22   street.


23   I sat in the dark
24   drinking the
25   wine.
26   soon the bottle was
27   empty.


28   I went out,
29   took the elevator down,
30   to get
31   another.


32   when I got back
33   I asked the desk clerk

[Page 147 ]


34   if there had been any
35   messages.
36   he looked at me as if
37   I were crazy.


38   I took the elevator back
39   up.


40   I was about halfway
41   through the second
42   bottle when the phone
43   rang.
44   "Hank, it's me, I'll be
45   there real
46   soon."
47   she hung
48   up.


49   I sat in the dark and
50   finished the
51   bottle.
52   then I got out of
53   there and took the
54   elevator
55   down.


56   I walked half a
57   block
58   took a left
59   walked down to the
60   bar.


61   through the blinds
62   I could see her
63   sitting at the
64   bar.
65   she was smoking
66   drinking
67   talking to some
68   old guy in a

[Page 148 ]


69   wrinkled grey
70   suit.


71   I walked down
72   to my car,
73   got in
74   and drove out
75   of there.


76   saw her somewhere a
77   couple of weeks
78   later and
79   she said,
80   "geez, Hank, what
81   happened?
82   I went up to that
83   room and there was
84   nobody
85   there!"


86   "no kidding?" I said,
87   "you mean you went there
88   and there was nobody
89   there?"


90   she knew it was
91   over.


92   she opened her purse
93   and looked down
94   into it,
95   fumbling
96   around.


97   looking for cigarettes,
98   a lighter
99   or her next
100   move.

1   I will not name this poet although his blood-red and dark
2   words impressed themselves upon me and still
3   do.
4   in mid-life he became and remained a complete
5   recluse.
6   he spoke to no one and was seen by very few.
7   his work and his life appeared to be as one.


8   it was not until after his death that I read his
9   Collected Letters and these
10   pandered to university powers and publishing
11   forces.
12   there was letter after letter of
13   beckoning and
14   posturing, of
15   obeisance and
16   compromise.


17   he hardly seemed the same man.
18   maybe he wasn't, I thought, maybe somebody else wrote those
19   letters for him
20   and then
21   they were published.


22   in reality, though, I knew that he had written
23   them.


24   how soon our idols fall
25   until
26   there are none
27   left.

1   it will never end, there will be no
2   help, no mercy, no living thing,
3   it will all go on, uselessly, through
4   fabrication and old habits, it
5   will continue, a headless body
6   of life, walking old walks, doing
7   old tricks, dreaming old dreams,
8   it will be as alone as a mountain,
9   and despite billions of beings
10   there will not be one real being, there
11   will be everlasting waste and only
12   the animals will be real, they will have
13   the pureness of eye and the grace,
14   they will be the last, the simple,
15   pure, the ember, what it meant
16   truly, the wolf will have the heart
17   and the panther the lungs and
18   the eagle, the eyes, and the last
19   war will be one man sitting in a
20   chair, laughing at it
21   all.

1   came to town in the middle of the night
2   found a motel room
3   lit a cigarette
4   and looked at the black and white
5   tv,
6   a couple in the next room
7   arguing,
8   they sound drunk,
9   Southern,
10   I turn the tv off,
11   look through the blinds,
12   my car is still there,
13   I take my shoes and clothes off,
14   too tired to shower,
15   I manage to brush my teeth,
16   come back,
17   switch out the lights,
18   stretch out in the bed in the
19   dark,
20   I can hear them still
21   arguing,
22   it isn't a very interesting
23   argument,
24   I'm tired,
25   want to sleep
26   and soon they stop arguing
27   and I listen to the traffic
28   going by
29   but I can't sleep,
30   somehow I think of myself as
31   a dead man
32   on that bed,
33   I'm dead, the maid will
34   find me when she comes
35   to change the sheets and
36   towels.
37   upon seeing me
38   she will make a small

[Page 152 ]


39   frightened sound,
40   close the door
41   and run off
42   somewhere.


43   that scene seems appealing
44   to me,
45   quite,
46   I yawn, stretch, turn on my
47   right side,
48   see the red
49   NO VACANCY sign through
50   the blinds
51   and just like that I
52   am
53   asleep.

1   how strange it is on
2   a hot summer
3   night
4   to come back in
5   and go over your figures
6   trying to piece together the action
7   at the track,
8   sitting in your undershirt,
9   sucking on a cold beer,
10   going over it all once again,
11   getting ready for next time,
12   that magic time
13   when everything you bet on
14   comes in,
15   just to put life straight,
16   just to show who's in control,
17   going over the consensus,
18   speed, pace, consistency,
19   money earned,
20   it's all there,
21   just around the corner,
22   the eternal secret.
23   better hurry,
24   the time is short,
25   you've seen 70,000 races,
26   many of the jocks you knew
27   are now dead,
28   better hurry, Chinaski,
29   don't drop the whip,
30   go for the opening,
31   the wire is rushing up
32   at you
33   sitting in your room
34   in your undershirt
35   on a hot summer night,
36   cigarette dangling,
37   it has to be madness,
38   it was always

[Page 156 ]


39   madness,
40   this endless search for the

42   truth that
43   still can't be

1   he buys 5 cars a month, details them, waxes and buffs
2   them out, then
3   resells them at a profit of one or two grand.


4   he has a nice Jewish wife and he tells me that he
5   bangs her until the walls shake.


6   he wears a red cap, squints in the light, has a regular
7   job besides the car gig.


8   I have no idea of what he is trying to accomplish and maybe he
9   doesn't either.


10   he's a nicer fellow than most, always good to see him,
11   we laugh, say a few bright lines.


12   but
13   each time
14   after I see him
15   I get the blues for him, for me, for all of us:


16   for want of something to do


17   we keep slaying our small dragons


18   as the big one waits.

        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   the waving of hands, the posturing of the
2   limbs in putrid whiteness,
3   the mouth without words, the eyes without
4   light---
5   such a farce, never a farce such as this!
6   boulevards of human waste on parade!
7   look at them!
8   look!
9   god, I'm going to puke out my battered damned
10   heart at the sight of them!
11   these awful disgusting creatures posing as
12   this or that---
13   a king, a bathing beauty, a dancer,
14   a clown, a mouse ...
15   Christ, stop it!
16   the walls are falling!
17   this darkness shakes me like a dirty rag!
18   human waste on parade throughout the
19   centuries!
20   why am I the last one alive?
21   there's no answer to
22   that.

        Bukowski, Charles :  bum on the loose [from Bone Palace Ballet:
        New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I climbed off a park bench to engage the giants of
2   literature in battle.
3   I lived with women madder than the gods
4   themselves.
5   I consumed enough booze to get an army drunk.
6   I lived in shacks without windows, without electricity,
7   without plumbing, without heat.
8   I climbed off the park bench to engage the giants of
9   literature in battle.
10   I was beaten in alleys, robbed.
11   I searched the cities for sanity.
12   I read great books and they made me sleepy.
13   I starved in rooms fat with rats.
14   my parents were in shame of me.
15   the beautiful ladies thought me ugly.
16   I climbed off the park bench to engage the giants of
17   literature in battle.
18   the world considered me insane.
19   I slept in deserted graveyards.
20   I sat in bars through the mornings and into the night
21   and back into morning.
22   I engaged the giants of literature.
23   all my work came back.
24   one editor wrote, "what is this stuff?"
25   I worked the factories, the warehouses.
26   I got married and divorced.
27   I was 40 years old when my first thin pamphlet of poems was
28   published.
29   it wasn't that good.
30   at the age of 50 I decided to become a professional writer.
31   I earned $980 the first year.
32   I lived on a candy bar a day.
33   I was engaging the giants of literature.
34   the ladies descended like locusts.
35   I threw people off my front porch.
36   I was engaging the giants.
37   the giants were not aware of this.
38   only I was aware.

[Page 160 ]




39   I climbed off the park bench to engage the giants of
40   literature.


41   I didn't think that they were all that good.


42   tell me, do you?

        Bukowski, Charles :  going away [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   down through the last door,
2   past the music,
3   past the dancing girls,
4   down through the last hall
5   past the last New Year
6   and the last hurrah!
7   past the flight of the
8   hummingbird,
9   past the last kiss,
10   the last flux and flow,
11   the last new day,
12   die last night's sleep,
13   the last sweet orange,
14   the last war,
15   past the last
16   last
17   word.

        Bukowski, Charles :  stag [from Bone Palace Ballet: New Poems
        (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   this guy pretended to be a French painter
2   and I sat on a couch with a beer
3   then 2 girls walked in
4   while he
5   the painter
6   was asleep in a chair
7   drunk


8   one of the girls
9   took his cock out and stroked it


10   while the other one
11   painted it
12   (on canvas, that is)


13   and then he awakened and the girls began to
14   strip down


15   and the painter had the 2 girls and this one
16   cock, and he did it all
17   while they did it
18   all


19   and sometimes it was difficult to
20   separate the 3 bodies
21   and I sat there while the camera focused
22   and I thought, hell, we're all
23   crazy,


24   and when it was all over
25   everybody got dressed and I was
26   introduced to the
27   actors. (actresses too, pardon me,
28   girls.)


29   the guy with the cock was trying to log enough hours
30   to be a commercial airline
31   pilot.

[Page 163 ]




32   one of the girls---the /young/ looking one---
33   had a girl in college


34   the other one wanted to go to the Orient and
35   study something or
36   other.


37   the cameraman
38   poured the whiskey around
39   and we sat there laughing and enjoying
40   each other.


41   they made their living with stag films
42   and it was a little studio room
43   #228
44   someplace in Hollywood


45   but I got the feeling that if I pulled out my cock
46   everybody would be
47   insulted, even
48   I


49   so I had a few more drinks
50   got a phone
51   # from one of the girls for
52   later


53   and drove on
54   home.

        Bukowski, Charles :  late payment [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   a rifle bullet across the page and into Shakespeare's
2   grave,
3   the steam iron pressed against the inner
4   arm,
5   the headless scream,
6   the unfolding dahlia,
7   notes from a dirty diary,
8   the lion's nightmare at 2:30 p.m.,
9   this summer has run through the trees like a tank,
10   I jam my heart into a rubber glove and the fingers JUMP,
11   the Russian Empire gurgles down the garbage drain,
12   we approach the 21st Century with our dirty stinking laundry,
13   the gods are done with me and them and this,
14   the last useless word looking for a place to die.

        Bukowski, Charles :  2 horse collars [from Bone Palace Ballet:
        New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I'm hot now, he said,
2   and lined a single to
3   center.
4   next up he tripled,
5   then drew a walk,
6   4th at bat
7   he homered.
8   5th at bat
9   he doubled.


10   I'm hot now, he said,
11   then sang in the
12   shower.
13   when he got to his
14   place
15   his woman wasn't
16   there.


17   he went to the dresser drawer
18   got what he needed
19   went over to Mike's and
20   broke the door down.
21   they were in bed
22   together.
23   at the last moment
24   he got the real truth of it,
25   changed his mind
26   put the gun into his mouth
27   and pulled the
28   trigger.


29   the next day they had the rookie
30   up from Memphis in his
31   spot. the kid went 0 for 4,
32   suckered on the change-up
33   and the low and inside fast ball.
34   but he was good with the women
35   and that's more important than
36   .364

        Bukowski, Charles :  counsel [from Bone Palace Ballet: New Poems
        (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I am living in hell, he told me, and I said, is that right,
2   Frankie? and he said, I am truly living in hell, you
3   would never believe it.
4   everything, he continued, has hardened into a repetitious
5   march to nowhere.
6   is that right, Frankie? fucking-a, he said, you ever
7   been locked into a situation where the only escape is
8   death?
9   yes, I told him.
10   then what do you do? he asked.
11   Frankie, I just wait, death is coming anyhow.
12   but, he told me, I can't wait.
13   Frankie, you'll wait.
14   why, he asked me, is pain the most present and constant
15   thing in life?
16   physical pain is hard to explain, Frankie, but I know what
17   causes most spiritual pain.
18   yeah? yeah? he asked.
19   most spiritual pain, my lad, is caused by
20   too much expectation.
21   yeah? yeah? he asked.
22   too much expectation, I said, try to avoid it.
23   do you? he asked.
24   yes, more and more I expect less and less.
25   and do you get less?
26   almost always, Frankie.
27   damn, he said, it always helps to talk to you, you've been
28   around the block.
29   I'm afraid so, Frankie.
30   he asked, did you ever think you would live this long?
31   Frankie, I haven't lived this long, I've lasted this
32   long, good
33   night.


34   I hung up the receiver and pulled the
35   bottle
36   toward me.

        Bukowski, Charles :  my worst rejection slip [from Bone Palace
        Ballet: New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   came to me when I was living in
2   that court on DeLongpre.
3   it was from the editor of one
4   of the sex mags on
5   Melrose Avenue.


6   "listen, Bukowski, you are a
7   good writer but /never/
8   send us a story like that
9   /again!/
10   no man beds down with
11   that many women
12   in a day or in a night
13   and a day,
14   especially an ugly old
15   fart like you!
16   we've been delighted
17   with your previous
18   fiction
19   but
20   /please, please/ ,
21   /please/ ,
22   don't lay the bullshit
23   on too thick,
24   the reader will
25   /never believe/
26   /it/
27   and we here
28   are insulted to
29   the /god-damned/
30   /hilt/ with your
31   exaggerations!"


32   well, I reread the
33   story and found it
34   perfectly accurate
35   in the factual
36   sense.

[Page 169 ]




37   I dropped it on the
38   floor and went in
39   and poured a
40   drink.
41   as I walked out
42   there was a
43   knock on the
44   door.


45   it was a young lady.
46   she stood there
47   looking
48   wild.


49   "what are you
50   doing?"


51   "nothing."


52   "well, I'm taking
53   Nina to visit her father
54   and then I'm
55   coming right
56   back!"


57   "oh good, baby ..."


58   then she turned
59   and ran to
60   her
61   car,
62   I heard it roar
63   off down the
64   street.


65   I slammed the
66   drink down and
67   then the
68   phone rang.

[Page 170 ]




69   "hello," I
70   said.


71   it was a female
72   voice.


73   "what are you
74   doing?"


75   "nothing."


76   "are you drinking?"


77   "yes."


78   "is there a woman
79   there with you?"


80   "no."


81   "we were to have
82   dinner together
83   and you were
84   going to spend the
85   night.
86   do you
87   remember?"


88   "sure, baby,
89   I'll be there at
90   seven."


91   she hung
92   up.


93   I sat down with
94   my drink.
95   I finished it.
96   then I got up
97   and got another,

[Page 171 ]


98   sat there.


99   there was a knock
100   on my door.
101   it was my landlady.
102   she was already
103   red-faced with
104   booze.


105   "o.k.," she said,
106   "I've got twelve
107   quarts of
108   Eastside in
109   the refrigerator.
110   you comin'
111   down?"


112   "later ..."


113   "you better come
114   down, you horny old son-of-
115   a-bitch!"


116   "oh, I will ..."


117   then she was
118   gone.
119   and I looked down
120   at the rejected
121   story
122   on the floor.


123   too bad,
124   the way people
125   thought:
126   that only handsome
127   young men
128   got all the
129   action.
130   and I didn't even

[Page 172 ]


131   want the
132   action.
133   it was getting between
134   me
135   and my
136   typewriter.


137   it's true that there
138   were days
139   when nobody
140   bothered me.
141   then I sometimes
142   masturbated.


143   those were the days
144   when I got my
145   work done.


146   I picked the story up
147   and slipped it back
148   into the
149   envelope for the
150   time
151   being.


152   later on
153   I'd mail it off to
154   somebody with
155   more common
156   sense.

        Bukowski, Charles :  40,000 [from Bone Palace Ballet: New Poems
        (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   now
2   at the track today,
3   Saturday,
4   Father's Day,
5   each paid admission is
6   entitled to a free wallet
7   and each wallet contains a
8   little surprise.


9   most of the men are
10   between 30 and 55,
11   going to fat,
12   many of them in walking
13   shorts.
14   they have gone stale in mid-
15   life,
16   flattened out.


17   men like
18   these don't even
19   deserve death,
20   these little walking
21   whales,
22   only there are so
23   many of
24   them,
25   in the urinal,
26   in the food lines,
27   the species has managed to
28   survive
29   in a most limited
30   sense
31   and when you see
32   so many of them
33   like that,
34   up close,
35   there but not there,
36   breathing, farting,

[Page 174 ]


37   commenting,
38   waiting for the thunder
39   that will not be heard,
40   waiting for the charging
41   white horse of
42   Glory,
43   waiting for the lovely
44   female who will not
45   arrive,
46   waiting to WIN,
47   waiting for the great
48   dream to
49   engulf them
50   you can only wonder.


51   they clomp in their
52   sandals,
53   gulp at hot dogs
54   animal style,
55   gulping the
56   meat.
57   they complain about
58   losing,
59   blame the jocks,
60   drink green
61   beer.
62   the parking lot is
63   jammed with their
64   mortgaged
65   cars.


66   the jocks mount once
67   again for another
68   race,
69   the men press
70   toward the betting
71   windows
72   mesmerized,
73   fathers and non-fathers,
74   Monday is waiting

[Page 175 ]


75   for them,
76   and this is the last
77   big lark.


78   but at the same time
79   in that same place
80   the horses are
81   totally
82   beautiful.
83   it is shocking how
84   beautiful they
85   are
86   at that time,
87   in that place,
88   their life shines
89   through them:
90   miracles happen,
91   even in
92   hell.


93   I decide to stay for
94   one more
95   race.

        Bukowski, Charles :  coffeeshop [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   she has served me and I am
2   eating,
3   "is everything all right?"
4   she asks.
5   "yes, thank you ..."
6   "more coffee?"
7   "all right ..."


8   I am reading the paper
9   and eating.
10   "cream?" she asks.
11   "no, thanks ..."


12   she pours the
13   coffee.


14   5 minutes pass.
15   she is back
16   "is everything all right?"
17   "yes."
18   "more coffee?"
19   "no."
20   "are you going to try
21   one of our desserts?"
22   "no, thank you ..."
23   "come on, you only
24   live once!"
25   "yes, I know ..."


26   she leaves again.
27   but not for long.


28   "you care for more
29   rolls?"
30   "no, thank you ..."
31   "did you like the
32   turkey?"
33   "yes."

[Page 177 ]


34   "you ought to try
35   our roast beef."
36   "you mean,
37   now?"
38   "no, next time."


39   she just stands there.
40   "I saw you in here the
41   other day with your
42   daughter."
43   "that was my wife."
44   "oh, you're married ..."
45   "yes."
46   "more coffee?"
47   "all right."
48   "you take cream?"
49   "no cream."


50   she comes back and
51   pours the
52   coffee.
53   then leaves.


54   I try it.
55   it's unbearably
56   strong.
57   they don't clean the
58   coffee maker.


59   it's time to leave,
60   I need the bill.
61   I look for the waitress.
62   I don't see her
63   anywhere.
64   I read the paper:
65   mass murderer boils
66   the heads for
67   soup.


68   the bus boy comes

[Page 178 ]


69   by,
70   picks up my
71   plate,
72   leaves the bad
73   coffee.


74   then he comes back
75   carrying the coffee
76   container.


77   "more coffee?"


78   "no, thanks, have you seen
79   the waitress?"


80   "no."


81   "where is she?"


82   "I don't know."


83   he walks off.


84   I sit waiting.
85   nobody appears.


86   I get up from the
87   table to go look for
88   the waitress.
89   I find her just outside
90   the kitchen,
91   she's smoking a
92   cigarette and talking
93   to the cook.


94   "waitress," I ask,
95   "can I have the
96   check?"


97   "oh yes," she

[Page 179 ]


98   smiles.


99   I go back and sit
100   down.
101   she arrives with the
102   check.
103   she's signed her
104   name at the
105   bottom,
106   "thanks!
107   Carolyn."
108   she has drawn a
109   little smiling
110   face.
111   she puts the check down
112   on top of a wet
113   spot.


114   "more coffee?"


115   "no, thanks."


116   "was everything all
117   right?"


118   "yes."


119   she walks off.
120   I leave a tip, go to
121   the register,
122   pay the bill.
123   the owner is
124   behind the
125   register.
126   she takes my
127   money, hands me
128   the change
129   without looking at
130   me.
131   she is an older

[Page 180 ]


132   woman,
133   a bit on the
134   heavy
135   side.
136   still looking at
137   something else in front
138   of her
139   she asks,
140   "was everything
141   all right?"
142   "yes," I answer
143   and I go out the
144   door and into the
145   street and into the
146   world,
147   never to return
148   there again,
149   not in this life
150   or any life.
151   I find my car,
152   get in, drive away
153   thinking, now if
154   that wasn't hell
155   then hell isn't going to
156   be
157   so bad.

        Bukowski, Charles :  poetry readings [from Bone Palace Ballet:
        New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   poetry readings have to be some of the saddest
2   damned things ever,
3   the gathering of the clansmen and clanladies,
4   week after week, month after month, year
5   after year,
6   getting old together,
7   reading on to tiny gatherings,
8   still hoping their genius will be
9   discovered,
10   making tapes together, discs together,
11   sweating for applause
12   they read basically to and for
13   each other,
14   they can't find a New York publisher
15   or one
16   within miles,
17   but they read on and on
18   in the poetry holes of America,
19   never daunted,
20   never considering the possibility that
21   their talent might be
22   thin, almost invisible,
23   they read on and on
24   before their mothers, their sisters, their husbands,
25   their wives, their friends, the other poets
26   and the handful of idiots who have wandered
27   in
28   from nowhere.


29   I am ashamed for them,
30   I am ashamed that they have to bolster each other,
31   I am ashamed for their lisping egos,
32   their lack of guts.


33   if these are our creators,
34   please, please give me something else:


35   a drunken plumber at a bowling alley,

[Page 182 ]


36   a prelim boy in a four rounder,
37   a jock guiding his horse through along the
38   rail,
39   a bartender on last call,
40   a waitress pouring me a coffee,
41   a drunk sleeping in a deserted doorway,
42   a dog munching a dry bone,
43   an elephant's fart in a circus tent,
44   a 6 p.m. freeway crush,
45   the mailman telling a dirty joke


46   anything
47   anything
48   but
49   these.

        Bukowski, Charles :  journey to the end [from Bone Palace
        Ballet: New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   there is this fellow in the Netherlands who sends
2   me photos of Celine and boxes of marvelous
3   cigars.
4   well, I am a dog: I enjoy both.
5   the cigars go well with my red wine and I never tire of
6   Celine or his photos---a very good face on that fellow
7   Louis Ferdinand Destouches.
8   (we have some famous modern writers whose faces look like
9   the inside of bedpans and they write the same way.)


10   I like my nights with Celine's photos,
11   classical music, cigars, red wine and the
12   computer.


13   Celine watches over me as I drink, type, listen to music
14   and smoke the cigars; we have a great time together as
15   other people are bowling, sleeping, watching tv, arguing,
16   screwing, eating, doing all those
17   dumb things and others.


18   and now here
19   the words fly like crazy sparrows in a storm, Shostakovich
20   bellows from the radio, as the cigar smoke whirls to the left and
21   out
22   the door and into a night as dark as red wine.


23   hello Celine ... Celine ... you dog ... we endure the pain
24   of centuries ... but we can laugh ... sometimes. here
25   among your photos the
26   dark luck is good.

        Bukowski, Charles :  upon reading a critical review [from Bone
        Palace Ballet: New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   it's difficult to accept
2   and you look around the room
3   for the person they are talking
4   about.


5   he's not there.
6   he's not here.
7   he's gone.


8   by the time they get to your books you
9   are no longer in your
10   books.
11   you are on the next page,
12   in your next
13   book.


14   and worse,
15   they don't even get the old books right.
16   you are given credit you don't
17   deserve, for insights that aren't
18   there.


19   people read /themselves/ into books, altering
20   what they need and discarding what they
21   don't.


22   good critics are as rare as good
23   writers.
24   and whether I get a good review or a
25   bad one
26   I can take neither
27   seriously.


28   I am on the next page.
29   in the next book.

1   we are gathered here now
2   to bury her in this
3   poem.


4   she did not marry an unemployed wino who
5   beat her every
6   night.


7   her several children will never wear
8   snot-stained shirts
9   or torn dresses.


10   the beautiful lady
11   simply
12   calmly
13   died.


14   and may the clean dirt of this poem
15   bury
16   her.


17   her and her womb
18   and her jewels
19   and her combs and her
20   poems


21   and her pale blue eyes
22   and her
23   grinning
24   rich
25   frightened
26   husband.

        Bukowski, Charles :  black [from Bone Palace Ballet: New Poems

1   there are nights so bad
2   that the fingers on the
3   keys are
4   useless
5   and you might as well
6   cover the
7   machine,
8   might as well
9   sit in a chair,
10   go to
11   bed,
12   wait on life,
13   wait on death,
14   wait on change.


15   literature is
16   just no damned
17   good
18   now,
19   yours or
20   anybody
21   else's.

        Bukowski, Charles :  my style [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I watch the jocks come out in the post parade
2   and one will win the race, the others will lose
3   but each jock must win sometime in some race
4   on some day, and he must do it often enough
5   or he is no longer a jockey.


6   it's like each of us sitting over a typewriter
7   tonight or tomorrow or next week or next month.
8   it's like the girls on the street trying to score
9   for their pimps
10   and they have to do it often enough
11   or they are no longer whores
12   and we have to do it often enough
13   or we're whores who can't score.


14   I would like a little more kindness and warmth
15   in the structure of things.


16   I became a writer but when I was a boy
17   I used to dream of becoming the village idiot,
18   I used to lie in bed and imagine myself that careless idiot,
19   planning ways to get food and sympathy easily,
20   a planned confusion of not too much love or
21   effort.


22   some would claim that I have succeeded
23   in this.

        Bukowski, Charles :  dead [from Bone Palace Ballet: New Poems
        (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   he wrote a joyous and mad
2   novel about unbelievable and
3   romantic episodes
4   and his words danced with
5   laughter and mockery and
6   gamble.


7   the novel made him
8   famous and he went on
9   to write others but none
10   like the first.


11   then he stopped
12   writing, came here from
13   his native land
14   and became a professor
15   at a southern
16   university.


17   he wears his suit, his
18   tie, his dignity
19   as tokens of
20   respectability
21   as his students wait
22   for him to go wild,
23   to break down the
24   walls,
25   to smash glass,
26   precedence,
27   minds.


28   but the semesters
29   pass, quiet
30   seasons.

1   he told me he
2   had 6 kids
3   had been
4   married
5   5 times and that next
6   Wednesday
7   he would be
8   38 years
9   old.


10   I had always thought of him
11   as
12   one of the sharpest
13   valets at
14   racetrack
15   parking


16   but then
17   I've always been better at
18   picking horses
19   than at
20   picking
21   people.

1   William Saroyan
2   married the same
3   woman
4   twice


5   which means
6   he must have
7   forgotten
8   something
9   about the
10   first
11   time
12   around.


13   anyhow, he claimed
14   it ruined his
15   life.


16   but,
17   actually,
18   there are
19   many things
20   which can
21   ruin
22   a man's
23   life


24   just
25   depending upon

27   gets to him

        Bukowski, Charles :  our world [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   it's strange, isn't it?
2   you can't
3   compare it to
4   anything
5   else
6   yet you quickly
7   learn
8   that there is
9   something wrong
10   with it
11   and with the people
12   that
13   inhabit it.


14   you want to
15   be objective
16   and fair
17   but when you
18   see what it
19   does to us
20   and the choices
21   it leaves
22   us---
23   the streets you must
24   walk,
25   what you hear
26   and see,
27   endure
28   day by day
29   year by year,
30   night and
31   day---
32   god damn it,
33   you have nothing to
34   compare /that/ with
35   either
36   so you really
37   can't call it
38   awful

[Page 194 ]


39   but why does
40   it seem
41   to be?


42   for example
43   putting
44   your shoes on
45   in the morning
46   is like having
47   to walk
48   through
49   mountains.


50   yes,
51   it must be
52   us.
53   we must be
54   sick.
55   that must
56   be
57   it
58   although we have
59   nothing to
60   compare us
61   with
62   either.


63   sick.
64   unperceptive.
65   born into this wondrous
66   light and
67   glory
68   and then gagging
69   on it,
70   puking it
71   away
72   as the bees
73   and the butterflies
74   transport
75   ever more,
76   their bloody
77   pollen.

        Bukowski, Charles :  how to get rid of the purists [from Bone
        Palace Ballet: New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   several months ago I was sent some tapes
2   by a musician who had put several of
3   my poems to music.
4   he professed much interest in my
5   poesy.
6   I played the tapes on the way to the track
7   and back.
8   very classical (and I am a classical music
9   freak)
10   but the overall tone of the work was
11   I felt
12   tinged with intellectual
13   elitism---the pretentious soprano voices and the
14   general presentation.


15   I was both abashed and honored that
16   the composer had lent so much effort and
17   musical learning to my work.
18   at the same time I felt that the overall
19   effect was anti-life, anti-me, anti-the-
20   clarity of directly seeking joy, pain,
21   anything reasonable or
22   sufficient.
23   it was the same old con, the same old
24   snobbism, the same old murderous kiss
25   of death clothed in a creative
26   act.


27   so I wrote the gentleman back, "you know,
28   I have certain problems, one of them
29   being with instruments.
30   some instruments which I dislike
31   are the piano, the violin and the soprano
32   voice, especially the latter.
33   the human voice besides being basically
34   ugly also reminds me of the human
35   race
36   and one of the last things I want to

[Page 196 ]


37   think of and one of the first things I
38   want to get away from when I listen to
39   classical music is
40   the human
41   race.
42   I write for the same reason.
43   is it possible that you can rewrite this
44   whole thing
45   without using the above-mentioned
46   instruments?"


47   I haven't heard from this composer
48   since.
49   which is part of my plan.
50   the other part being to antagonize,
51   deplete, expose and shame
52   the thousands of practitioners of
53   the arts in all of their forms
54   who have been subsidized by
55   snobbery, dullness, and the willful
56   push toward fame
57   which has left us with
58   centuries of accepted
59   and immensely admired
60   works of
61   art of
62   which
63   all too many
64   are surely
65   useless,
66   worthless,
67   fake
68   and so supremely boring
69   that we think that
70   they certainly must be
71   something
72   real.


[Page 197 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  a curious thing [from Bone Palace Ballet:
        New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I have known a great many women
2   and one common little quirk
3   that I have
4   noticed
5   occurs most often when eating
6   out.
7   I will be speaking
8   and perhaps it will not be
9   vitally interesting
10   but the lady will suddenly
11   turn her face away from me,
12   and will gaze across the
13   room intently
14   at a group at another
15   table.
16   most often I will simply
17   stop what I am
18   saying and wait for
19   her attention to
20   return.
21   at other times I will say,
22   "oh, is it somebody you
23   know?"
24   or,
25   "is it something
26   interesting?"
27   "no," they will
28   answer.
29   and if the lady then
30   rises and goes to
31   the restroom
32   I will check the group
33   at the table
34   who stole her
35   attention
36   and see only a bevy
37   of quite common
38   dolts.

[Page 198 ]




39   or
40   I will be speaking
41   and a group will
42   enter and as
43   they walk by
44   her attention will shift
45   and her eyes will
46   feast on them
47   as if she had seen
48   something
49   extraordinary.
50   I don't bother to
51   check out these
52   newcomers myself.
53   I feel their
54   death-glow
55   as they walk
56   past.


57   now, what I
58   mean to say here is that
59   I might often be
60   a bore
61   and not worth
62   listening to
63   but then I wonder
64   why the ladies
65   are there with
66   me in the
67   first
68   place?


69   I will admit
70   that often as they
71   converse with me
72   I find their
73   conversation
74   vapid or
75   worse
76   but I hear them

[Page 199 ]


77   out,
78   often interjecting a
79   little nod
80   or an affirmation
81   such as, "yes ..."
82   or a simple
83   "uh huh ..."
84   but I never turn
85   directly away
86   and focus my attention
87   elsewhere
88   especially in
89   mid-speech.


90   when they take their
91   attention away
92   like that
93   I do believe that
94   they think that they
95   are being
96   worldly and
97   observant.
98   but it's terribly
99   clear.
100   don't they know
101   I can
102   read this
103   behavior?


104   it's true that people
105   can be together
106   too much,
107   too long,
108   it can be awful,
109   it can be a bore
110   and a
111   grind.
112   and then when I suggest
113   to the lady
114   that perhaps we had

[Page 200 ]


115   best forget the
116   whole matter and
117   go our separate
118   ways,
119   once again
120   I get a common
121   reaction:
122   "WHAT DO YOU MEAN?"
123   then there are
124   tears.
125   as if all
126   that has occurred
127   had not
128   occurred,
129   as if all was sweet
130   and
131   well.


132   but the continual
133   nuances cannot
134   be ignored.
135   all disinterest isn't
136   sexual.


137   "YOU ARE A BASTARD!
138   YOU ARE A HORRIBLE
139   MAN!"


140   yes, yes, yes I am
141   and the gods and the
142   ladies have made
143   me so.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the finger [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the drivers of automobiles
2   have very little recourse or
3   originality.
4   when upset with
5   another
6   driver
7   they often give him the
8   FINGER.


9   I have seen two adult
10   men,
11   florid of face
12   driving along
13   giving each other the
14   FINGER.


15   well, we all know what
16   this means, it's no
17   secret.


18   still, this gesture is
19   so overused it has
20   lost most of its
21   impact.


22   some of the men who give
23   the FINGER are captains of
24   industry, city councilmen,
25   insurance adjusters,
26   accountants and/or the just plain
27   unemployed.
28   no matter.
29   it is their favorite
30   response.


31   people will never admit
32   that they drive
33   badly.

[Page 202 ]




34   the FINGER is their
35   reply.


36   I see grown men
37   FINGERING each other
38   throughout the day.


39   it gives me pause.
40   when I consider
41   the state of our cities,
42   the state of our states,
43   the state of our country,
44   I begin to
45   understand.


46   the FINGER is a mind-
47   set.
48   we are the FINGERERS.
49   we give it
50   to each other.
51   we give it coming and
52   going.
53   we don't know how
54   else to respond.


55   what a hell of a way
56   to not
57   live.

1   there is always somebody or something
2   waiting for you,
3   something stronger, more intelligent,
4   more evil, more kind, more durable,
5   something bigger, something better,
6   something worse, something with
7   eyes like the tiger, jaws like the shark,
8   something crazier than crazy,
9   saner than sane,
10   there is always something or somebody
11   waiting for you
12   as you put on your shoes
13   or as you sleep
14   or as you empty a garbage can
15   or pet your cat
16   or brush your teeth
17   or celebrate a holiday
18   there is always somebody or something
19   waiting for you.


20   keep this fully in mind

22   you will be as ready as possible.


23   meanwhile, a good day to

1   totally written out at 2 a.m.

3   lady
4   or driving home in a police
5   car.
6   all I have to do is to toddle into
7   the next room
8   flop on the bed
9   and sleep it away.
10   the good wife will check my
11   breathing.
12   you can end safe

18   you can't stay safe too
19   long.
20   I'll go crazy at least
21   4 more times before I
22   earn my gravestone,
23   but meanwhile
24   I'll toddle off
25   as the gods smile
26   and say,
27   "Jesus Christ, is this the same
28   guy who fought monsters
29   in dark alleys for the mere sake
30   of
31   entertainment?"


32   there's some damn fool
33   out there
34   who will take my
35   place
36   one
37   day.

[Page 205 ]




38   meanwhile, look, there's a
39   gulp of beer left
40   and an upside-down
41   universe.


42   you be safe for a while,
43   I'll cut the swath.


44   you can't all be me
45   but at least
46   try not to be
47   them.
48   please.

2   bullets and lives.

4   as the blackbird

        Bukowski, Charles :  one of those [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   Sartre was some fellow, oh yes,
2   he showed us the bone of
3   Nowhere and shook it in
4   our face.
5   the choice
6   is yours,
7   he said,
8   morals died with God,
9   you're on your
10   own.


11   every now and then,
12   during the passing centuries,
13   some giant among men
14   arises,
15   shakes us truly,
16   shocks us out of our
17   sleep,
18   so that, at least for a
19   time, we become aware,
20   renewed
21   as we put our shoes on in
22   the morning,
23   as we trundle through our
24   tasks,
25   as we eat, defecate,
26   imagine love,
27   mail letters,
28   drive and walk the
29   city,
30   things and thoughts
31   assume different
32   shapes.


33   Sartre was one of those
34   giants.
35   Paris, France, much of the
36   world

[Page 208 ]


37   rumbled and bounced
38   because of
39   him.


40   without some like him,
41   putting your shoes on in
42   the morning
43   would become so difficult
44   as to be almost
45   impossible.


46   Jean Paul,
47   thanks
48   for
49   everything.

        Bukowski, Charles :  candy-ass [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the best part is that
2   after you have written 6 or 7 good poems in
3   one night
4   you can celebrate,
5   play,
6   write a candy-ass poem.
7   you can deliberately try to be bad,
8   that's fun,
9   most do it without trying.


10   that anger you?
11   good.
12   hope it makes your mother angry
13   too.
14   many mothers get angry about what I
15   write.
16   when they stop getting angry I'm
17   going to pack it in,
18   join the boy scouts.
19   my mother-in-law says to my
20   wife,
21   "but WHY does he have to use the
22   LANGUAGE he does?"
23   well, dear, it's just to piss you
24   off, get your anger up.


25   life has abused me and I have mis-
26   used it.
27   I enjoy attacking the sun with a
28   squirt gun.
29   I am drunk, I will sleep on my left
30   side to awaken in the morning and
31   read this candy-ass poem,
32   wretchedly.


[Page 210 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  the word [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the word has no legs or eyes,
2   has no mouth, has no arms,
3   has no intestines and
4   often no heart, or very
5   little.


6   you can't ask the word to
7   light your cigarette
8   although it will help you
9   enjoy your wine.


10   and you can't force the word
11   to do anything it doesn't
12   want to do.
13   you can't overwork it.
14   and you can't awaken it
15   when it decides to
16   sleep.


17   the word will treat you well
18   at times,
19   depending upon what you
20   ask it to
21   do.
22   other times, it will treat
23   you badly
24   no matter what you ask
25   it to
26   do.


27   the word comes and
28   goes.
29   sometimes you must
30   wait a very long time
31   for it.
32   sometimes it never
33   comes back.

[Page 211 ]




34   sometimes writers
35   kill themselves
36   when the word
37   leaves.
38   other writers will
39   pretend that it is still
40   there
41   even though the word
42   is dead and
43   buried.


44   many famous writers
45   do this.
46   and many less-famous
47   who
48   only call themselves
49   writers.


50   the word is not for
51   everybody.
52   and for most,
53   it's there
54   just for a very short
55   time.


56   the word is one of
57   the most
58   powerful miracles
59   in
60   existence,
61   it can enlighten or
62   destroy
63   minds,
64   nations,
65   cultures.


66   the word is dangerous
67   and beautiful.


68   if it arrives for you,

[Page 212 ]


69   you will know
70   it
71   and you will be the
72   luckiest of
73   humans.
74   nothing else will
75   matter and
76   everything else will
77   matter.


78   you will be the
79   center of the
80   sun,
81   you will be laughing
82   through the
83   centuries,
84   you will have
85   it,
86   your fingers
87   your guts
88   will have
89   it,
90   you will be,
91   for as long as it
92   lasts,
93   a god-damned
94   writer
95   doing the possible
96   impossible,
97   getting it down,
98   getting it down,
99   getting it
100   down.

3   and their relaxed
4   effrontery,
5   their crossed legs and their canvas
6   shoes,
7   their soft bellies, their soft
8   minds,
9   their cagey courtesy,
10   their pallid smiles,
11   their needless tinkering with your

24   there by the blinds,
25   nibbling bits of food,
26   savoring the wine,
27   sitting their dumb asses upon
28   the commodes,
29   staying an extra day,

31   an extra life,
32   so content,
33   wallowing in your
34   sight,
35   saved from your fury through
36   circumstance,
37   they fatten before you
38   stuffing their mouths with

39   olives, fruit and chips,
40   smiling through wine-wet lips ...


41   others must see something in
42   them,
43   need something from
44   them
45   while I shudder in
46   my damned guts
47   in disbelief
48   at what confronts
49   me.


50   they notice nothing,
51   yawn,
52   and stretch their legs
53   through my
54   space.

        Bukowski, Charles :  Dreiser wasn't so hot either [from Bone
        Palace Ballet: New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   he is really a nice fellow
2   of good heart
3   but I don't know what to do
4   with him:
5   he is bitten by too much
6   enthusiasm.


7   and I have no desire to
8   hurt him.


9   he phones often.


10   "I'm working on my novel," he'll
11   say.


12   "good," I'll
13   answer.


14   "123 pages ..."


15   "good ..."


16   "you remember what you told
17   me?" he will
18   say.


19   "what?"


20   "'never write until you really
21   have to, never write until it
22   /leaps/ on you and grabs you
23   by the throat.'"


24   "yes ..."


25   "I waited and now I'm up to
26   page
27   123 ..."

[Page 217 ]




28   then he'll talk about other
29   things, and then
30   a lot more about the
31   novel.
32   then it will be
33   over.


34   "was that Harry?" my wife will
35   ask.


36   "yes, it was Harry ..."


37   a day or so will pass,
38   I'll drive in from
39   the track
40   and my wife will
41   say, "Harry phoned."


42   "ah ..."


43   "he talked about his
44   novel ..."


45   "123 pages ..."


46   "135 pages ... he also
47   said he created
48   a couple of
49   new
50   characters."


51   "yes, he told me and
52   I told him that it was
53   all right: it's
54   fiction ..."


55   "he tells us both the
56   same things," my wife
57   says.

[Page 218 ]




58   "yes ..."


59   usually Harry phones
60   in the mornings, I only
61   wish he'd wait until
62   nightfall
63   but
64   he's excited.


65   it could be a good
66   novel, maybe it
67   is, I hope so,
68   only
69   I wish he wouldn't
70   talk about it
71   all the
72   time.


73   "I wish he wouldn't talk
74   about
75   the novel," I tell my
76   wife.


77   "why don't you tell
78   him?"


79   "Christ, I can't totally
80   discourage this
81   guy!"


82   "he likes you,
83   so tell him ..."


84   "look, F. Scott Fitzgerald used
85   to read his stuff
86   to his woman
87   right after he wrote
88   it.
89   that's
90   even worse than

[Page 219 ]


91   talking about
92   it."


93   "but
94   you once said
95   F. Scott Fitzgerald
96   was the most over-rated
97   writer of
98   our time ..."


99   "I just can't tell Harry
100   to
101   stop talking about
102   his novel," I reply.


103   "he's your friend ..."


104   "maybe he's /your/ friend,"
105   I tell her.


106   "but
107   I'm no writer ..."


108   "for this," I tell her,
109   "let us bless the
110   gods and everything
111   else."

        Bukowski, Charles :  cruising [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   totally mentally ripped,
2   driving the streets in the afternoon,
3   stopping at signals,
4   looking at people walking on the
5   sidewalks,
6   it's reality but a reality that has
7   faded away.
8   you know your judgment is
9   warped but you don't give a
10   damn.
11   too long on earth, that's it,
12   that's your problem.
13   a story told too often.


14   the signal changes and you
15   cross the avenue,
16   enter a side street,
17   drive along
18   the houses are small and
19   sad,
20   have no heart.
21   the asphalt boils under
22   your wheels
23   and there's no place to
24   go,
25   no surprise, no wonder-
26   ment.


27   too long on earth, old
28   dog, you are dirtied with
29   life.


30   you circle back to the
31   avenue,
32   park behind a taco
33   stand, get out,
34   walk to the counter,
35   wait.

[Page 221 ]




36   a heavy girl approaches.
37   she stands, looks at
38   you.
39   you pretend to be
40   composed.
41   "coffee," you say,
42   "small, black ..."


43   she smiles at you.
44   the smile says:
45   I know you're crazy
46   but it's all
47   right.


48   you get the coffee,
49   take it back to the
50   car.
51   you are facing a
52   dirty dark yellow
53   wall.
54   you sip the
55   coffee:
56   bitter horrible
57   swill.


58   you drink half a
59   cup, dump it out the
60   window, back out of
61   there
62   and then you're
63   driving west.


64   a psychiatrist won't
65   help,
66   a psychologist won't
67   help,
68   a god won't
69   help.
70   drinking's old
71   and drugs make it

[Page 222 ]


72   worse.


73   you just drive in your
74   car.
75   for a hundred years.
76   for centuries.
77   your head ripped
78   rising up through
79   the sun
80   roof
81   lolling on a long snake
82   neck
83   smiling a bloody
84   smile,
85   paradise at
86   last.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the way it is [from Bone Palace Ballet: New

1   almost everybody here is on
2   drugs
3   but the real pros
4   continue to function
5   all day and into the
6   night,
7   handling their affairs,
8   getting their clean laundry,
9   paying some of the
10   bills,
11   going on,
12   like that,
13   it's a comedy,
14   almost an accepted
15   way of life.
16   this neighborhood is
17   full of them,
18   they walk in and out of their
19   houses and jump into their
20   cars, they appear to be
21   ordinary citizens
22   unless you really
23   know them.
24   they have children,
25   they vote sometimes,
26   they watch tv,
27   they appear to be
28   normal citizens
29   and what they are
30   finally becomes normal
31   for them,
32   hundreds of people
33   in this neighborhood
34   drugged
35   continually.
36   it's a quietly accepted
37   fact.
38   they need the stuff to

[Page 224 ]


39   go on,
40   we all know this
41   but nothing is ever
42   said about it
43   as the police
44   (paid by
45   the taxes of the
46   users)
47   bust the
48   asses of the
49   sellers
50   in this quiet
51   lovely

1   near the end of the interview he leaned forward and
2   asked, "now is there any final word you'd like to leave with
3   your audience?"


4   "no," I answered, "no final word."


5   I felt his disappointment.


6   "no final word?" he asked again.


7   "no," I said.


8   he had wanted a nice closer, he had wanted me to save
9   his ass,
10   he had wanted me to save the ass of my audience.
11   well, I had worked hard enough to save my own ass.


12   "o.k.," he recovered himself and said to me, "it's been
13   a real pleasure to interview
14   you."


15   "sure, baby," I said.


16   then he motioned to the camera and sound men that
17   it was over
18   and they began packing their
19   gear.


20   "you fellows care for a drink?" I asked.


21   "no thanks." the interviewer spoke for everybody, they were
22   pulling plugs from the walls, folding equipment into
23   cases, it was as if I no longer
24   existed.


25   they had what they needed.


26   I stood with cigar and drink and watched them file out

[Page 226 ]


27   the door and into the night.


28   then they were gone with their asses that needed saving
29   even worse than mine.

        Bukowski, Charles :  each man's hell is different [from Bone

1   I get reports about a dear friend in
2   Europe, this man is not the complaining
3   type
4   so what I've learned doesn't come from
5   him
6   but he can't hide everything
7   and some of it filters through from other
8   sources:
9   he must go to the hospital every other
10   day, he is dying by the god-damned
11   inch.
12   his home life has long been
13   unhappy
14   and now
15   his wife has become
16   suicidal.
17   most of my letters to him
18   go unanswered
19   and when he does
20   reply
21   the responses are clipped and
22   stark.


23   I've learned he can't drink, smoke,
24   ever consume coffee
25   and
26   there are
27   occupational
28   problems.


29   he's not old.


30   my friend always wanted to be
31   a writer
32   he became a translator
33   working the language of the
34   successful practitioners
35   into his own.

36   the long hard hours
37   with the dream
38   getting further
39   and further out of
40   reach,
41   his wife going
42   mad:


43   "you're always
44   /typing/ !"


45   a killing unhappiness:
46   never knowing
47   what you might have
48   been.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the powers that be [from Bone Palace
        Ballet: New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   there was a crowd at this dinner.
2   they were all telling jokes of
3   one sort or another,
4   some of them were professional
5   actors, directors of note, writers,
6   and it gave me a little
7   tingle to be with such talented
8   humans.
9   there was a lull, finally,
10   and I began telling about something
11   that was not a joke.
12   about something that had happened to me.
13   I mean, I wasn't serious but at the
14   same time I was serious,
15   trying to explain what
16   had occurred, about
17   something that might occur
18   unexpectedly in any man's life,
19   something to be understood,
20   something to cherish.
21   I guess it was
22   a rather philosophical story
23   informed by decades of
24   my living life out.


25   then, I was finished.
26   there was silence.
27   nobody agreed or disagreed.
28   and then, at once, they all began
29   again
30   chatting about
31   little happenings,
32   the waiter appeared and

34   desserts and libations,
35   further in-jokes and out-jokes,

37   glass enclosures,

38   eyes locked and unlocked,
39   lips opened,
40   mouths smiled, hands
41   gestured,

43   informed our way,

        Bukowski, Charles :  clever [from Bone Palace Ballet: New Poems
        (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   the clever people slide downstream like
2   white fish
3   through the blue water,
4   past the rapids,
5   the clever people
6   with their clever throats and eyebrows,
7   their clever nostril hairs,
8   both shoes laced,
9   all dooms erased,
10   teeth white,
11   the clever people slide cleanly,
12   even their deaths are one-tenth deaths,
13   clever clever clever,
14   they have better walls,
15   better cars,
16   a better way to laugh.
17   even their nightmares are ringed with
18   tinsel,
19   these clever ones,
20   they sit across from you,
21   whitely smiling,
22   full of it,
23   even the hair on their head
24   glints cleanly.
25   how long have I lived and looked
26   upon them.
27   do you know what death really is?
28   it's one of these clever
29   cocksuckers
30   shaking your hand and
31   embracing
32   you.
33   you know what death really
34   is?
35   come see me
36   as I slip the Gold Card
37   to the waiter
38   while

[Page 232 ]


39   disliking
40   you. or
41   worse.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the poem [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   they all keep publishing poems
2   but it's doubtful what a
3   poem can really accomplish.


4   centuries of poems
5   and we're back to the
6   starting point.


7   like philosophy, history,
8   medicine, science, poems seem to
9   alter things,
10   seem to lead toward a way
11   out
12   then falter against the
13   changing currents and increasing
14   odds.


15   a poem is no better than a
16   good can opener,
17   a spare tire,
18   or
19   aspirin for a
20   headache.


21   the poem isn't much
22   but let me tell you
23   if I hadn't discovered
24   it
25   I would be dead
26   or
27   you would be dead
28   or many people
29   would be
30   dead
31   or
32   if not dead
33   then horribly
34   mutilated

[Page 234 ]


35   in one sense or
36   another.


37   still, a poem can only
38   be a poem.


39   lines like these


40   floating on a page


41   burning holes in the face of
42   death


43   twisting the cap off the tube
44   of
45   night


46   following the dog of summer
47   to the end of his
48   rope.


49   huh?


[Page 235 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  my mail [from Bone Palace Ballet: New Poems
        (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   keeps evolving and there is more
2   of it.
3   in the old days
4   many letters were from ladies,
5   often with photos.
6   I'd tell them to come visit
7   and I met them at the airport
8   and drove them
9   home.
10   then there was drinking and
11   sex.
12   most stayed two or three days,
13   then left.


14   there were also letters from
15   men in jail, some as far away as
16   Australia.
17   I answered these letters.
18   there were also letters from
19   poets, known and
20   unknown.
21   then there were a few mental
22   cases.
23   I answered these as well.
24   the problem was that they all
25   wanted continual
26   response,
27   a life-long correspondence.
28   when I would inform them
29   that this couldn't be done
30   I received some irrational
31   and foul responses
32   in return.


33   I found myself writing dozens
34   of letters a
35   month.
36   and my intention

[Page 236 ]


37   as a writer had not been to
38   correspond with
39   any and
40   all.


41   I finally gave up
42   babying my
43   mailbox.


44   I read my mail but in
45   90 percent of the cases
46   I didn't
47   respond.


48   I heard a story about
49   Faulkner.
50   when he got a letter
51   he held it up to the
52   light.
53   if he didn't see a check
54   in there
55   he threw it away
56   unopened.


57   I read my mail
58   then threw it
59   away.


60   now much of my mail
61   is from college
62   professors.
63   some of them are
64   precise and pleasant
65   enough
66   but few are worthy
67   of response.


68   and there are a couple of
69   self-published books of poetry
70   a week,

[Page 237 ]


71   few worthy of
72   response.


73   the ladies and the
74   convicts and the madmen
75   have dropped
76   away.


77   I still get letters from
78   people who announce they will
79   soon be in town to
80   "drink 8 or ten beers" with
81   me ...


82   my job
83   as a writer
84   is to write.
85   I am not a counselor
86   nor an entertainer,
87   nor am I interested in
88   reading books of
89   poesy
90   or bedding down
91   or giving blurbs
92   or recommending unsung
93   so-called geniuses
94   to my
95   publisher.


96   when I was an unknown
97   writer
98   I sent my work
99   directly to the magazines
100   and the publishers,
101   never with a cover
102   letter,
103   and I never knocked on
104   anybody's
105   door
106   and I never read my

[Page 238 ]


107   work to my wives or
108   my girlfriends
109   or anybody.


110   when you are in a prize fight
111   you climb into the
112   ring,
113   you do it where it is
114   done.
115   and it's not done at
116   literary parties or by
117   writing Burroughs or
118   Mailer
119   or Ferlinghetti.


120   you sit down at your
121   machine
122   and fire it into the
123   unknown,
124   and if you don't have
125   a machine
126   you write it on the
127   walls or on the edges
128   of newspapers.
129   and you'll keep doing
130   it,
131   doing it,
132   and if you've got
133   it,
134   the guts and the
135   laughter and the manner
136   of saying it
137   you'll finally come
138   through.
139   forget everything
140   else.


141   the gods are good,
142   they only want to
143   make sure.

2   with the dead and standing in the supermarket

4   what the doctor ordered is
5   not what I ordered

7   not what we ordered.

        Bukowski, Charles :  up through the night [from Bone Palace
        Ballet: New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the way I can tell it is the Christmas
2   season is that the classical
3   music on the radio gets
4   bad.
5   I mean with an exception or two
6   we are left in a musical vacuum.
7   music
8   like any other creative endeavor
9   must have its own personal
10   meaning,
11   must find its own way.
12   it can't be programmed by general
13   agreement
14   or somebody's mother-in-law's
15   concept of
16   what is appropriate
17   for the season.


18   things with their own power
19   and with a life of their own
20   go their own way
21   make their own statements
22   bring light by their own
23   magic.
24   it's what makes death
25   bearable and life worth
26   discarding.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the fool dines out [from Bone Palace
        Ballet: New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I am with others, including my wife, it is a dark and
2   expensive place, we order wine, high-
3   priced stuff, the waiter brings it, applies corkscrew,
4   pulls, and the prong rips out of the cork leaving
5   said cork within the bottle, so he reinserts the cork-
6   screw, tugs, and it happens again---corkscrew in
7   the air, cork in the bottle.


8   "having a little trouble, eh?" I
9   ask him.


10   my wife digs an elbow to my ribs, the waiter goes off
11   for another bottle, returns, digs the corkscrew in again
12   ---same thing: out comes the corkscrew without the cork.


13   "you need another opener," I
14   suggest.


15   I get another dig in the ribs, the waiter glowers at me,
16   he's enraged, gives it another try, same result.


17   "wow!" I say.


18   the others at the table look at me as if I had just been
19   convicted of child-rape and now everybody is enraged
20   except me as the waiter goes for a third bottle, returns,
21   and as he inserts the corkscrew he fixes his eyes on
22   me and I silently (of course) wish
23   him luck and this time he
24   makes it.


25   I am the wine-taster, he pours me a bit, I give it a sip,
26   wait a moment, nod to him that the wine is all
27   right.


28   for the remainder of our stay there the other people talk
29   as if I am non-existent but upon hearing the
30   conversation I am most happy

[Page 242 ]


31   that I am excluded.


32   upon leaving I pay the bill, tip 20%, and we walk to
33   the parking lot, the others feeling that they have acted
34   properly
35   in our civilization of expensive restaurants. they even
36   say goodnight to me. as the valets rush for our ex-
37   pensive cars I
38   wonder what the waiter will do with those two bottles
39   with the ruined corks, I always dig the corks out. drink
40   the wine, cork and all.


41   meanwhile my wife is waiting to tell me, when we are
42   in the car alone, that I treated the waiter quite
43   horribly, didn't I know how to act in public?


44   and I won't
45   reply.

1   sometimes it's bad or just ordinary,
2   you adjust to senseless conditions,
3   then a new card drops out of the deck,
4   it severs the tendon between the thumb
5   and the forefinger,
6   a dark electric numbness overwhelms the
7   spinal cord
8   and your mother's face appears on a
9   billboard
10   skewered as it should be,
11   advertising
12   adversity as the norm,
13   you pour a fresh drink,
14   duck down between the stink of humanity
15   and the ferocious boredom of
16   time,
17   come up once to blink,
18   go down twice to think it over,
19   dial 911
20   and get a voiceless voice
21   like the dead scream of a
22   caterpillar
23   as Rome sculpts the monster
24   and children as little
25   as flies
26   crawl the walls of your

1   we are destroyed by our
2   conscience, I explained to
3   him.


4   no, no, that's not what I
5   mean, he said.
6   I mean, I'll wake up
7   feeling good, you know,
8   ready for action, ready
9   for whatever's out there and
10   then the /first/ word she'll
11   say to me
12   will be
13   vicious and stupid,
14   really unwarranted, you know.
15   then, I'm depressed, the
16   whole day's
17   shot through the head.


18   we are destroyed by expecting
19   more than there is,
20   I said.


21   or, he continued, I'll be out
22   doing my job all day, it will be hard
23   enough, but I'll see it through
24   and I'll drive up thinking, now
25   for the good part. I'll park,
26   get out, walk in the door,
27   and she'll say something
28   totally unrelated either to her
29   or to me, I mean something that
30   is simply and violently /ugly/ ,
31   you know, and there
32   goes the evening and the night,
33   there goes any good feeling
34   I might have had.

[Page 245 ]




35   you sound like a nit-
36   pick, I said.


37   you mean these things don't
38   happen to you? he asked.
39   I mean, with your
40   woman?


41   never, I told him.


42   no problems? she respects you?
43   he asked.


44   she adores me, I said, the way
45   I speak, walk, talk, my
46   glow, the whole bundle.


47   I don't believe you,
48   he said.


49   you shouldn't, I
50   answered.


51   why do women act
52   like that? he
53   asked.


54   it's love, I answered,
55   they care.


56   maybe it would be better
57   if they hated us?
58   he asked.


59   they do, I said.


60   I just wish they'd treat us
61   with the same respect they
62   treat strangers, he
63   said.

[Page 246 ]




64   we couldn't stand that,
65   I said.


66   you mean we get what we
67   need? he asked.


68   we need what we get, I
69   told him.


70   is there anything else?
71   he asked.


72   not today, I said, we've
73   been talking an hour---
74   that's $150.


75   I think you've
76   compounded my
77   problems, he
78   said.


79   maybe, I told him, and
80   that's why you should
81   come again
82   next week.
83   I guess so, he
84   said.


85   I'll see you then, I told
86   him, good
87   day.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the new homeless [from Bone Palace Ballet:
        New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I've
2   been driving down this tree-lined street for
3   12 years or so
4   on my way to wherever, past
5   the rich homes, the pony trails, past
6   the lush smell of money and
7   security.
8   but now
9   in these strangest of times,
10   parts of the structure suddenly
11   topple,
12   taking with it some of the modestly
13   rich
14   on a long
15   dark ride.
16   others remain untouched,
17   but in today's newspaper I read
18   that some of these 850,000 dollar homes
19   have been built over a land-
20   fill.
21   driveways are cracking,
22   back yards are sinking,
23   houses are tilting, walls and
24   foundations are cracking,
25   there are loud explosions in the
26   night.
27   there are sink-holes in the ground
28   from which emanate
29   stinking gasses which may
30   be poisonous and
31   explosive.
32   the trees are dying and
33   nothing will grow in the
34   yards.
35   the homes are un-
36   salable
37   but still taxed at the
38   former level.

[Page 254 ]




39   even the pony trails are
40   sagging, dangerous.
41   the horses stay in their
42   collapsing stables ...


43   these were the people
44   who thought they had
45   beat the
46   system,
47   made the educated and
48   intelligent
49   choices.


50   now, they are
51   finished.
52   and the builders and the
53   realtors
54   who swindled them
55   are long
56   gone
57   to safer, richer
58   climes.


59   America the beautiful
60   suddenly turned
61   ugly
62   time after time,
63   in life after life,
64   in way after way,
65   some will
66   always be
67   classically
68   screwed.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the mail [from Bone Palace Ballet: New

1   the mail gets heavier.
2   more and more letters telling me
3   what a great writer I
4   am,
5   plus poems, novels, novelettes,
6   short stories, paintings.
7   some just want an autograph,
8   a drawing, a word.
9   others suggest an ongoing
10   correspondence.


11   I read everything, dump every-
12   thing, go about my
13   business.


14   I am aware that no man is
15   a "great" writer.
16   he may have been a
17   great writer,
18   but it's a process which
19   begins again and over
20   again
21   and all the praise,
22   the cigars, the bottles of
23   wine sent in
24   honor
25   will not get the next
26   line down,
27   and that's all that counts,
28   the past is
29   useless,
30   now is in the laps of
31   the gods
32   as the centuries fall
33   away
34   in their rotten
35   swift
36   luxury.

11   they don't believe it.
12   and so nothing leads
13   anywhere
14   and it's just another day
15   wasted,
16   kicked in the ass,
17   mutilated
18   while the Buddha
19   sits in the corner
20   smiling.

        Bukowski, Charles :  wait, it will find us [from Bone Palace
        Ballet: New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   a day at the track,
2   followed by a swim in the
3   pool,
4   followed by 5 minutes in the
5   spa,
6   followed by a shower,
7   followed by opening the mail
8   (not very interesting
9   mail)
10   then the good wife
11   recounts some portion of
12   her day,
13   the seven cats greet me
14   one by one
15   and the evening has
16   begun.


17   from original hell to this.
18   can I bear
19   it?
20   can you?


21   don't worry,
22   hell will return, grown
23   stronger,
24   it will find me
25   again
26   older, fatter
27   and I will report the
28   matter to you,
29   dear reader,
30   in the fashion that
31   you have become
32   accustomed
33   to.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the x-factor [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   pain in back, feel bloated, should cut my
2   toenails,
3   smoking here
4   past midnight,
5   radio turned low,
6   warm night,
7   I have my view of the
8   freeway,
9   I'm still alive
10   but not so sure of the
11   others,
12   I keep getting approached by
13   strangers at the racetrack
14   who want to talk,
15   they push their faces too
16   close,
17   I am stricken by their
18   eyes,
19   they jabber away
20   like monkeys in a
21   zoo
22   and finally
23   I break away,
24   ride the escalator a
25   while,
26   sometimes go out to
27   parking,
28   walk in the sun,
29   come back,
30   watch another god-
31   damned horse
32   race.


33   I feel tired and bloated
34   with it
35   all,
36   thinking back
37   now

[Page 259 ]


38   on the day.
39   yes, I won, yes.


40   but I've got to think of
41   something
42   else.
43   maybe I'll hang around
44   Art Museums?
45   no.
46   awful.
47   maybe I'll play with
48   paints?
49   ah, no.


50   you know, this sitting
51   around waiting to
52   die,
53   it's not a very kind
54   hobby.


55   I watch the smoke
56   drift about the
57   room, turn up the
58   radio.


59   I tell you, I don't mind
60   death
61   but it pisses me off
62   when the animals
63   die.


64   well, here I am
65   sitting in my shorts,
66   complaining
67   again.


68   and getting paid
69   for it.


70   who could have
71   ever guessed?

        Bukowski, Charles :  evaluation [from Bone Palace Ballet: New

1   oh yes, I'm a good guy,
2   as soon as the toilet paper
3   runs low,
4   I'll take it out and replace
5   it
6   with a full fat roll.
7   I don't live
8   alone
9   and I am aware
10   that a sudden unwilling search
11   of that dark blank
12   cardboard
13   can jinx this tender mood
14   or write a curse
15   on the cool tile
16   wall.


17   good guys like me are needed in
18   this more than difficult
19   world.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the young [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I watch them going up and down the hill on their
2   Suzukis, gunning them, ripping the night with
3   sound, the lights are bright, up and down
4   the hill they go, it's only Thursday
5   night but any night will do, there's hardly
6   any place to go, gang territory across Pacific
7   Avenue and more gangs on Gaffey Street, only
8   a few safe blocks to play with and they park
9   their bikes, stand around talking, there's not
10   much money, they share joints and a few pills,
11   school tomorrow, maybe, hell, maybe not.


12   I stand out front watering a patch of lawn, maybe they
13   see me, and if they do, it doesn't matter, I'm just
14   another old fart in a world of old farts, yet I
15   feel like walking over and saying, "come on,
16   let's find something to do ..." but I know better, I know
17   that they don't know any more than I do and they
18   are probably more scared, I had my fling
19   ripping at the walls, I used to stand and beat
20   my hands against the bricks until they bled and
21   I kept punching but the world stayed there
22   unlikeable, monstrous, deadly.


23   I see them talking, then shut off the water, drag
24   the hose back into the yard, walk up the drive
25   and they are left standing in the world I passed on to them, they
26   are hopelessly screwed, castrated, denuded.


27   ---the passing of the torch through the centuries,
28   they have it now.
29   Thursday night, nowhere to go.
30   Friday night. Saturday. Sunday. Monday.
31   etc.
32   the oldest young on earth.
33   Thursday night. Thursday night. Thursday
34   night.


35   "come on, let's find something to do ..."

        Bukowski, Charles :  no return address [from Bone Palace Ballet:

1   I am perishable and that's the best
2   part
3   as the snail crawls slowly under
4   the leaf,
5   as the lady in the cafe
6   laughs an ugly laugh,
7   as France burns in purple
8   twilight.
9   I am perishable
10   and good for that
11   as the horse kicks a slat out of the
12   barn,
13   as we hurry toward
14   paradise,
15   I am perishable enough.
16   place the empty shoes beneath the
17   bed
18   side by side.
19   as the dog howls
20   the last frog puffs and

        Bukowski, Charles :  snapshot (1985) [from Bone Palace Ballet:

1   flailing away at infinity
2   the tiny winged night bug
3   on its back
4   under the desk lamp
5   kicks and struggles with
6   thread legs
7   under the heat of the
8   light
9   as in the corner of the
10   room
11   my fat yellow cat
12   lifts his left leg
13   high
14   and licks his precious
15   parts
16   as in the harbor now
17   a boat suddenly looses
18   a horn sound


19   the cat stiffens, stops
20   licking


21   the bug becomes
22   motionless


23   then,
24   both at once,
25   they return to their
26   former
27   divertissements.

        Bukowski, Charles :  finished? [from Bone Palace Ballet: New

1   the critics now have me
2   drinking champagne and
3   driving a BMW
4   and also married to a
5   socialite from
6   Philadelphia's Main Line
7   which of course
8   is going to prevent me
9   from writing my earthy
10   and grubby stuff.
11   and they might be
12   right,
13   I could be getting to be
14   more like them,
15   and that's as close to
16   death as you can
17   get.


18   we'll see.
19   but don't bury me yet.
20   don't worry if I drink with
21   Sean Penn.
22   just measure the poems
23   as they come off the
24   keyboard.
25   listen only to them.
26   after this long fight
27   I have no intention of
28   quitting short.
29   or late.
30   or satisfied.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the voice of Chinaski [from Bone Palace
        Ballet: New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   modern composers are writing pieces using
2   the voice of the whale---
3   working it into
4   music.


5   the whale has a feeding ground of twenty
6   square miles
7   which he patrols and uses
8   alone


9   until the time comes when he starts
10   calling for his
11   mate---
12   then this voice is sent trumpeting through the
13   water


14   those waters of used tires and inner
15   tubes, old blankets and piano wire
16   discarded test tubes and burnt-out Spanish
17   bullfighters.


18   get lonely get
19   horny.


20   we're all caught
21   the same:
22   goldfish
23   dove
24   dog
25   tiger.


26   sometimes even mountains
27   move
28   boil out in
29   flame.


30   you have me
31   and the nuns and the monks have
32   God.

        Bukowski, Charles :  quotable [from Bone Palace Ballet: New

1   she is an old woman
2   now
3   still quite beautiful
4   she has known many
5   famous
6   men.


7   we are sitting in a Mexican cafe
8   and she tells me,
9   "Hemingway was an amazing
10   man, he'd sit and
11   make these off-hand remarks,
12   one after another, these
13   astonishing truthful statements ..."


14   I like that.
15   but I have nothing to
16   say.


17   well, I do.
18   I tell her: "the red
19   sauce in the little bowl
20   is very hot so
21   don't use it unless you
22   like that sort of
23   thing."


24   ---such statements don't
25   create a legend
26   but for ordinary mortals
27   they still have a
28   rather
29   sturdy
30   worth.

        Bukowski, Charles :  interview [from Bone Palace Ballet: New

1   what would you do if you had 5 minutes to
2   live? he asked.


3   nothing.


4   really?


5   yes, nothing.


6   all right, suppose you had 2
7   weeks?


8   nothing.


9   come on, don't say that, be
10   /serious/ !


11   I think I
12   am.


13   all right, suppose you had 2
14   /months/ ?


15   either hold up a bank or take
16   up
17   water-skiing.


18   you're not being /serious/
19   about this whole
20   thing.


21   so I asked him:
22   what would you do
23   if you had 2 months to
24   live?


25   well, he answered, I'd
26   drink and fuck,

[Page 269 ]


27   plenty.


28   o.k., put me down for
29   the same thing.


30   /now/ you're talking!
31   he said.


32   for a man with 2 months to
33   live
34   he looked pretty
35   satisfied.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the lady who looks forever young [from Bone

1   is in trouble:
2   the famous place she has gone to for all these
3   years for
4   face-lifts
5   refuses to give her
6   another:
7   the skin on her face is stretched so
8   tight
9   that she's like a balloon about to
10   burst
11   and they will not accept the
12   responsibility
13   of having her smile into another
14   camera
15   and exploding
16   like a tomato blasted by a
17   firecracker
18   all over the lens and all over
19   the people.


20   poor doll.
21   she's just another one of our
22   ageless
23   stars.
24   but have cheer: she'll never
25   die: film lasts longer than we
26   do.

        Bukowski, Charles :  an answer [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   within the past six years
2   there have been four
3   different rumors that I
4   have died.
5   I don't know who begins
6   these rumors
7   or why.
8   and certainly humans
9   do worse things than
10   this.
11   yet I always feel strange
12   when I must inform people
13   that I am
14   not yet dead.
15   somebody out there
16   or perhaps several
17   people
18   evidently get some
19   huge satisfaction
20   in announcing that I am
21   no longer
22   around.


23   some day,
24   some night
25   the announcement will be
26   true.
27   to put it mildly,
28   I am no longer
29   young.
30   but these death-
31   wishers
32   are an unsavory
33   group,
34   these hyenas,
35   these vultures,
36   these failed writers,
37   will also some day

[Page 272 ]


38   be dead,
39   their petty bitterness,
40   their lying gutless
41   beings swallowed by
42   the dark.
43   but for the moment,
44   I am here
45   and these last lines
46   are for them:
47   your cowardice will
48   not be
49   missed
50   and you were
51   dead
52   long
53   before
54   me.

        Bukowski, Charles :  a model [from Bone Palace Ballet: New Poems
        (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I want to be like that
2   man who entered the
3   restaurant
4   tonight,
5   he parked right in
6   front
7   of the front
8   door.
9   blocking off a good many
10   parked cars,
11   then slammed his car
12   door shut,
13   walked in,
14   his shirt hanging out
15   over his big
16   gut.
17   when he saw the
18   maitre d', he
19   said, "hey, Frank,
20   get me a fucking
21   table by the
22   window!"
23   and Frank smiled and followed
24   him
25   along.


26   I want to be like
27   that man.
28   this way's not
29   working.


30   for over 70 years
31   now.

        Bukowski, Charles :  my companion [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   pissing in the toilet bowl
2   the centuries whirl past
3   me
4   and that lovely lady,
5   Suicide,
6   the only lovely
7   lady,
8   appears once again,
9   she knows me.
10   the walls are cream
11   yellow.


12   I flush,
13   return my penis to its
14   hiding place,
15   wash my foolish
16   hands,
17   walk from the
18   bathroom to this
19   room.


20   she has followed
21   me.


22   outside the night is
23   past midnight.
24   inside, there is no
25   time.


26   I uncap the beer
27   bottle,
28   swallow down
29   Rome,
30   Carthage,
31   yesterday and
32   the churning of
33   now.

[Page 275 ]




34   she watches me
35   and waits.


36   I scratch my neck
37   as the entire
38   earth
39   comes in through
40   the window.
41   it has a form.
42   the form is a
43   body of dark
44   air.


45   the lady waits
46   for my love
47   as I notice the
48   hairs on my
49   arms,
50   the veins on
51   my hands.


52   I light a cigar,
53   inhale, then
54   exhale a cloud
55   of smoke.


56   I lift the beer
57   bottle
58   as somewhere
59   in the night
60   a dog barks
61   rapidly,
62   five times,
63   then
64   stops.


[Page 276 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  the barometer [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   when I was very young
2   I heard it from
3   my parents after they
4   discovered a few
5   early stories
6   hidden in my room:
7   "THIS IS UGLY!
8   THIS IS SHAMEFUL!"
9   I was finally
10   evicted from their
11   home
12   (which was
13   my first piece of good
14   luck).


15   then
16   after decades of
17   having my work
18   rejected
19   I had small bits
20   published
21   here and there
22   only to find many
23   critics totally
24   outraged
25   by my
26   efforts.


27   well, my parents
28   were dead,
29   they took the place
30   of my
31   dead parents.
32   I accepted the
33   justice of
34   this.


35   then I

[Page 277 ]


36   married and
37   now I hear
38   my mother-
39   in-law
40   as she exclaims to
41   my wife:
42   "WHY DOES HE HAVE
43   TO WRITE THAT
44   WAY?
45   WHY DOES HE
46   DO IT?"


47   well, you know,
48   those voices
49   past and present are
50   always going to be
51   there.
52   or hopefully
53   they always will
54   be.


55   when they stop
56   I will know
57   that I have lost
58   my spirit,
59   I will know
60   I have lost
61   touch with the
62   direct line
63   to the mad
64   and
65   laughing
66   gods.
67   I will see my
68   photo on the
69   cover of
70   /TIME/
71   and I will be
72   taught in high
73   school English

[Page 278 ]


74   along with
75   Hawthorne and
76   Whittier.


77   as long as the
78   mother-in-law
79   and many others
80   protest
81   I will know that
82   I am on the
83   trail of
84   a living and
85   lively
86   thing.


87   not that I write
88   in order to
89   create great and
90   ennobling
91   works
92   but if they
93   become so
94   and finally
95   silence
96   the grating
97   bellows of
98   idiots,
99   then let that
100   be
101   that.
102   fools sometimes create
103   genius by their
104   persistence
105   and their
106   puking empty
107   unjustified
108   horror,
109   unmitigated.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the rivers [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the rivers of hell are mine, they aren't yours,
2   they're mine, flowing hot and dirty and
3   endless,
4   they're mine, all mine,
5   special,
6   for me,
7   nobody else,
8   they're mine
9   rushing me along,
10   night and day,
11   week after week, month after month,
12   year after year,
13   they're mine,
14   you hear me?


15   I no longer try to climb out,
16   I go with the rivers,
17   I talk to the rivers,
18   I tell them things
19   like,
20   "I know you.
21   we've been together a long
22   time.
23   I expect nothing
24   else."


25   we rush toward death
26   and neither of us
27   gives a damn about
28   death,
29   we've got our own game
30   going.


31   the rivers of hell are mine,
32   mine,
33   the rivers of hell
34   flowing

36   with me,
37   my hells can only be
38   my hells,
39   if they're mine now and

41   forever,

1   if I can find one hour of peace a day
2   I can survive.
3   that's one old-fashioned hour, 60 minutes,
4   one hour, please, let me have it now, today,
5   this day, this night, which is almost over.
6   let me have that hour, something is closing
7   in, fast.


8   what a horror show it has been, to have been
9   put upon the earth for this, it's unreasonable,
10   it's beyond
11   reason.


12   a screeching doom.


13   it began so long ago.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the room [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   nothing changes,
2   I am backed into this small room
3   like all the other small
4   rooms.


5   5 decades ago
6   I sat as a young man
7   before a machine,
8   the door closed,
9   the shades pulled
10   down.


11   now it is not the same
12   machine or
13   the same
14   young man.


15   the radio plays
16   and as I hit the keys
17   I recognize the classical
18   music,
19   I heard it half a century
20   before.


21   "peace and quiet are in
22   your future."
23   was the message in a
24   fortune cookie I opened
25   this week.
26   and I thought, maybe death
27   will be
28   that.


29   backed into this small room,
30   I make my last
31   stand.


32   the walls rise splendidly

[Page 283 ]


33   up,
34   my cigarette smoke and
35   the music
36   rise.


37   the words bite into the
38   page.


39   my wrist watch on the
40   desk says
41   1:55 a.m.


42   the door is
43   open.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the two toughest [from Bone Palace Ballet:
        New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   there's this big guy comes to see me, he sits in
2   this big chair and starts smoking cigars
3   and I bring out the wine
4   and we pour it down.
5   the big guy gulps them down and I gulp
6   right along with him.
7   he doesn't say much, he's a stoic.


8   when other people visit they say, "Jesus, Hank,
9   what do you see in that guy?"
10   and I say, "hey, he's my hero, every man has to have a
11   hero."


12   the big guy just keeps lighting cigars and drinking.
13   he never even gets up to piss, he doesn't have
14   to.
15   he doesn't bother.


16   he smokes ten cigars a night and matches me
17   drink for drink.
18   he doesn't blink.
19   I don't either.


20   even when we talk about women we
21   agree.


22   it's best when we're alone because he never
23   talks to the other people.


24   and I never remember seeing him
25   leave.
26   in the morning his chair is there
27   and all the cigar stubs and
28   all the empty bottles but he's
29   gone.


30   what I like best is he never disturbs the
31   image I have of him,

[Page 285 ]


32   he's a tough son-of-a-bitch and I'm a
33   tough son-of-a-bitch
34   and we meet about once
35   every 3 months and put on our
36   performance.


37   anything more than that would
38   wipe us
39   both
40   out.


[Page 286 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  the darkening light [from Bone Palace
        Ballet: New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   there are more and more
2   old people, middle-aged
3   people, young people,
4   children, babies,
5   deaths, marriages,
6   divorces, wars,
7   diseases,
8   sparrows,
9   songs,
10   cars,
11   you,
12   us,
13   me
14   sitting at a table ordering
15   this cup of coffee as the
16   mudlark
17   strangles.

        Bukowski, Charles :  those good people [from Bone Palace Ballet:
        New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the worst celebrities often support the most noble
2   causes,
3   some because so directed by their
4   publicity agents,
5   others, of the less famous
6   variety,
7   out of their need to be
8   accepted as good
9   souls.


10   beware these who rally too often to
11   popular causes,
12   not because the cause is
13   necessarily wrong
14   but because their motive is
15   self-serving---the cause being
16   their cause.
17   those people who swarm to
18   the ringing of bells and
19   speeches to the gatherings of
20   the righteously
21   indignant---
22   and often those who
23   ring the bells and give the
24   speeches---
25   are far worse as humans
26   than that or those they might
27   praise or support
28   or preach or rail
29   against.


30   think, would you want
31   one of these
32   smiling on your couch
33   on a rainy March night
34   or
35   any night
36   at all?

        Bukowski, Charles :  horse fly [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the pimpled young man with his cap on backwards
2   came up to me at the racetrack
3   and asked, "who do you
4   like?" and I answered,
5   "don't you know that when you talk about that
6   the horse never
7   runs?"
8   he acted as if he hadn't
9   heard: "who do you like in the
10   exacta?"
11   "I don't bet exactas," I told
12   him.
13   "why?" he
14   asked.
15   "because they take 20 percent off
16   the top," I responded.
17   he acted as if that had nothing
18   to do with anything.
19   in a further effort to delete him from
20   the scene
21   I stated, "I don't bet daily doubles,
22   parlays, quinellas or
23   trifectas."
24   it was useless: "who do you like
25   in this race?" he asked
26   again.


27   "Your Mother's Ass,"
28   I informed
29   him.


30   as he checked his program
31   I walked
32   off.


[Page 289 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  night cap [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   there is no avenging angel or red burning devil
2   there is only me sitting here
3   at the age of 70
4   playing with the word.
5   I have been playing with the word for so
6   many decades now.
7   sometimes people see me on the street
8   and get excited.
9   "calm down," I tell them, "it's nothing."


10   the gods have been kind to me, being
11   neither in an institution or a
12   madhouse or a hospital.
13   considering all
14   my health is remarkably
15   good.
16   believe me, I had no idea I would
17   live this long, I had planned an
18   early exit and lived with a reckless
19   abandon.
20   don't be angry, I don't want to
21   hog the stage forever.
22   if somebody fairly good comes
23   along I will gladly step
24   aside.
25   I will write the stuff only for myself
26   and to myself,
27   which is what I have been
28   doing right along.


29   yes, yes, I've been lucky and
30   still am, and please be patient,
31   I will leave some day,
32   I will no longer defile these pages
33   with my raw and simple
34   lines.
35   I will become strangely quiet
36   and then you can

[Page 290 ]


37   relax.
38   but for now, tonight, I am
39   working,
40   classical music is again on
41   the radio,
42   I square off with the
43   computer
44   and the words form and
45   glow on the screen.
46   son-of-a-bitch, you have
47   no idea, it has been a
48   wild and lovely
49   ride.


50   now I fill my glass
51   and drink to it all:
52   to my loyal readers
53   who have kept me off
54   skid row,
55   to my wife and my
56   cats and my editor
57   and to my car
58   which waits in the
59   driveway
60   to transport me to the
61   racetrack tomorrow
62   and to the last line
63   I will ever write.
64   it has been a miracle
65   beyond all
66   miracles.


67   "here's mud in your
68   eye!" as we used to say
69   in the thirties.


70   thank you.


[Page 291 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  action [from Bone Palace Ballet: New Poems
        (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I am upstairs in pajamas and bathrobe,
2   it is one a.m.
3   then I hear it: a woman screaming,
4   it sounds as if somebody is being
5   murdered,
6   there are thudding and crashing
7   sounds,
8   it's simply brutal,
9   I walk down the stairway and out
10   the front door.
11   my wife remains
12   inside.
13   I walk down the driveway to the
14   street.
15   it's across the street and 3 houses
16   down,
17   a red car appears to be parked
18   cockeyed, half in the drive, half
19   in the street,
20   the screaming continues
21   and the brutal sounds,
22   then the red car
23   veers around, points down the
24   hill and screeches
25   off.


26   the big kid from the corner
27   house
28   walks over to where I am
29   standing.
30   "what the hell's
31   happening?" I ask
32   him.


33   "some guy breaking all
34   the windows out of a
35   woman's car."

[Page 292 ]




36   "holy shit."


37   the big kid had his car
38   shot full of holes
39   one night
40   about 6 months back
41   while he
42   slept.


43   the old neighborhood
44   is gone.


45   then a car roars out
46   of that same drive
47   backwards
48   and it goes
49   roaring up to the
50   top of the hill,
51   driving
52   backwards.


53   then it sits at the
54   top of the
55   hill
56   with the motor
57   running and the
58   lights
59   off.


60   the police arrive
61   then,
62   park their car outside
63   of that house,
64   red lights whirling.
65   they are talking to
66   some of the people
67   from the
68   house.


69   then the guy

[Page 293 ]


70   at the top of the
71   hill
72   revs his engine
73   loudly,
74   slams it into gear
75   and roars
76   full speed
77   past the house and
78   down the
79   hill.


80   the cops jump into
81   their car,
82   more screeching,
83   it
84   flashes down
85   the hill
86   after him.


87   "nice to meet you,"
88   I tell the big kid,
89   "my name is
90   Hank."


91   "I'm Eddie."


92   we shake hands.


93   "gotta go, Eddie,
94   calm down my
95   wife ..."


96   "me too, Hank,
97   watch your
98   ass."


99   "you too, baby."


100   I walk up the drive
101   and into the

[Page 294 ]


102   house.


103   "what was it?"
104   she asks.


105   "love gone
106   wrong."


107   "anybody hurt?"


108   "I don't think so,
109   not yet."


110   I sit down on the
111   couch next to
112   her.
113   David Letterman is
114   on.


115   he doesn't know
116   what-the-hell about anything,
117   makes a face into the
118   camera.
119   I get up and go for
120   a bottle of
121   wine.


[Page 295 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  playtime [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   went to a Japanese restaurant with my
2   wife, she ordered tea.
3   I ordered beer in
4   the bottle, told the waiter, "no glass,"
5   and he stood there and asked,
6   "no glass?" and I responded,
7   "that's right."
8   some heads turned.
9   when the beer arrived I
10   lifted it and had a good hit.
11   the waiter came back again
12   and smiled, "no glass?"
13   "thank you," I said, "no glass."
14   then we ordered our meals.
15   when the waiter left my wife
16   said, "please get a glass, Hank."
17   "I prefer it this way," I said.
18   "I'm not going to be able to
19   eat," she said.
20   I lifted the bottle extra high,
21   held it like I was playing a
22   high note on a coronet,
23   had a good hit.
24   "you bastard," my wife
25   said.
26   I smiled.
27   god, I was bad.
28   and it was still only 9 p.m.
29   on a Sunday
30   night.
31   plenty of time to /really/
32   fuck up.
33   I
34   yawned.


[Page 296 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  poem for my 71st birthday [from Bone Palace
        Ballet: New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   yes, I'm still here, doing about what I've always
2   done, although there are some moments of
3   hesitation
4   like I'll be at the plate and the big guy out
5   there will be about ready to fire one in
6   and I'll call time, step outside the batter's
7   box, knock some dirt off my cleats, look
8   around, there are sometimes blinding flashes of
9   light in my eyes
10   but I'll gather myself, shake it off, get back
11   in the box, feel the power returning, I
12   can't wait for the big guy's next pitch and it
13   comes in, a slider, bastard can't fool me,
14   I get the wood on it, it goes out of there,
15   way out of there and I trot the bases
16   as the young guys curse me under their
17   breath; too bad fellows, you see you
18   have to have a feel for it and as long as
19   it's there, you keep going, and when
20   you can't do it anymore, you'll still be
21   asking for one more turn at bat, just to
22   be there, even to swing and miss, it's the
23   doing that gets it done,
24   don't you understand this?


25   like this one here, it's probably only
26   a single or a short hopper to the
27   shortstop,
28   but I've had my swing
29   and I'll be back a few times
30   more,
31   the big guy doesn't have me
32   out of here
33   yet.

        Bukowski, Charles :  slow night [from Bone Palace Ballet: New

1   caught out of focus,
2   time is thin,
3   my slippers are
4   on,
5   the cats are asleep,
6   organ music on
7   the radio,
8   I light a cigar,
9   struggle for a
10   gentle
11   sanity.
12   I have eaten,
13   I have bathed.
14   the bottle is
15   unopened.


16   oh, if the boys
17   could see me
18   now.
19   or if I could see
20   them,
21   the "them" that
22   are left.


23   I will soon sleep,

1   if there were only some help from the
2   other writers, some lift, some gamble,
3   some fire,
4   but they are lax,
5   hang between nowhere and nowhere,
6   it hurts the head and the gut to
7   read them
8   and when I am feeling particularly
9   bad
10   as I am tonight
11   there's no place to go for a
12   boost or a laugh
13   or even a small
14   loan,
15   nothing to do but
16   pour another drink
17   look about the room
18   at anything---
19   a chair, a shoe, a box of
20   toothpicks,
21   I realize that there is
22   only one writer I can go
23   to,
24   he's got to do it for
25   me
26   once again,
27   get that line down
28   brisk and clean
29   to make the snarling women
30   laugh,
31   to make the lion turn in his
32   dream,
33   to make the dead armies
34   flower,
35   to become young again,
36   fresh as a lightning
37   flash,
38   to consume the monster

[Page 301 ]


39   of sorrow,
40   to break horror with
41   just your
42   fingers, to
43   strangle the
44   darkness.


45   now
46   do it
47   do it


48   the gods are laughing
49   already.


[Page 302 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  the joke [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   it often happens when the party is
2   going well,
3   somebody will say, "wait a minute, that
4   reminds me, I heard this
5   joke, it will only take a minute and I
6   promise not to tell
7   more than one."


8   he leans forward and begins to tell
9   it, and this is the worst part because
10   you know it will not be funny, and even worse
11   than that, not even plausible, but he goes
12   on as your stomach feels as if you had
13   eaten a rotten egg, you reach the punch
14   line long before he gets to it, then he
15   finishes,
16   looks about.


17   there is silence, no laughter, not even
18   a smile.


19   "wait," he says, "don't you get it?"


20   "I understand," I tell him.


21   then he leans back, thinks that I
22   have no sense of humor, have had a
23   bad day, or that he has overestimated my
24   intelligence.


25   he could be right on all counts, I know
26   that I often watch famous comedians
27   who make millions tell awful jokes
28   while the audience roars with
29   appreciation and across the nation
30   numberless others join in from their
31   living rooms
32   as I sit there and think, this

[Page 303 ]


33   stuff is bad, very bad, there's
34   little doubt about
35   it.


36   yet some drunk sits in a room
37   with me
38   and is offended because I
39   don't roll on the rug
40   when he lays a

44   but they are never offended
45   enough not to return
46   and toss in a new joke as bad
47   as the first, or worse,
48   returning /to/ the first,
49   having forgotten the previous
50   agony.


51   in all my decades of joke-
52   listening
53   I've only heard one that is
54   worthwhile,
55   it goes like this---
56   no wait, I've forgotten
57   it.


58   you're

        Bukowski, Charles :  Glasgow [from Bone Palace Ballet: New Poems
        (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   do you mean in Scotland? he
2   asked.
3   I'm going to send some poems
4   there, I said.
5   you mean they have magazines
6   there? he asked.
7   yes, I answered,
8   writers and magazines
9   are everywhere, even your mother
10   is a writer and her ass is big and beautiful.
11   now wait a minute, he said.
12   I waited a minute.
13   I can take you, he said.
14   where? I asked.
15   all the way out, he said.
16   there's nothing between us but space,
17   I said, and if you want to close that
18   space, that's up to you.
19   you've got a big mouth, he said.
20   and your mother's got a great ass, I said.
21   why do you keep talking about my mother's ass?
22   he asked.
23   because that's all I see when I see her, I
24   answered.
25   they don't want your stuff in Scotland, he
26   said, they won't like it and I don't like it
27   either.


28   we were sitting at a table at the beach
29   on a windy Tuesday afternoon
30   and drinking green beer.
31   we were both writers but he wasn't as
32   good a writer as I was and it pissed him
33   off.


34   then his mother walked back to our
35   table and then she sat down with us.

[Page 305 ]


36   she had been to the lady's room.


37   Mary, I told her, I'm going to send some
38   poems to Scotland.


39   order me another beer, she said.


40   I got the waiter's eye, he came over
41   and I ordered 3 more beers.


42   Mary spit on the floor and then
43   lit a cigarette.


44   Mary, I said, did anybody tell you
45   that you have beautiful eyes?
46   they glow like beacons in the
47   fog.


48   yeah? she said.


49   Mom, said the other writer, don't
50   believe anything he says.


51   but I do, she said.


52   Mary, I said, you've also got a
53   very beautiful ass.


54   and you've got a face like a
55   hyena, she said.


56   thank you, Mary.


57   it was a windy useless afternoon,
58   the seagulls were starving and
59   angry, they circled,
60   squawking, landing on the
61   sand, picking up uneatable
62   bits and then tossing them away, rising
63   again, flying, terribly beautiful

[Page 306 ]


64   in an unreal sort of way and I
65   had half a chicken sandwich left,
66   I hurled it out the window and
67   the birds went for it, and the sea
68   kept pounding and the fish kept
69   swimming and we sat there with
70   our shoes on and our clothes on
71   and I was a
72   better writer than he but
73   that didn't take much and it didn't
74   really matter.
75   then Mary spilled her beer in her
76   lap,
77   got up and brushed herself off
78   with a napkin
79   and then I saw all that ass
80   again
81   as the waves roared and
82   I sat there with my biggest
83   hard-on since
84   1968.

        Bukowski, Charles :  owl [from Bone Palace Ballet: New Poems
        (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I saw an owl tonight.
2   I saw my first owl tonight.
3   he was sitting high on the phone pole.
4   my wife shined a light upon him.
5   he didn't move.
6   he just sat there
7   illuminated,
8   his eyes shining back.


9   my first owl.
10   my San Pedro owl.


11   then the phone rang.


12   we went inside.
13   it was somebody who wanted to
14   talk.
15   then they were finished.


16   we went outside and the owl
17   was gone.


18   damn the lonely people


19   I may never see an owl
20   again.

1   against the wall, the firing squad ready.
2   then he got a reprieve.
3   suppose they had shot Dostoevsky?
4   before he wrote all that?
5   I suppose it wouldn't have
6   mattered
7   not directly.
8   there are billions of people who have
9   never read him and never
10   will.
11   but as a young man I know that he
12   got me through the factories,
13   past the whores,
14   lifted me high through the night
15   and put me down
16   in a better
17   place.
18   even while in the bar
19   drinking with the other
20   derelicts,
21   I was glad they gave Dostoevsky a
22   reprieve,
23   it gave me one,
24   allowed me to look directly at those
25   rancid faces
26   in my world,
27   death pointing its finger,
28   I held fast,
29   an immaculate drunk
30   sharing the stinking dark with
31   my
32   brothers.

        Bukowski, Charles :  my computer [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   "what?" they say, "you got a
2   /computer/ ?"


3   it's like I have sold out to
4   the enemy.


5   I had no idea so many
6   people were prejudiced
7   against
8   computers.


9   even two editors have
10   written me letters about
11   the computer.


12   one disparaged the
13   computer in a mild and
14   superior way.
15   the other seemed
16   genuinely
17   pissed.


18   I am aware that a
19   computer can't create
20   a poem.
21   but neither can a
22   typewriter.


23   yet, still, once or
24   twice a week
25   I hear:
26   "what?
27   you have a
28   /computer/ ?
29   /you/ ?"


30   yes, I do
31   and I sit up here

[Page 310 ]


32   almost every
33   night,
34   sometimes with
35   beer or
36   wine,
37   sometimes
38   without
39   and I work the
40   computer.
41   the damn thing
42   even corrects
43   my spelling.


44   and the poems
45   come flying
46   out,
47   better than
48   ever.


49   I have no
50   idea what causes
51   all this
52   computer
53   prejudice.


54   me?
55   I want to go
56   the next step
57   beyond the
58   computer.
59   I'm sure it's
60   there.


61   and when I get
62   it,
63   they'll say,
64   "hey, you hear,
65   Chinaski got a
66   /space-biter/ !"

[Page 311 ]




67   "what?"


68   "yes, it's true!"


69   "I can't believe
70   it!"


71   and I'll also have
72   some beer or
73   some wine
74   or maybe nothing
75   at all
76   and I'll be
77   85 years old
78   driving it home
79   to
80   you and me
81   and to the little girl
82   who lost her
83   sheep.
84   or her
85   computer.

        Bukowski, Charles :  thanks to the computer [from Bone Palace
        Ballet: New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   you write a bad poem and you just
2   press the "delete" key and watch the
3   lines vanish as if they had never been,
4   no ripping pages out of the typer,
5   balling them up and tossing them into the
6   wastebasket.


7   the older I get the more I delete.
8   I mean, if I see nothing in a work, what
9   will the reader see?


10   and the computer screen is a tough judge,
11   the words sit and look back at you,
12   with the typewriter you don't see them
13   until you pull out the
14   page.


15   also, the keyboard on a computer is
16   more efficient than that on the
17   typer, with the computer the thoughts
18   leap more quickly from your mind to your
19   fingers, to the screen.


20   is this boring?
21   probably.
22   but I won't delete it because it isn't boring
23   me.


24   I am in love with THIS
25   MACHINE

        Bukowski, Charles :  safe [from Bone Palace Ballet: New Poems
        (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the house next door makes me
2   sad.
3   both man and wife rise early and
4   go to work.
5   they arrive home in early evening.
6   they have a young boy and a girl.
7   by 9 p.m. all the lights in the house
8   are out.
9   the next morning both man and
10   wife rise early again and go to
11   work.
12   they return in early evening.
13   by 9 p.m. all the lights are
14   out.


15   the house next door makes me
16   sad.
17   the people are nice people, I
18   like them.


19   but I feel them drowning.
20   and I can't save them.


21   they are surviving.
22   they are not
23   homeless.


24   but the price is
25   terrible.


26   sometimes during the day
27   I will look at the house
28   and the house will look at
29   me
30   and the house will
31   weep, yes, it does, I
32   feel it.

[Page 314 ]




33   the house is sad for the people living
34   there
35   and I am too
36   and we look at each other
37   and cars go up and down the
38   street,
39   boats cross the harbor
40   and the tall palms poke
41   at the sky
42   and tonight at 9 p.m.
43   the lights will go out,
44   and not only in that
45   house
46   and not only in this
47   city.
48   safe lives hiding,

53   else.

        Bukowski, Charles :  3 blacks [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   it's midway through the card at the
2   track.
3   I am standing at a table,
4   getting my figures ready for the
5   next race.
6   I see them approaching,
7   coming down the
8   aisle.
9   the biggest one is
10   nearest me.
11   as he walks by
12   he gives me a bit of
13   elbow.
14   they keep walking on.
15   then the big one turns,
16   looks back
17   to see how I will react.
18   his face is blank as he
19   looks.
20   mine is blank.
21   he turns and walks on.


22   something about me bothered
23   him:
24   white skin.


25   brother, that's just the way it
26   is.


27   you drive a car?


28   what color is it?


29   don't blame the
30   car.

        Bukowski, Charles :  life like a big tender glove [from Bone
        Palace Ballet: New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   old guy, small, maybe 67 but his hair is
2   pure white, it's the best part of him.
3   he carries coffee in a styrofoam cup.
4   he is moving toward his seat.
5   he is known to his seated compatriots.
6   "what I like about you fellows is you have a
7   sense of humor."
8   "screw you, Eddie," one of them answers.
9   he sits down with them.
10   "anybody here need a wife?"
11   "not yours, Eddie."
12   they are silent then.
13   it's 15 minutes to post time.
14   they study their Racing Forms.
15   all I can see from where I sit is the backs of
16   their necks, their old coats.
17   I don't know why but they remind me of
18   birds on a wire.
19   they are there 5 days a week.
20   God Bless America.
21   I get up and head toward the men's room,
22   thinking,
23   guess my father would have never guessed I'd
24   end up like this:
25   more stolid than the butcher,
26   more placid than a waiting deck of
27   cards,
28   not a button unbuttoned,
29   safe from the salt of the grumbling
30   sun.
31   yea, yea, yea.


[Page 317 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  the old guy in the piano bar [from Bone
        Palace Ballet: New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   doesn't know how bad he is in that
2   white tablecloth place,
3   he's probably a relative of the
4   owner
5   and he sits at the piano and bangs
6   out
7   in the most obvious tired
8   manner
9   Jerome Kern or Scott Joplin
10   or Gershwin
11   and nobody ever applauds or
12   requests a tune,
13   they are into chewing or
14   conversation.


15   I don't feel sorry for him
16   and he doesn't feel sorry
17   for me
18   and part of his job is to
19   greet you when you
20   enter
21   looking up from his
22   keys
23   and to say
24   good night as you
25   exit
26   while still banging at
27   his keys.


28   but I do have a
29   fantasy
30   sometimes while
31   sitting at my table:
32   I see it all:
33   a stranger in a dark
34   overcoat,
35   fedora pulled
36   low over his

[Page 318 ]


37   eyes
38   reaches into the
39   overcoat
40   and out comes a
41   .45
42   and he fires four
43   shots,
44   two into the piano
45   and two into the
46   player.
47   then it is silent.
48   the man rises slowly,
49   walks out and is
50   gone.


51   and the people
52   keep on talking and
53   laughing and drinking
54   and chewing
55   and the waiter walks
56   up and asks me,
57   "is everything all
58   right, sir?"


59   and I answer,
60   "everything is
61   beautiful."


62   "thank you, sir,"
63   he says and
64   walks off
65   as approaching
66   us
67   through the night is
68   the sound of a
69   siren.

        Bukowski, Charles :  nights and years [from Bone Palace Ballet:
        New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the days of hell arrive on schedule,
2   ahead of schedule.
3   and the nights of hell.
4   and the years of hell.


5   hell gnawing away like a rat
6   in your belly.


7   hell inside.
8   hell outside.


9   these poor words,
10   tossed into hell,
11   punched silly, sent
12   running.


13   I walk outside into the
14   night,
15   look up.
16   even the palm trees shriek
17   in agony.


18   the world is being pounded
19   by a senseless
20   force.


21   I go inside, shut the
22   door.


23   at this machine,
24   I write these words for
25   nobody.


26   the sun is dead.
27   the day is dead,
28   the living are dead.


29   only hell lives
30   on.

        Bukowski, Charles :  quiet in a quiet night [from Bone Palace
        Ballet: New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I can feel myself getting fat, old and
2   stupid.
3   I wheeze putting on my shoes.
4   I am no longer sure if I have years
5   left, months left, weeks left,
6   days left
7   or if the last minute is arrowing
8   in.
9   no matter.
10   this bottle of 1983
11   /Saint-Emilion Grand Cru Cassé/
12   still rings the damned gong,
13   at least I've avoided sitting around
14   with the other old farts
15   sorting out unprecious
16   memories
17   the young are no help either,
18   they are shining mirrors without
19   reflection.


20   death sits in the chair across from
21   me and watches.
22   death sees but has no eyes.
23   death knows but has no mind.


24   we often sit together in the night.
25   death has one move left.
26   I have none.


27   this is an excellent wine.
28   it connects me with infinity.
29   a man without wine is like a fish without
30   water,
31   a bird without wings.


32   wine runs in the blood of the tiger
33   and me.

[Page 321 ]




34   death is inferior
35   to this.
36   it can only win an obvious
37   victory.


38   death gets out of the chair and
39   stands behind
40   me.


41   it is a beautiful night.


42   I reach down and pull a long hair
43   from my forearm.
44   I touch it to my cigarette and watch
45   it sizzle away.


46   I am ripe.
47   the trees outside are silent.
48   there is no more,
49   no less.


[Page 322 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  a little cafe on 6th street [from Bone
        Palace Ballet: New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   went in about 1:30 p.m.
2   ordered the turkey sandwich
3   on wheat plus some
4   decaf,
5   opened the paper and
6   waited.


7   two men to my left
8   talking:
9   "well, I wasn't going to
10   /say/ anything but I looked at
11   your haircut and I saw
12   something was
13   wrong ..."


14   "yeah, I was watching her
15   in the mirror and I thought,
16   'hey, what's she doing?'"


17   "I noticed it right
18   away ...


19   you should have said
20   something ..."


21   they went on talking about
22   the haircut and I went on
23   reading.


24   the sandwich and decaf
25   arrived with a side order
26   of
27   slaw and I began
28   eating.


29   "she should have taken more
30   off the /left/ side ..."

[Page 323 ]




31   "yeah, yeah, she's always given
32   me a /good/ cut before ..."


33   "yeah, I mean, it doesn't look
34   /bad/ but somehow it doesn't look
35   /right/ , you
36   know?"


37   "I know ... I might not go
38   back ..."


39   then
40   one of the men
41   asked for some
42   cherry pie:


43   "I really like their
44   cherry pie ..."


45   "me too ...!"


46   I finished my meal
47   left the tip
48   got up and walked to the
49   cash register near the
50   door.


51   the men were into their
52   cherry pies:


53   "I wasn't going to say
54   anything, it's really not a
55   big /thing/ , you know ... but
56   I thought I'd better tell
57   you ..."


58   "oh, I /knew/ ..."


59   "it'll grow out, you'll
60   be all right ..."

[Page 324 ]




61   "when it does, I don't think
62   I'm going back ..."


63   "it's not that bad, it's
64   just ..."


65   I paid and walked outside
66   and my car was there and
67   I got in and drove away
68   but I had to stop for a red
69   light
70   at Pacific
71   and
72   the turkey-on-wheat and
73   the slaw and the
74   decaf
75   huddled and bucked in
76   my stomach


77   and as I got the green light
78   I thought
79   I might not
80   go back there
81   either.

1   I am writing a novel now and one way or
2   the other I have lost 4 chapters in this
3   computer.
4   now like everything else
5   this isn't such an important thing
6   unless it happens to
7   you.


8   like driving the freeway
9   you might see three or four cars
10   crashed and smoking
11   but the effect is only momentary.
12   in a few moments you are thinking
13   about something
14   else.


15   like you'll read this poem and
16   think, too bad, well, he lost 4
17   chapters
18   but couldn't he have written a
19   poem about
20   reaming some whore in a
21   motel room
22   instead?


23   pain seeks each individual
24   separately
25   and that's where hell
26   begins
27   stays
28   festers
29   celebrates
30   its
31   greatness.


32   now.

        Bukowski, Charles :  too hot [from Bone Palace Ballet: New Poems
        (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   I am here courtesy of life,
2   sitting tonight, stiff-necked, weary;
3   95 degrees now
4   the cats will not come in,
5   there is no gunfire in the streets,
6   this whole town is roasting its ass,
7   the devils in Hell are sweaty;
8   there is screwing only in air-
9   conditioned rooms.
10   one a.m.,
11   no sleep, no dreams, and
12   the music from the radio limps
13   through the air.
14   even the dismally lonely forget to
15   phone.
16   that's the only good part of
17   this.
18   oh, there are other decent
19   parts:
20   at least the surgeon's knife is
21   not at work.
22   the flies zoom through the
23   fettered space
24   and there's no need to
25   continue writing this dripping
26   wet poem.
27   right?
28   right.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the last song [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   driving the freeway while
2   listening to the Country and Western boys
3   sing about a broken heart
4   and the honkytonk blues,
5   it seems that things just don't work
6   most of the time
7   and when they do it will be for a
8   short time
9   only.
10   well, that's not news.
11   nothing's news.
12   it's the same old thing in
13   disguise.
14   only one thing comes without a
15   disguise and you only see it
16   once, or
17   maybe never.
18   like getting hit by a freight
19   train.
20   makes us realize that all our
21   moaning about long lost girls
22   in gingham dresses
23   is not so important
24   after
25   all.

1   the cat sprayed in my
2   computer
3   and knocked it
4   out.


5   now I'm back to the
6   old
7   typer.


8   it's
9   tougher.
10   it can handle
11   cat spray, spilled beer
12   and wine,
13   cigarette and
14   cigar ashes,
15   damned near
16   anything.


17   reminds me of
18   myself.


19   welcome back,
20   old boy,
21   from the
22   old boy.

        Bukowski, Charles :  disgusting [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I've got this large plastic floater with headrest
2   and I get onto it
3   and float about the pool
4   looking up at the tall majesty of the trees
5   through the unclear California air
6   I paddle about searching for
7   different views.
8   some of my cats
9   sitting at the edge of the pool,
10   stare,
11   thinking that I have gone
12   crazy.
13   maybe I have.
14   they are used to seeing me
15   sleeping or
16   at the computer
17   they don't mind
18   that.
19   but this?
20   have I turned into a
21   fish?
22   or what?


23   I flip off my floating bed,
24   sink down into the blue
25   pool,
26   rise up,
27   swim to the
28   edge.


29   I climb out,
30   walk toward my
31   towel.


32   dinner soon
33   and the boxing matches on
34   tv,
35   later a bottle of

36   cabernet.


37   it's so nice, this
38   road to
39   hell.

        Bukowski, Charles :  Bach, come back [from Bone Palace Ballet:
        New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   sitting in this old chair, listening to Bach,
2   the music splashes across me, refreshing, delightful.
3   I need it, tonight I feel like a man who has come back
4   from the same old war, death in life,
5   as my guts say not again, not again, to have fought
6   so hard for what?
7   too often, the only escape is sleep.
8   Bach saves me, momentarily.


9   so often I hear my father laughing, the dead laughter
10   of the father who seldom laughed in life
11   is laughing now.
12   then I hear him speak: "You haven't escaped me.
13   I appear in new forms and work at you through
14   them.
15   I'm going to make sure that hell never stops for
16   you."


17   then Bach is back.
18   Bach couldn't you have been my father?
19   nonetheless, you make my hell
20   bearable.


21   I have come back from suicide, the park bench, it was a
22   good fight
23   but my father is still in the world,
24   he gets very close at times
25   and suicide creeps back into my brain,
26   sits there, sits there.


27   as old as I have gotten,
28   there is still now no peace,
29   no place,
30   and it has been months since I,
31   myself, have laughed.


32   now Bach has stopped
33   and I sit in this old chair.

[Page 332 ]


34   old man, old chair.


35   I still have the walls, I still have my
36   death to do.
37   I am alone but not lonely.


38   we all expect more than there
39   is.


40   I sit in undershirt, striped pants, slippers.


41   hell has a head, hell has feet and a mouth,
42   hell has hair and nostrils,
43   hell curves down and encircles me
44   and I think of bridges, windows,
45   buildings, sidewalks,
46   last New Year's Eve,
47   an eyeball in the sand,
48   the dogs, the dogs, running in this
49   room now,
50   eight of them,
51   nine of them,
52   many of them,
53   coming closer and closer,
54   I watch them,
55   I wait,
56   old in my slippers,
57   something cutting through me,
58   the dark night humming and
59   no laughter,
60   no laughter
61   ever
62   again.

1   just lost another poem in this

3   I don't believe it was
4   immortal.
5   neither was this day
6   or night.
7   not when all you
8   can remember
9   is the 4 horse breaking
10   through the gate
11   and spilling the jock
12   in the yellow silks
13   as the man
14   in front of you
15   bit into a hotdog
16   like a mongrel

        Bukowski, Charles :  mailbag [from Bone Palace Ballet: New Poems

1   a schizophrenic
2   in Dallas
3   writes me about his
4   problems:
5   he
6   hears voices,
7   he's
8   hooked on
9   Beckett,
10   also his shrink
11   makes him
12   sit too long
13   in the waiting
14   room.


15   he's supported
16   by his
17   mother
18   and he follows
19   women's
20   softball.


21   also he recently
22   won
23   2nd prize
24   in a chili
25   cook-off.


26   you ought to come
27   to Austin,
28   he writes,
29   you'd love
30   Austin.


31   I file his letter
32   in with the
33   other letters
34   from schizophrenics.

        Bukowski, Charles :  self-invited [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   well, strap my ass on backwards, phone China,
2   run the birds off the wire,
3   buy a painting of a red dove and remember
4   Herbert Hoover.
5   what I am trying to say is that 6 nights out of the
6   last 8 there have been visitors, all self-invited, and
7   like my wife says, "we don't want to hurt their feelings."
8   so we have sat and listened to them, some
9   famous and some not so, some fairly bright
10   and entertaining, some not so
11   but it all ends up as chatter, chatter, chatter, voices,
12   voices, voices, a polite heady whirl of sound and
13   there's a loneliness there: they all want to be accepted
14   in one way or another,
15   they want to be listened to, and that's understandable but
16   I am one of those human beings who would rather sit quietly
17   with my wife and 6 cats (or I like to sit upstairs alone
18   doing nothing).
19   the idea is that I am selfish and that people
20   diminish me; the longer I sit and listen to them
21   the more empty I feel but I don't get
22   the idea that /they/ feel empty, I feel
23   that they enjoy the sound from their
24   mouths.


25   and when they leave almost all make a little gesture
26   toward a future visit.
27   my wife is nice, makes them feel warm as they exit, she's
28   a good soul, so good a soul that when, say, we eat out and
29   choose a table she takes a seat where she can "see the
30   people" and I take a seat where I can't.


31   all right, so I was forged by the devil: all
32   humankind disinterests me and no, it's not fear although
33   certain things about them are fearful, and it's not
34   competition because I don't want
35   anything that they want, it's just that
36   in all those hours of

[Page 337 ]


37   voices voices voices
38   I hear nothing either essentially kind or daring or noble,
39   and not the least bit worth all the time shot through
40   the head.


41   you can remember when you used to run them out into the
42   night instead of letting them wind themselves
43   down,
44   those with their lonely wish for company, and you are
45   ashamed of yourself for putting up with their mostly pure
46   crap
47   but otherwise your wife would say
48   "do you think that you are the only person living on
49   earth?"


50   you see, that's where the devil's got
51   me.


52   so I listen and they are
53   fulfilled.


[Page 338 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  old [from Bone Palace Ballet: New Poems
        (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I see the old men at the racetrack, they are bent, carry
2   canes, their hands tremble, I ride up the escalators with
3   them.
4   we don't speak.
5   I am older than most of them and I wonder why
6   the lights are out for them?
7   do they still hope to win the Pulitzer Prize or to cup the
8   breasts of young maidens in their
9   hands?
10   why don't they just finish and die?
11   I'm ready to go any damned time, I'll even take them
12   with me, 2 or 3 of them, or a half-dozen, a dozen:
13   their wrinkled white skins and their ill-fitting
14   dentures,
15   let them stiffen up and clear the space for clean
16   fresh lightning!
17   what good to linger?
18   for the bedpan last chapter?
19   for the nurse with the television mind, half the weight
20   of her body in flanks and buttocks?


21   why honor the old?
22   it's just the stubbornness of genes, a trick to keep
23   a void existing.
24   almost all have lived lives of obedience and
25   cowardliness.
26   why not honor the young?
27   their lives are just beginning to rot.
28   why honor anybody?
29   but, please, not the old.


30   in the next war the old should fight the old
31   while the young drink and dream and
32   laugh.


33   these old fucks
34   betting two dollars to show
35   at the racetrack.

[Page 339 ]




36   it's like being dead and rolling over
37   in the grave to find a more
38   comfortable
39   position.


[Page 340 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  the young poets [from Bone Palace Ballet:
        New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the young comfortable poets send their work to
2   me,
3   usually 3 or 4 very short
4   poems.
5   some are fairly able,
6   but they lack the
7   texture of madness and
8   gamble,
9   the inventiveness of the
10   wild and the
11   trapped.


12   there is a comfort there
13   which
14   disconcerts.


15   then there is the work
16   of the Street Poets.
17   being on the skids, they
18   should have some
19   life advantages, they
20   should not be debilitated
21   by
22   pretense.
23   but they are full of
24   it.
25   most of their output is
26   about how they are
27   not
28   recognized, that the
29   game is
30   fixed,
31   that they are truly
32   the great
33   ones
34   and they go on
35   about
36   /that/ , while writing

[Page 341 ]


37   little of anything
38   else.


39   each week
40   one or two little
41   packets arrive
42   from either the
43   Street Poets or
44   the comfortable
45   poets.


46   kindness does not
47   work with either
48   group.


49   any response to
50   their work
51   begets more
52   work
53   plus their
54   long letters
55   expounding
56   against the
57   fates
58   as if nobody
59   but themselves
60   ever had to
61   deal with
62   them.


63   and if you fail to
64   respond to
65   /that/ , in most cases,
66   there will be
67   subsequent
68   letters
69   which rail against
70   your
71   inhumanity:
72   you /too/ are

[Page 342 ]


73   against them,
74   and, fuck you,
75   buddy,
76   you've lost
77   it,
78   you never had
79   it,
80   fuck you!


81   I am not an
82   editor.
83   I never mailed my
84   work to anybody
85   but an
86   editor.
87   I never read my
88   work to wives or
89   girlfriends.


90   these poets apparently
91   believe it's all
92   politics, an in-
93   game,
94   that some word
95   from you
96   will enable them
97   to become
98   renowned and
99   famous.
100   and that's what
101   they
102   want.
103   that.
104   and only
105   that.


106   the packets of
107   poems keep
108   arriving.

[Page 343 ]




109   if I were an editor
110   I'd have to
111   reject most of
112   them.


113   but I'm not.


114   I write poems
115   too.


116   and when some of
117   /them/ come back
118   and I reread them
119   I usually feel that
120   they /should/ have
121   come back.


122   what you have to do is
123   dig
124   in,
125   beat that keyboard
126   so that it yells and
127   sings and laughs so
128   hard
129   that the fix gets
130   unfixed, that the god-
131   damned miracle
132   arrives
133   splashed across the
134   paper as you get up
135   and walk across the
136   room, your head
137   buzzing, your heart
138   wanting to fly
139   through the
140   ceiling.
141   it's the best
142   fight, the last
143   fight, the only
144   fight.

        Bukowski, Charles :  Belfast [from Bone Palace Ballet: New Poems

1   writing a letter to Belfast
2   to somebody who reads my
3   books.


4   somehow it seems odd to
5   write a letter to
6   Belfast
7   but everything is odd
8   these days
9   very
10   like writing books
11   or sitting here
12   in striped pants and
13   slippers at
14   12:30 a.m.
15   without even
16   thinking
17   as my young wife is
18   out somewhere
19   enjoying herself
20   as young wives
21   should
22   do.

        Bukowski, Charles :  the dream [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I continually have dreams of being lost, of asking
2   directions
3   but the people I ask have an indefinite way about them, or
4   they act as if they would rather not be bothered
5   but finally one of them will give me confusing
6   and misleading directions.
7   I follow the directions but they lead
8   nowhere: strange hills and curling freeways, and I
9   have no idea where I am.
10   at times I will be walking, at other times I will
11   be driving my car
12   or finally I will lose my car and then I
13   will ask other indefinite and misleading
14   people
15   where is my car?
16   and they will give me vague answers,
17   they won't say, we don't know where your car is, they will
18   pretend that it is not missing or they will refuse to tell me
19   where it is.


20   then I will give up on the car, I want only to return
21   to where I live but the people I ask will give me more
22   unreal directions
23   until I finally give up on them.


24   I walk and walk along, it is always broad daylight, just before
25   noon but as I walk I do not recognize any of my
26   surroundings.
27   the air seems very bright and clear but it also seems
28   somehow false
29   as I walk and walk along.


30   when I awaken I feel much
31   better, of course.
32   I know where I am, here is the bed, the walls,
33   here is my wife in bed next to me.
34   and I think, well, there it was, the same
35   dream.

[Page 346 ]


36   over and over again.


37   I get up and go to the bathroom, look in the mirror,
38   scratch myself, come back out.


39   and then, strangely enough, in a short while the dream is almost
40   forgotten.

1   well, here the computer is down again for
2   the count and I am back with the good old IBM electric.
3   it really doesn't matter as long as I have something
4   to get the word down with.
5   I get physically and mentally ill when I am
6   locked away from the
7   word,
8   and at least the IBM---
9   this machine---doesn't suddenly gulp pages
10   and pages of words
11   that you have celebrated the hours with,
12   words that vanish
13   forever.


14   this machine is slow but safe
15   and I welcome it back like the good friend it still
16   is.


17   I hope that it forgives me
18   and arranges more good luck for me.


19   now it's balking a bit,
20   looking me over.


21   come on baby, I say,
22   do it.
23   do it again.


24   I'm sorry about that whore,
25   you warned me about her
26   but I wouldn't listen.


27   now we're back together.
28   come on, baby,
29   do it
30   again.


31   be a lady

        Bukowski, Charles :  old? [from Bone Palace Ballet: New Poems

1   I'll be 73 in August,
2   almost time to pack my bags for a
3   lark in the dark
4   but there are two things
5   holding me back:
6   I haven't written enough
7   poems yet
8   and there's this
9   old guy who lives in
10   the house next door.
11   he's still there and he's
12   96.
13   he knocks on his window
14   with his cane and
15   blows kisses to my
16   wife.
17   he's totally alert,
18   straight arrow back,
19   quick on his feet,
20   he watches too much
21   tv but don't we
22   all?


23   I visit him sometimes.
24   he talks away,
25   not bad stuff, he sometimes
26   tends to repeat himself
27   but it's almost worth hearing
28   a second time.


29   I was sitting with him one
30   day and he said,
31   "you know, I'm going to
32   kick off soon ..."


33   "well," I said, "I don't know
34   about that."

[Page 350 ]




35   "I do," he said.
36   "now look, would you like
37   to trade for my house?"


38   "well, yeah, it's a nice place."


39   "I don't know if you can give me
40   what I want for it ..."


41   "well, I don't either, try me."


42   "well," he said, "I'll trade for a new
43   set of testicles."


44   when this guy dies there is
45   going to be a great big space
46   that is going to be hard
47   to fill.


48   you know what I
49   mean?

        Bukowski, Charles :  a problem [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   we met for dinner
2   at a place near the
3   harbor.
4   Paul, his wife,
5   Tina.
6   me, my wife,
7   Sarah.


8   we finished
9   dinner.
10   I suggested
11   drinks at our
12   place.


13   they followed
14   our BMW in
15   their
16   Mercedes.


17   with our drinks
18   we got into
19   politics and
20   religion.
21   I looked at
22   Paul and
23   noticed that
24   his face had
25   turned into a
26   cardboard
27   face, his
28   eyes into
29   marbles.


30   then I saw
31   my face
32   in the mirror
33   above the
34   mantle.

[Page 352 ]




35   I had the
36   head of an
37   alligator.


38   I poured
39   more
40   drinks.


41   the conversation
42   turned to the
43   after-life,
44   abortion and
45   the Russians.


46   then somebody
47   told an
48   ethnic
49   joke
50   and the night
51   was over.


52   we walked them
53   to the
54   door.
55   they got into
56   their Mercedes
57   and backed out
58   down the
59   drive.


60   we waved
61   they blinked
62   their
63   lights.


64   we went
65   back
66   inside.


67   "I wonder what

[Page 353 ]


68   they are saying now
69   about
70   us?" I
71   ventured.


72   "what are we
73   going to say
74   about
75   them?" Sarah
76   asked.


77   "nothing," I
78   answered.


79   "did you ever
80   notice?"
81   she asked.


82   "what?"


83   "sometimes you
84   have
85   a head
86   like an
87   alligator."


88   "I've noticed."


89   "we don't have
90   any friends
91   at all,"
92   Sarah
93   said.

        Bukowski, Charles :  taken [from Bone Palace Ballet: New Poems
        (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   Ezra, Celine, Hamsun, Sartre, others
2   got mixed up with that whore
3   Politics
4   and it makes you wonder,
5   was it bad diet?
6   bad liquor?
7   ennui?


8   couldn't they have just motored
9   down the coast and stopped off
10   for a simple lunch?
11   why assume other roles?
12   fools run governments, not every-
13   one can guide the
14   world.


15   centuries don't change men,
16   they only make them seem more
17   foolish.


18   those writers, couldn't they have
19   gone boating?
20   couldn't they have skipped the
21   idiot's trap,
22   the total loss of
23   sense?


24   how could they have done so
25   well
26   and then so
27   badly?


28   why exchange a gift from
29   the gods for a handful of
30   dung?


31   such beautiful men
32   self-castrated

[Page 355 ]


33   as if they couldn't bear
34   their grand luck,
35   retiring to the dumb
36   dark
37   before it reached
38   them.

        Bukowski, Charles :  welcome darkness [from Bone Palace Ballet:
        New Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the door closes and you
2   grin at
3   death.
4   all pretense is gone
5   now.
6   what remains is
7   the similarity of night
8   and morning;
9   the victimization of
10   time and
11   space;
12   the befuddled
13   proclamations;
14   the borrowed
15   assertions;
16   the righteous
17   enactments;
18   the camouflage;
19   a common
20   denominator.


21   the oldest horror
22   show.


23   the murder of the
24   sun.


25   the last of
26   life.

        Bukowski, Charles :  Bach [from Bone Palace Ballet: New Poems
        (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I'm
2   listening to a work of his
3   recorded in
4   1923.
5   I was 3 years old
6   then
7   but Bach was
8   ageless.


9   I am soon going
10   to die
11   but I feel no
12   remorse about
13   this.


14   Bach and I are
15   in this
16   room
17   together.


18   his music now
19   lifts me beyond
20   pain
21   and my
22   pathetic
23   self-
24   interest.


25   Bach, thanks to you,
26   I have no
27   living
28   friends.

        Bukowski, Charles :  great jazz [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   you keep getting an idea
2   that something is going
3   to happen,
4   you can feel it in the
5   edge of your
6   fingernails
7   it's climbing the
8   walls
9   as the jazz group keeps
10   working,
11   going from one chorus to
12   the next,
13   just sliding, rising,
14   it's a sweet hustle,
15   you drink without getting
16   drunk,
17   smoke endless
18   cigarettes at your
19   corner table.
20   the energy keeps
21   building.
22   smoke, drink and
23   listen.
24   the city is here,
25   the world is
26   here.
27   if there's an answer,
28   it's here.
29   god damn.
30   shame to leave
31   even to piss.
32   you hold it.
33   something's going
34   to happen.
35   it's like the 20s in
36   Kansas City.
37   baby, baby, I'm
38   going to stay here

[Page 359 ]


39   forever,
40   they're going to
41   have to slide my
42   bones off this
43   chair,
44   it's happening,
45   it's happening,
46   at
47   last, at last, at
48   last ...

        Bukowski, Charles :  a moment [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   for Wagner the gods of Valhalla also burn in the
2   flames,
3   as here tonight
4   I am sober,
5   my horse won the last race
6   as I was driving in on the freeway;
7   it is the somber time just before
8   midnight,
9   Wagner roaring out of the
10   radio,
11   I have come to pause
12   before the agony and the magic
13   of another man,
14   long dead,
15   he's here with me
16   now,
17   it's frightening and
18   wonderful,
19   then one of my cats walks
20   in,
21   looks at me from the
22   floor
23   with his glorious
24   eyes,
25   he then leaps up on the
26   desk
27   and stands before me,
28   Wagner bouncing
29   off of him
30   and I reach out
31   and touch the
32   cat.


33   impossible.

        Bukowski, Charles :  wondrous [from Bone Palace Ballet: New
        Poems (1997) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   all right, lay on the rain.
2   lay the rain on.
3   lay it on.
4   on the roof.
5   I hear it on the roof.
6   I know that it soothes
7   old wounds and
8   new.
9   then too,
10   one always remembers
11   the times when there
12   was no roof
13   and it
14   rained.
15   one does not forget
16   that.


17   it will rain all this
18   night
19   and we will sleep
20   transfixed by the dark
21   water
22   as our blood runs through
23   our fragile
24   life.


25   lay the rain on.


26   the divine
27   broth.

        Bukowski, Charles :  fact [from Bone Palace Ballet: New Poems

4   last
5   only long
6   enough
7   to
8   die
9   safely.

1   the centerfielder
2   turns
3   rushes back
4   reaches up his glove
5   and
6   snares the
7   ball,
8   we are all him for
9   that moment,
10   sucking the air
11   into our
12   gut.
13   as the crowd roars like
14   crazy
15   we rifle the ball back
16   through the
17   miraculous
18   air.

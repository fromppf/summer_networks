1   poems like gunslingers
2   sit around and
3   shoot holes in my windows
4   chew on my toilet paper
5   read the race results
6   take the phone off the
7   hook.


8   poems like gunslingers
9   ask me
10   what the hell my game is,
11   and
12   would I like to
13   shoot it out?


14   take it easy, I say,
15   the race is not to
16   the swift.


17   the poem sitting at the
18   south end of the couch
19   draws
20   says
21   balls off for that
22   one!


23   take it easy, pardner, I
24   have plans for
25   you.


26   plans, huh? what
27   plans?


28   /The New Yorker,/
29   pard.

30   he puts his iron
31   away.


32   the poem sitting in the
33   chair near the door
34   stretches
35   looks at me:
36   you know, fat boy, you
37   been pretty lazy
38   lately.


39   fuck off
40   I say
41   who's running this
42   game?


43   we're running this
44   game
45   say all the
46   gunslingers
47   drawing iron:
48   get
49   with it!


50   so
51   here you
52   are:


53   this poem
54   was the one
55   who was sitting
56   on top of the
57   refrigerator
58   flipping
59   beercaps.


60   and now
61   I've got him
62   out of the way

[Page 15 ]


63   and all the others
64   are sitting around pointing
65   their weapons at me and
66   saying:


67   I'm next, I'm next, I'm
68   next!


69   I suppose that when
70   I die
71   the leftovers
72   will jump some other
73   poor
74   son of a bitch.

1   I suck on this beer
2   in my kitchen
3   and think about
4   cleaning my fingernails
5   and shaving
6   as I listen to the
7   classical radio
8   station.
9   they play holiday
10   music.
11   I prefer to hear Christmas
12   music in July
13   while I am being threatened
14   with death by
15   a woman.
16   that's
17   when I need it---
18   that's
19   when I need
20   Bing Crosby and the
21   elves and
22   some fast
23   reindeer.


24   now I sit here
25   listening to this
26   slop in
27   season---it's such
28   a sugar tit---
29   I'd rather play a game of
30   ping-pong with
31   the risen ghost
32   of Hitler.


33   amateur drunks run their cheerful
34   cars into each other
35   the ambulances sing to each
36   other outside.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /an ideal/ [from Play the Piano Drunk Like

        (1979) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the Waxmans, she said,
2   he starved,
3   all these builders wanted to
4   buy him;
5   he worked in Paris in London and
6   even in Africa,
7   he had his own
8   concept of
9   design ...


10   what the fuck? I said,
11   a starving architect,
12   eh?


13   yes, yes, he starved /and/ his
14   wife /and/ his children
15   but he was true to
16   his ideals.


17   a starving architect,
18   eh?


19   yes, he finally came through,
20   I saw him and his wife last
21   Wednesday night, the Waxmans ...
22   would you care to meet
23   them?


24   tell him, I said, to stick 3 fingers up
25   his ass
26   and flick-off.


27   you're always so fucking nasty, she said,
28   knocking over her tall-stemmed
29   glass of scotch and
30   water.


31   uh huh, I said, in honor of
32   the dead.

1   there are 4 or 5 guys at the

3   there is a mirror behind the

5   the reflections are not
6   kind


7   of the 4 or 5 guys at the
8   racetrack bar.


9   there are many bottles at the
10   racetrack bar.


11   we order different drinks.


12   there is a mirror behind the
13   bar.


14   the reflections are not
15   kind.


16   "it don't take brains to beat
17   the horses, it just takes money
18   and guts."


19   our reflections are not
20   kind.


21   the clouds are outside.
22   the sun is outside.
23   the horses are warming up outside.


24   we stand at the racetrack
25   bar.

26   "I've been playing the races for
27   40 years and I still can't beat
28   them."


29   "you can play the races for another
30   40 years and you still won't beat
31   them."


32   the bartender doesn't like
33   us.
34   the 5 minute warning buzzer
35   sounds.


36   we finish our drinks and
37   turn away to make our
38   bets.


39   our reflections look better
40   as we walk away:
41   you can't see our
42   faces.


43   4 or 5 guys from the racetrack
44   bar.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /the souls of dead animals/ [from Play the
        Piano Drunk Like a Percussion Instrument Until The Fingers Begin
        To Bleed a Bit (1979) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   after the slaughterhouse
2   there was a bar around the corner
3   and I sat in there
4   and watched the sun go down
5   through the window,
6   a window that overlooked a lot
7   full of tall dry weeds.


8   I never showered with the boys at the
9   plant
10   after work
11   so I smelled of sweat and
12   blood.
13   the smell of sweat lessens after a
14   while
15   but the blood-smell begins to fulminate
16   and gain power.


17   I smoked cigarettes and drank beer
18   until I felt good enough to
19   board the bus
20   with the souls of all those dead
21   animals riding with
22   me;
23   heads would turn slightly
24   women would rise and move away from
25   me.


26   when I got off the bus
27   I only had a block to walk
28   and one stairway up to my
29   room
30   where I'd turn on my radio and
31   light a cigarette
32   and nobody minded me
33   at all.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /another argument/ [from Play the Piano
        Drunk Like a Percussion Instrument Until The Fingers Begin To
        Bleed a Bit (1979) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   she had an uncle who sniffed her
2   panties by
3   firelight while eating
4   crackerjack and
5   muffins with honey,
6   she sat across from me
7   in that Chinese place
8   the drinks kept coming and she
9   talked about Matisse, Iranian
10   coins, fingerbowls at Cambridge, Pound
11   at Salerno, Plato at
12   Madagascar, the death of
13   Schopenhauer, and the times she and
14   I had been together and
15   ebullient.


16   drunk in the afternoon
17   I knew she had kept me too long
18   and when I got back to the /other/
19   she was
20   raving
21   underprivileged
22   pissed and
23   bloody unorthodox burning
24   mad.


25   then she said it didn't matter anymore
26   and I felt like saying
27   what do you mean it doesn't matter anymore?
28   how can you say it about anything, least of
29   all us? where are your eyes and your feet and
30   your head? if the thin blue marching of troops is
31   correct, we are all about to be
32   murdered.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /the red porsche/ [from Play the Piano
        Drunk Like a Percussion Instrument Until The Fingers Begin To
        Bleed a Bit (1979) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   it feels good
2   to be driven about in a red
3   porsche
4   by a woman better-
5   read than I
6   am.
7   it feels good
8   to be driven about in a red
9   porsche
10   by a woman who can explain
11   things about
12   classical
13   music to
14   me.


15   it feels good
16   to be driven about in a red
17   porsche
18   by a woman who buys
19   things for my refrigerator
20   and my
21   kitchen:
22   cherries, plums, lettuce, celery,
23   green onions, brown onions,
24   eggs, muffins, long
25   chilis, brown sugar,
26   Italian seasoning, oregano, white
27   wine vinegar, pompeian olive oil
28   and red
29   radishes.


30   I like being driven about
31   in a red porsche
32   while I smoke cigarettes in
33   gentle languor.

[Page 23 ]




34   I'm lucky. I've always been
35   lucky:
36   even when I was starving to death
37   the bands were playing for
38   me.
39   but the red porsche is very nice
40   and she is
41   too, and
42   I've learned to feel good when
43   I feel good.


44   it's better to be driven around in a
45   red porsche
46   than to own
47   one. the luck of the fool is
48   inviolate.

        Like a Percussion Instrument Until The Fingers Begin To Bleed a
        Bit (1979) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   which reminds me
2   I shacked with Jane for 7 years
3   she was a drunk
4   I loved her


5   my Parents hated her
6   I hated my parents
7   it made a nice
8   foursome


9   one day we went on a picnic
10   together
11   up in the hills
12   and we played cards and drank beer and
13   ate potato salad and weenies


14   they talked to her as if she were a living person
15   at last


16   everybody laughed
17   I didn't laugh.


18   later at my place
19   over the whiskey
20   I said to her,
21   I don't like them
22   but it's good they treated you
23   nice.


24   you damn fool, she said,
25   don't you see?


26   see what?


27   they keep looking at my beer-belly,
28   they think I'm
29   pregnant.

[Page 25 ]




30   oh, I said, well here's to our beautiful
31   child.


32   here's to our beautiful child,
33   she said.


34   we drank them down.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /the drill/ [from Play the Piano Drunk Like
        a Percussion Instrument Until The Fingers Begin To Bleed a Bit
        (1979) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   our marriage book, it
2   says.
3   I look through it.
4   they lasted ten years.
5   they were young once.
6   now I sleep in her bed.
7   he phones her:
8   "I want my drill back.
9   have it ready.
10   I'll pick the children up at
11   ten."
12   when he arrives he waits outside
13   the door.
14   his children leave with
15   him.
16   she comes back to bed
17   and I stretch a leg out
18   place it against hers.
19   I was young once too.
20   human relationships simply aren't
21   durable.
22   I think back to the women in
23   my life.
24   they seem non-existent.


25   "did he get his drill?" I ask.


26   "yes, he got his drill."


27   I wonder if I'll ever have to come
28   back for my bermuda
29   shorts and my record album
30   by /The Academy of St. Martin in the/
31   /Fields/ ? I suppose I
32   will.

1   torn by a temporary wind
2   we come back together again


3   check walls and ceilings for cracks and
4   the eternal spiders


5   wonder if there will be one more
6   woman


7   now
8   40,000 flies running the arms of my
9   soul
10   singing
11   /I met a million dollar baby in a/
12   /5 and 10 cent/
13   /store/


14   arms of my soul?
15   flies?
16   singing?


17   what kind of shit is
18   this?


19   it's so easy to be a poet
20   and so hard to be
21   a man.

        Drunk Like a Percussion Instrument Until The Fingers Begin To
        Bleed a Bit (1979) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I was sitting in a chair
2   in the dark
3   when horrible sounds of torture
4   and fear
5   began in the brush
6   outside of my window.
7   it was obviously not a male cat
8   and a female cat
9   but a male and a male
10   and from the sound
11   one appeared to be much larger
12   and was attacking with the intent to
13   kill.
14   then it stopped.


15   then it began again
16   worse this time;
17   the sounds were so terrible
18   that I was unable to
19   move.


20   then the sounds stopped.


21   I got up from my chair
22   went to bed and
23   slept.


24   I had a dream. this small grey and white
25   cat came to me in my dream
26   and it was very
27   sad. it spoke to me,
28   it said:
29   "look what the other cat did to me."
30   and it rested in my lap
31   and I saw the slashes and

[Page 29 ]


32   the raw flesh. then it
33   jumped off my lap.


34   then that was all.


35   I awakened at 8:45 p.m.
36   put on my clothes and walked outside
37   and looked around.


38   there was nothing
39   there.


40   I walked back inside and
41   dropped two eggs
42   into a pot of water
43   and turned up the
44   flame.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /the paper on the floor/ [from Play the
        Piano Drunk Like a Percussion Instrument Until The Fingers Begin
        To Bleed a Bit (1979) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   ... the drawing is poor and I know little of the plot:
2   a man with a stable, world-earned face and the necktie of
3   respectability, and a satisfied pipe; and his wife---
4   signified by the quick ink of black hair (just ever so
5   tousled with having /babies/ and guiding them safely through
6   the falls): there is a grandmother who sits somewhat like
7   a flowerpot: allotted an earned space but not really
8   /useful/ ; and a couple of smiling, knee-climbing gamins
9   two little Jung and Adlers
10   full of moot, black-type questions,
11   and, of course,
12   a young girl troubled with young loves
13   (they take these things so much more /seriously/ than the
14   young men who
15   go behind the barn);
16   and there /is/ a young man---her, I presume barn-wise, brother
17   with this great tundra, this /shield/ of black hair;
18   he is horribly healthy
19   and dressed in the latest in sport shirts
20   in the best barn-wise manner;
21   this big ... brother (16? 17? 18? God wot?)
22   is usually (when I read this, which is not very often)
23   leaning forward over the car seat
24   (he sits in the back, like the author)
25   and makes some ... comment on LIFE, capital all-the-way LIFE
26   that is so VERY true
27   that it just ... upsets /every/ body
28   except the poor kiddies who don't know what the hell it's
29   all about in spite of their Jung and Adler
30   and they just ride along round-eyed and sucking at their
31   lollypops all up in the pretty pure white clouds;
32   but, lo, the headman grinds his pipe grey-faced against this
33   sporty truth that old men let lie like overgrown
34   gas-meter covers; and the mother (wife wot?) draws down
35   a long black eyebrow and one more strand of hair becomes
36   unattached in the cool long struggle; and

[Page 31 ]


37   Grandma, oh, I don't know---
38   by then I have looked away; but I remember the girl,
39   the young girl with young loves
40   is always /especially/ angry
41   because the back of the barn has been blamed on her ...
42   locked with René the Frenchman, the struggling ... painter or
43   wot?
44   nobody wants to face it but this ... fat ... sports-wear shirt
45   character (who is /really/ a nice strong boy who will really
46   be O.K. some day) keeps bringing the cow out from behind the
47   barn
48   with the bull; but he is young
49   and laughs
50   and all somehow bear up;
51   but best is his ... /explanation/ of it all,
52   of the cow and the bull,
53   with the inherent and instinctive ... wiseness of his
54   youth;
55   the /explanation/ usually comes in the morning
56   over the breakfast table---
57   before all this sickly struggling ordinary mess of common ...
58   humanity has had a chance
59   to seat itself
60   the healthy white ... face laughs and tells it all;
61   he's been sitting there waiting to tell it all,
62   he's been sitting there with the little ... twins (or wot?)
63   as they spill porridge so cutely with their little spoons,
64   this big ... happy oaf who's never had a toothache
65   has been sitting waiting the entrance of his elders
66   (Granny who must put in her teeth, and Papa who is worried
67   about the office, and Mama who isn't exactly straightened out
68   yet; and the young girl who loves with faith, anger and ...
69   purity) in they come
70   and he /throws/ out an arm
71   and tilting his healthy ... carcass madly back in the chair
72   before the sun-pure kitchen curtains
73   and the little lovable, struggling bungling group
74   he says his great say,
75   and in the balloon above his head are the words

[Page 32 ]


76   and by the twisted agony of the faces
77   I am led to believe /something/ has been said,
78   but I read again
79   looking carefully at the great happy spewing oaf's face
80   the brown great deepness of the eyes
81   and the young girl's teeth pushed out sour as if she had
82   bitten into some lemon of truth,
83   but there is something wrong
84   there is some mistake
85   because the sheet of paper I hold
86   slants and angles in the electric light
87   into the open dizziness of my dome
88   and it huddles and curls itself into a puffy knot
89   and pushes at the back of my eyes
90   and pulls my nerves taut-thin from toe to hair-line
91   and I know then that
92   the great spewing oaf has said
93   nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing
94   nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing
95   nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing
96   and now,
97   on the rug
98   under the chair
99   I can see the comic section
100   folded in half,
101   I can see the black and white lines
102   and some faces I don't care to discern;
103   but a thin illness overcomes me
104   at the sight of this portion of paper
105   and I look away
106   and try not to think
107   that much of our living life
108   is true to the little paper faces
109   that stare up from our feet
110   and grin and jump and gesture,
111   to be wrapped in tomorrow's garbage
112   and thrown away.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /2 flies/ [from Play the Piano Drunk Like a
        Percussion Instrument Until The Fingers Begin To Bleed a Bit
        (1979) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   The flies are angry bits of
2   life;
3   why are they so angry?
4   it seems they want more,
5   it seems almost as if they
6   are angry
7   that they are flies;
8   it is not my fault;
9   I sit in the room
10   with them
11   and they taunt me
12   with their agony;
13   it is as if they were
14   loose chunks of soul
15   left out of somewhere;
16   I try to read a paper
17   but they will not let me
18   be;
19   one seems to go in half-circles
20   high along the wall,
21   throwing a miserable sound
22   upon my head;
23   the other one, the smaller one
24   stays near and teases my hand,
25   saying nothing,
26   rising, dropping
27   crawling near;
28   what god puts these
29   lost things upon me?
30   other men suffer dictates of
31   empire, tragic love ...
32   I suffer
33   insects ...
34   I wave at the little one
35   which only seems to revive
36   his impulse to challenge:

[Page 34 ]


37   he circles swifter,
38   nearer, even making
39   a fly-sound,
40   and one above
41   catching a sense of the new
42   whirling, he too, in excitement,
43   speeds his flight,
44   drops down suddenly
45   in a cuff of noise
46   and they join
47   in circling my hand,
48   strumming the base
49   of the lampshade
50   until some man-thing
51   in me
52   will take no more
53   /unholiness/
54   and I strike
55   with the rolled-up paper---
56   missing!---
57   striking,
58   striking,
59   they break in discord,
60   some message lost between them,
61   and I get the big one
62   first, and he kicks on his back
63   flicking his legs
64   like an angry whore,
65   and I come down again
66   with my paper club
67   and he is a smear
68   of fly-ugliness;
69   the little one circles high
70   now, quiet and swift,
71   almost invisible;
72   he does not come near
73   my hand again;
74   he is tamed and
75   inaccessible; I leave

[Page 35 ]


76   him be, he leaves me
77   be;
78   the paper, of course,
79   is ruined;
80   something has happened,
81   something has soiled my
82   day,
83   sometimes it does not
84   take a man
85   or a woman,
86   only something alive;
87   I sit and watch
88   the small one;
89   we are woven together
90   in the air
91   and the living;
92   it is late
93   for both of us.

        Fingers Begin To Bleed a Bit (1979) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   of course it is nonsense to try to patch up an
2   old poem while drinking a warm beer
3   on a Sunday afternoon; it is better to simply
4   exist through the end of a cigarette;
5   the people are listless and although this is a
6   poor term of description
7   Gershwin is on the radio
8   banging and praying to get out;
9   I have read the newspapers,
10   carefully noting the suicides,
11   I have also carefully noted
12   the green of some tree
13   like a nature poet on his last cup,
14   and
15   bang bang
16   there they go outside;
17   new children, some of them getting ready
18   to sit here, and do as I am doing---
19   warm beer, dead Gershwin,
20   getting fat around the middle,
21   disbelieving the starving years,
22   Atlanta frozen like God's head
23   holding an apple in the window,
24   but we are all finally tricked and
25   slapped to death
26   like lovers' vows, bargained
27   out of any gain,
28   and the radio is finished
29   and the phone rings and a female says,
30   "I am free tonight;" well, she is not much
31   but I am not much either;
32   in adolescent fire I once thought I could ride
33   a horse through the streets of anywhere,
34   but they quickly shot this horse from under,
35   "Ya got cigarettes?" she asks. "Yes," I say,
36   "I got cigarettes." "Matches?" she asks.

[Page 37 ]




37   "Enough matches to burn Rome." "Whiskey?"
38   "Enough whiskey for a Mississippi River
39   of pain." "You drunk?" "Not yet."
40   She'll be over: perfect: a fig
41   leaf and a small club, and
42   I look at the poem I am trying to work with:


43   /I say that/
44   /the backalleys will arrive upon/
45   /the bloodyapes/
46   /as noon arrives upon the Salinas/
47   /fieldhands/ ....


48   bullshit. I rip the page once, twice,
49   three times, then check for matches and
50   icecubes, hot and cold,
51   with some men their conversation is better than
52   their creation
53   and with other men
54   it's a woman
55   almost any woman
56   that is their Rodin among park benches;
57   bird down in road awaiting rats and wheels
58   I know that I have deserted you,
59   the icecubes pile like fool's gold
60   in the pitcher
61   and now they are playing
62   Alex Scriabin
63   which is a little better
64   but not much
65   for me.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /fire station/ [from Play the Piano Drunk
        Like a Percussion Instrument Until The Fingers Begin To Bleed a
        Bit (1979) , Black Sparrow Press ]


/(For Jane, with love)/



1   we came out of the bar
2   because we were out of money
3   but we had a couple of wine bottles
4   in the room.


5   it was about 4 in the afternoon
6   and we passed a fire station
7   and she started to go
8   crazy:


9   "a FIRE STATION! oh, I just love
10   FIRE engines, they're so red and
11   all! let's go in !"


12   I followed her on
13   in. "FIRE ENGINES!" she screamed
14   wobbling her big
15   ass.


16   she was already trying to climb into
17   one, pulling her skirt up to her
18   waist, trying to jacknife up into the
19   seat.


20   "here, here, lemme help ya!" a fireman ran
21   up.


22   another fireman walked up to
23   me: "our citizens are always welcome,"
24   he told
25   me.


26   the other guy was up in the seat with
27   her. "you got one of those big THINGS?"

[Page 39 ]




28   she asked him. "oh, hahaha!, I mean one of
29   those big HELMETS!"


30   "I've got a big helmet too," he told
31   her.


32   "oh, hahaha!"


33   "you play cards?" I asked /my/
34   fireman. I had 43 cents and nothing but
35   time.


36   "come on in back," he
37   said. "of course, we don't gamble.
38   it's against the
39   rules."


40   "I understand," I told
41   him.


42   I had run my 43 cents up to a
43   dollar ninety
44   when I saw her going upstairs with
45   /her/ fireman.


46   "he's gonna show me their sleeping
47   quarters," she told
48   me.


49   "I understand," I told
50   her.


51   when her fireman slid down the pole
52   ten minutes later
53   I nodded him
54   over.


55   "that'll be 5
56   dollars."

[Page 40 ]




57   "5 dollars for
58   that?"


59   "we wouldn't want a scandal, would
60   we? we both might lose our
61   jobs. of course, I'm not
62   working."


63   he gave me the
64   5.


65   "sit down, you might get it
66   back."


67   "whatcha playing?"
68   "blackjack."


69   "gambling's against the
70   law."


71   "anything interesting is. besides,
72   you see any money on the
73   table?"
74   he sat down.


75   that made 5 of
76   us.


77   "how was it Harry?" somebody asked
78   him.


79   "not bad, not
80   bad."


81   the other guy went on
82   upstairs.


83   they were bad players really.
84   they didn't bother to memorize the

[Page 41 ]


85   deck. they didn't know whether the
86   high numbers or low numbers were left. and basically they hit too
87   high,
88   didn't hold low
89   enough.


90   when the other guy came down
91   he gave me a
92   five.


93   "how was it, Marty?"
94   "not bad. she's got ... some fine
95   movements."


96   "hit me!" I said. "nice clean girl. I
97   ride it myself."


98   nobody said
99   anything.


100   "any big fires lately?" I
101   asked.


102   "naw. nothin'
103   much."


104   "you guys need
105   exercise. hit me
106   again!"


107   a big red-headed kid who had been shining an
108   engine
109   threw down his rag and
110   went upstairs.


111   when he came down he threw me a
112   five.

[Page 42 ]




113   when the 4th guy came down I gave him
114   3 fives for a
115   twenty.


116   I don't know how many firemen
117   were in the building or where they
118   were. I figured a few had slipped by me
119   but I was a good
120   sport.


121   it was getting dark outside
122   when the alarm
123   rang.


124   they started running around.
125   guys came sliding down the
126   pole.


127   then she came sliding down the
128   pole. she was good with the
129   pole. a real woman. nothing but guts
130   and
131   ass.


132   "let's go," I told
133   her.


134   she stood there waving goodbye to the
135   firemen but they didn't seem
136   much interested
137   any more.


138   "let's go back to the
139   bar," I told
140   her.


141   "ooh, you got
142   money?"

[Page 43 ]




143   "I found some I didn't know I
144   had ..."


145   we sat at the end of the bar
146   with whiskey and beer
147   chaser.
148   "I sure got a good
149   sleep."


150   "sure, baby, you need your
151   sleep."


152   "look at that sailor looking at me!
153   he must think I'm a ... a ..."


154   "naw, he don't think that. relax, you've got
155   class, real class. sometimes you remind me of an
156   opera singer. you know, one of those prima d's.
157   your class shows all over
158   you. drink
159   up."


160   I ordered 2
161   more.


162   "you know, daddy, you're the only man I
163   LOVE! I mean, really ... LOVE! ya
164   know?"


165   "sure I know. sometimes I think I am a king
166   in spite of myself."


167   "yeah. yeah. /that's/ what I mean, somethin' like
168   that."


169   I had to go to the urinal. when I came back
170   the sailor was sitting in my
171   seat. she had her leg up against his and
172   he was talking.

[Page 44 ]




173   I walked over and got in a dart game with
174   Harry the Horse and the corner
175   newsboy.

        the Piano Drunk Like a Percussion Instrument Until The Fingers
        Begin To Bleed a Bit (1979) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   Foch was a great soldier, he said, Marshal Foch;
2   listen, I said, if you don't keep it clean
3   I'll have to slap you across the face with
4   a wet towel.


5   I'll write the governor, he said.
6   the governor is my uncle, I said.


7   Marshal Foch was my
8   grandfather, he said.


9   I warned you, I said. I'm a
10   gentleman.


11   And I'm a Foch, he said.
12   that did it. I slapped him with a wet towel.


13   he grabbed the phone.
14   governor's mansion, he said.


15   I slapped a wet rubber glove down
16   his mouth and cut the wire.


17   outside the crickets were chirping like
18   mad: Foch, Foch, Foch, Foch!
19   they chirped.


20   I got out my sub-machine gun and blasted
21   the devils
22   but there were so many of them
23   I had to give up.


24   I pulled the wet rubber glove out.
25   I surrender, I said, it's too much:
26   I can't change the world.

[Page 46 ]




27   all the so-called ladies in the room
28   applauded.


29   he stood up and bowed gallantly as
30   outside the crickets chirped.


31   I put on my hat
32   and stalked out. I still maintain
33   the French are weak
34   and no
35   wonder.

1   I smoked 2 packs of cigarettes today and
2   my tongue feels like a
3   caterpillar trying to get out for
4   rainwater
5   somebody is working over
6   Pictures at an Exhibition
7   while tiny pimples of sweat
8   work their way down my
9   fat sides.
10   too sick today and told the man
11   over the phone
12   it was stomach pains.
13   the pains in the ass too and
14   the soul?
15   the gophers are underground
16   staring at pictures on mudwalls
17   machineguns are mounted in the
18   windows.
19   40 cigarettes.

29   while? your body in a donkey's
30   body? you'd only last
31   ten minutes
32   they'd have to let you
33   out
34   you'd be so
35   scared
36   but who's going to

[Page 48 ]


37   let you out of that
38   dismal bluepurple notion
39   of what you are
40   now? and I'm the one who's
41   scared.

1   he was a good one
2   say 18, 19,
3   a marine
4   and everytime
5   a woman came down the train aisle
6   he seemed to stand up
7   so I couldn't see
8   her
9   and the woman smiled at him


10   but I didn't smile
11   at him


12   he kept looking at himself in the
13   train window
14   and standing up and taking off his
15   coat and then standing up
16   and putting it back
17   on


18   he polished his belt buckle with a
19   delighted vigor


20   and his neck was red and
21   his face was red and his eyes were a
22   pretty blue


23   but I didn't like
24   him


25   and everytime I went to the can
26   he was either in one of the cans
27   or he was in front of one of the mirrors
28   combing his hair or
29   shaving

[Page 50 ]


30   and he was always walking up and down the
31   aisles
32   or drinking water
33   I watched his Adam's apple juggle the water
34   down


35   he was always in my
36   eyes


37   but we never spoke
38   and I remembered all the other trains
39   all the other buses
40   all the other wars


41   he got off at Pasadena
42   vainer than any woman
43   he got off at Pasadena
44   proud and
45   dead


46   the rest of the trainride---
47   8 or 10 miles---
48   was perfect.

1   I opened the door of this shanty and there she lay
2   there she lay
3   my love
4   across the back of a man in a dirty undershirt.
5   I was rough tough easy-with-money-Charley (that's me)
6   and I awakened both of them
7   like God
8   and when she was awake
9   she started screaming, "Hank, Hank!" (that's my other name)
10   "take me away from this son of a bitch!
11   I hate him I love you!"


12   of course, I was wise enough not to believe any of
13   this and I sat down and said,
14   "I need a drink, my head hurts and I need a
15   drink."


16   this is the way love works, you see, and then we all sat there
17   drinking the whiskey and I was
18   perfectly satisfied
19   and then he reached over and handed me a five,
20   "that's all that's left of what she took, that's all that's left
21   of what she took from you."


22   I was no golden-winged angel ripped up through
23   boxtops
24   I took the five and left them in there
25   and I walked up the alley
26   to Alvarado street
27   and I turned in left
28   at the first
29   bar.

1   o, just give me a little atomic bomb
2   not too much
3   just a little
4   enough to kill a horse in the street
5   but there aren't any horses in the street


6   well, enough to knock the flowers from a bowl
7   but I don't see any
8   flowers in a
9   bowl


10   enough then
11   to frighten my love
12   but I don't have any

14   well
15   give me an atomic bomb then
16   to scrub in my bathtub

19   just a little atomic bomb, general,
20   with pugnose

1   he's 17.
2   mother, he said, how do I crack an
3   egg?


4   all right, she said to me, you don't have to
5   sit there looking like that.


6   oh, mother, he said, you broke the yoke.
7   I can't eat a broken yoke.


8   all right, she said to me, you're so tough,
9   you've been in the slaughterhouses, factories,
10   the jails, you're so god damned tough,
11   but all people don't have to be like you,
12   that doesn't make everybody else wrong and you
13   right.


14   mother, he said, can you bring me some cokes
15   when you come home from work?


16   look, Raleigh, she said, can't you get the cokes
17   on your bike, I'm tired after
18   work.


19   but, mama, there's a hill.


20   what hill, Raleigh?


21   there's a hill,
22   it's there and I have to peddle over
23   it.


24   all right, she said to me, you think you're so
25   god damned tough. you worked on a railroad track
26   gang, I hear about it every time you get drunk:
27   "I worked on a railroad track gang."

[Page 54 ]




28   well, I said, I did.


29   I mean, what difference does it make?
30   everybody has to work somewhere.


31   mama, said the kid, will you bring me those
32   cokes?


33   I really like the kid. I think he's very
34   gentle. and once he learns how to crack an
35   egg he may do some
36   unusual things. meanwhile
37   I sleep with his mother
38   and try to stay out of
39   arguments.

1   you knifed me, he said, you told /Pink Eagle/
2   not to publish me.
3   oh hell, Manny, I said, get off it.


4   these poets are very sensitive
5   they have more sensitivity than talent,
6   I don't know what to do with them.


7   just tonight the phone rang and
8   it was Bagatelli and Bagatelli said
9   Clarsten phoned and Clarsten was pissed
10   because we hadn't mailed him the
11   anthology, and Clarsten blamed me
12   for not mailing the anthology
13   and furthermore Clarsten
14   claimed I was trying to do him
15   in, and he was very
16   angry. so said
17   Bagatelli.


18   you know, I'm really beginning to feel like
19   a literary power
20   I just lean back in my chair and roll cigarettes
21   and stare at the walls
22   and I am given credit for the life and death of
23   poetic careers.
24   at least I'm given credit for the
25   death part.


26   actually these boys are dying off without my
27   help. The sun has gone behind the cloud.
28   I have nothing to do with the workings.
29   I smoke Prince Albert, drink Schlitz
30   and copulate whenever possible. believe in my
31   innocence and I might consider
32   yours.

1   the ladies of summer will die like the rose
2   and the lie


3   the ladies of summer will love
4   so long as the price is not
5   forever


6   the ladies of summer
7   might love anybody;
8   they might even love you
9   as long as summer
10   lasts


11   yet winter will come to them
12   too


13   white snow and
14   a cold freezing
15   and faces so ugly
16   that even death
17   will turn away---
18   wince---
19   before taking
20   them.

1   she's young, she said,
2   but look at me,
3   I have pretty ankles,
4   and look at my wrists, I have pretty
5   wrists
6   o my god,
7   I thought it was all working,
8   and now it's her again,
9   every time she phones you go crazy,
10   you told me it was over
11   you told me it was finished,
12   listen, I've lived long enough to become a
13   good woman,
14   why do you need a bad woman?
15   you need to be tortured, don't you?
16   you think life is rotten if somebody treats you
17   rotten it all fits,
18   doesn't it?
19   tell me, is that it? do you want to be treated like a
20   piece of shit?
21   and my son, my son was going to meet you.
22   I told my son
23   and I dropped all my lovers.
24   I stood up in a cafe and screamed
25   I'M IN LOVE,
26   and now you've made a fool of me ...


27   I'm sorry, I said, I'm really sorry.


28   hold me, she said, will you please hold me?


29   I've never been in one of these things before, I said,
30   these triangles ...


31   she got up and lit a cigarette, she was trembling all
32   over. she paced up and down, wild and crazy. she had

[Page 58 ]


33   a small body. her arms were thin, very thin and when
34   she screamed and started beating me I held her
35   wrists and then I got it through the eyes: hatred,
36   centuries deep and true. I was wrong and graceless and
37   sick. all the things I had learned had been wasted.
38   there was no living creature as foul as I
39   and all my poems were
40   false.

        (1979) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   this is not just an apple
2   this is an experience
3   red green yellow
4   with underlying pits of white
5   wet with cold water
6   I bite into it
7   christ, a white doorway ...


8   another bite
9   chewing
10   while thinking of an old witch
11   choking to death on an apple skin---
12   a childhood story.


13   I bite deeply
14   chew and swallow


15   there is a feeling of waterfalls
16   and endlessness


17   there is a mixture of electricity and
18   hope.


19   yet now
20   halfway through the apple
21   some depressive feelings begin


22   it's ending
23   I'm working toward the core
24   afraid of seeds and stems


25   there's a funeral march beginning in Venice,
26   a dark old man has died after a lifetime of pain


27   I throw away the apple early
28   as a girl in a white dress walks by my window

[Page 60 ]




29   followed by a boy half her size
30   in blue pants and striped
31   shirt


32   I leave off a small belch
33   and stare at a dirty
34   ashtray.

1   he was in the upper grandstand
2   at the end
3   where they made their stretch moves
4   after coming off the curve.


5   he was a small man
6   pink, bald, fat
7   in his 60's.


8   he was playing a violin
9   he was playing classical music on
10   his violin
11   and the horseplayers ignored him.


12   Banker Agent won the first race
13   and he played his violin.


14   Can Fly won the 3rd race and
15   he continued to play his violin.


16   I went to get a coffee and when I came back
17   he was still playing, and he was still playing
18   after Boomerang won the 4th.


19   nobody stopped him
20   nobody asked him what he was doing
21   nobody applauded.


22   after Pawee won the 5th
23   he continued
24   the music falling over the edge of the
25   grandstand and into the
26   wind and sun.


27   Stars and Stripes won the 6th
28   and he played some more

[Page 62 ]


29   and Staunch Hope got up on the inside
30   to take the 7th
31   and the violin player worked away
32   and when Lucky Mike won at 4 to 5 in the 8th
33   he was still making music.


34   after Dumpty's Goddess took the last
35   and they began their long slow walk to their cars
36   beaten and broke again
37   the violin player continued
38   sending his music after them
39   and I sat there listening
40   we were both alone up there and
41   when he finished I applauded.
42   the violin player stood up
43   faced me and bowed.
44   then he put his fiddle in the case
45   got up and walked down the stairway.


46   I allowed him a few minutes
47   and then I got up
48   and began the long slow walk to my car.
49   it was getting into evening.

        a Percussion Instrument Until The Fingers Begin To Bleed a Bit
        (1979) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I am dying of sadness and alcohol
2   he said to me over the bottle
3   on a soft Thursday afternoon
4   in an old hotel room by the train depot.


5   I have, he went on, betrayed myself with
6   belief, deluded myself with love
7   tricked myself with sex.


8   the bottle is damned faithful, he said,
9   the bottle will not lie.


10   meat is cut as roses are cut
11   men die as dogs die
12   love dies like dogs die,
13   he said.


14   listen, Ronny, I said,
15   lend me 5 dollars.


16   love needs too much help, he said.
17   hate takes care of itself.


18   just 5 dollars, Ronny.


19   hate contains truth. beauty is a facade.


20   I'll pay you back in a week.


21   stick with the thorn
22   stick with the bottle
23   stick with the voices of old men in hotel rooms.


24   I ain't had a decent meal, Ronny, for a
25   couple of days.

[Page 64 ]




26   stick with the laughter and horror of death.
27   keep the butterfat out.
28   get lean, get ready.


29   something in my gut, Ronny, I'll be able
30   to face it.


31   to die alone and ready and unsurprised,
32   that's the trick.


33   Ronny, listen---


34   that majestic weeping you hear
35   will not be for
36   us.


37   I suppose not, Ronny.


38   the lies of centuries, the lies of love,
39   the lies of Socrates and Blake and Christ
40   will be your bedmates and tombstones
41   in a death that will never end.


42   Ronny, my poems came back from the
43   /New York Quarterly./


44   that is why they weep,
45   without knowing.


46   is that what all that noise is, I said,
47   my god shit.

1   she means well.
2   play the piano
3   she says
4   it's not good for you
5   not to write.


6   she's going for a walk
7   on the island
8   or a boatride.
9   I believe she's taken a modern novel
10   and her reading glasses.


11   I sit at the window
12   with her electric typewriter
13   and watch young girls' asses
14   which are attached to
15   young girls.


16   the final decadence.


17   I have 20 published books
18   and 6 cans of beer.


19   the tourists bob up and down in the water
20   the tourists walk and talk and take
21   photographs and
22   drink soft drinks.


23   it's not good for me not to
24   write.
25   she's in a boat now, a
26   sightseeing tour
27   and she's thinking, looking
28   at the waves---
29   "it's 2:30 p.m.
30   he must be writing

[Page 66 ]


31   it's not good for him not to write.
32   tonight there will be other things to do.
33   I hope he doesn't drink
34   too much beer. he's a much better
35   lover than Robert was
36   and the sea is beautiful."

        Begin To Bleed a Bit (1979) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   the night I was going to die
2   I was sweating on the bed
3   and I could hear the crickets
4   and there was a cat fight outside
5   and I could feel my soul dropping down through the
6   mattress
7   and just before it hit the floor I jumped up
8   I was almost too weak to walk
9   but I walked around and turned on all the lights
10   then made it back to the bed
11   and again my soul dropped down through the mattress
12   and I leaped up
13   just before it hit the floor
14   I walked around and I turned on all the lights
15   and then I went back to bed
16   and down it dropped again and
17   I was up
18   turning on all the lights


19   I had a 7 year old daughter
20   and I felt sure she didn't want me dead
21   otherwise it wouldn't have
22   mattered


23   but all that night
24   nobody phoned
25   nobody came by with a beer
26   my girlfriend didn't phone
27   all I could hear were the crickets and it was
28   hot
29   and I kept working at it
30   getting up and down
31   until the first of the sun came through the window
32   through the bushes
33   and then I got on the bed
34   and the soul stayed

[Page 68 ]


35   inside at last and
36   I slept.
37   now people come by
38   eating on the doors and windows
39   the phone rings
40   the phone rings again and again
41   I get great letters in the mail
42   hate letters and love letters.
43   everything is the same again.

1   there's this blue baby and she's sucking a
2   blue breast under a green vine that has
3   grown from the ceiling,
4   and further to the right
5   there's a light brown girl
6   against a dark brown background
7   and she's leaning out over a chair looking
8   pensive, I suppose.
9   my cigarette just went out
10   there are never any matches around here
11   and I get up and go into the kitchen
12   and light it on a 30 year old stove.
13   I get back without accident.
14   now behind me on a pink chair
15   is a large old-fashioned shears.
16   it is 15 minutes past midnight
17   and the hook is on the door
18   and over the tall twisted lamp by the bed
19   is a red floppy hat that is used as a lampshade
20   and a small dog growls at the tall cold sky outside.
21   there are two mattresses on the floor
22   and I have slept on one of those mattresses
23   many nights.
24   they say they are going to bulldoze this place
25   which is owned by a Japanese wrestler called Fuji.
26   I don't see how it can be replaced with anything better.


27   she fixed the bathtub faucet and the faucet in the sink
28   tonight. she can't roll a cigarette but she keeps the
29   plumbing bills down.
30   we ate some Col. Sanders chicken with coleslaw, mashed spuds,
31   gravy and biscuits.
32   it's 23 minutes past midnight
33   and they are going to bulldoze this place,
34   I don't mean tomorrow, I mean soon,
35   and the small dog growls at the sky again

[Page 70 ]


36   and my cigarette is out again;
37   the love on that one mattress near the door,
38   the sex and the arguments and the dreams and the
39   conversations,
40   that bulldozer is going to come up missing there,
41   and even when it knocks down the trees and the crapper
42   and eats holes in the dirt driveway
43   it's not going to get it all,
44   and when I drive by in 6 months and see the highrise
45   filled with 50 people with good stable incomes,
46   I will still remember the blue baby sucking the blue breast,
47   the vine through the roof, the brown girl,
48   the leaky faucets, the spiders and the termites,
49   the grey and yellow paint, the tablecloth over the front
50   window, and that mattress near the door.

        Drunk Like a Percussion Instrument Until The Fingers Begin To
        Bleed a Bit (1979) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   it was on the 2nd floor on Coronado Street
2   I used to get drunk
3   and throw the radio through the window
4   while it was playing, and, of course,
5   it would break the glass in the window
6   and the radio would sit out there on the roof
7   still playing
8   and I'd tell my woman,
9   "Ah, what a marvelous radio!"


10   the next morning I'd take the window
11   off the hinges
12   and carry it down the street
13   to the glass man
14   who would put in another pane.


15   I kept throwing that radio through the window
16   each time I got drunk
17   and it would sit out there on the roof
18   still playing---
19   a magic radio
20   a radio with guts,
21   and each morning I'd take the window
22   back to the glass man.


23   I don't remember how it ended exactly
24   though I do remember
25   we finally moved out.
26   there was a woman downstairs who worked in
27   the garden in her bathing suit
28   and her husband complained he couldn't sleep nights
29   because of me
30   so we moved out
31   and in the next place
32   I either forgot to throw the radio out the window
33   or I didn't feel like it
34   anymore.

[Page 72 ]




35   I do remember missing the woman who worked in the
36   garden in her bathing suit,
37   she really dug with that trowel
38   and she put her behind up in the air
39   and I used to sit in the window
40   and watch the sun shine all over that thing


41   while the music played.

        Bleed a Bit (1979) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   he's almost 80 and they went to
2   visit him the other
3   day. he was sitting in his chair
4   with a burlap rug over his
5   lap
6   and when they walked in
7   the first thing he said was
8   "Don't touch my cock!"


9   he had a gallon jug of
10   zinfandel in his
11   refrigerator, had just gotten off
12   of
13   5 days of
14   tequila.


15   a new $600 piano was in the center of
16   the room,
17   he'd bought it for his
18   son.


19   he's always phoning for /me/ to come over
20   but when I do
21   he's very dull. he agrees with
22   everything I say and
23   then he goes to
24   sleep.


25   Solid State Marty.
26   when I'm not there
27   he does everything:
28   sets fire to the couch
29   pisses on his belly
30   sings the National Anthem.

[Page 74 ]




31   he gets call girls over and
32   squirts them with
33   seltzer water, he
34   rips the telephone wire out
35   of the wall


36   but before he does
37   he telephones
38   Paris
39   Madrid
40   Tokyo


41   he beats dogs
42   cats
43   people
44   with his
45   silver crutch


46   he tells stories about
47   how he was a
48   matador
49   a boxer
50   a pimp
51   a friend of Ernie's
52   a friend of Picasso


53   but when I come over
54   he goes to sleep
55   upright in his chair
56   grey hair rumbling down over
57   the silent
58   dumb hawk face


59   his son starts talking
60   and then it's time
61   for me
62   to go.

        Like a Percussion Instrument Until The Fingers Begin To Bleed a
        Bit (1979) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   young men from the underground
2   newspapers and the small circulation
3   magazines come
4   more and more often
5   to interview me---
6   their hair is long
7   they are thin
8   have tape recorders and
9   arrive with
10   much beer.
11   most
12   of them
13   manage to stay some hours and
14   get intoxicated.


15   if one of my girlfriends is around
16   I get her to do the
17   talking.
18   go ahead, I say, tell them the
19   truth about me.


20   then they tell what they think is
21   the truth.


22   they paint me to resemble the
23   idiot
24   which is true.


25   then I'm questioned:


26   /why did you stop writing for ten/
27   /years?/


28   I don't know.


29   /how come you didn't get into the/
30   /army?/

[Page 76 ]




31   crazy.


32   /can you speak German?/


33   no.


34   /who are your favorite modern/
35   /writers?/


36   I don't know.



37   I seldom see the
38   interviews. although once one of
39   the young men wrote back that
40   my girlfriend had
41   kissed him
42   when I was in the bathroom.


43   you got off easy, I wrote back
44   and by the way
45   forget that shit I told you about
46   Dos Passos. or was it
47   Mailer? it's hot tonight
48   and half the neighborhood is
49   drunk. the other half is
50   dead.
51   if I have any advice about writing
52   poetry, it's---
53   don't. I'm going to send out for
54   some fried chicken.

1   I was young
2   no stomach
3   arms of wire
4   but strong


5   I arrived drunk at the factory
6   every morning
7   and out-worked the whole pack of them
8   without strain


9   the old guy
10   his name was Sully
11   good old Irish Sully
12   he fumbled with screws


13   and whistled the same song all day
14   long:


15   /Yankee Doodle came to town/
16   Ridin' on a pony
17   He stuck a feather in his hat
18   And called it macaroni ...


19   they say he had been whistling that song
20   for years


21   I began whistling right along
22   with him


23   we whistled together for hours
24   him counting screws
25   me packing 8 foot long light fixtures into
26   coffin boxes

[Page 79 ]




27   as the days went on
28   he began to pale and tremble
29   he'd miss a note now and then


30   I whistled on


31   he began to miss days


32   then he missed a week


33   next I knew
34   the word got out
35   Sully was in a hospital for an
36   operation


37   2 weeks later he came in with a cane
38   and his wife


39   he shook hands with everybody


40   a 40 year man


41   when they had the retirement party for him
42   I missed it
43   because of a terrible
44   hangover


45   after he was gone
46   oddly
47   I kept looking for him,
48   and I realized that he had
49   never hated me, that I
50   had only hated
51   him
52   I began drinking more
53   missing more days


54   then they let me go
55   too

[Page 80 ]


56   I've never minded getting
57   fired but that was the one time
58   I felt it.

1   I care for you, darling, I love you,
2   the only reason I fucked L. is because you fucked
3   Z. and then I fucked R. and you fucked N.
4   and because you fucked N. I had to fuck
5   Y. But I think of you constantly, I feel you
6   here in my belly like a baby, love I'd call it,
7   no matter what happens I'd call it love, and so
8   you fucked C. and then before I could move
9   you fucked W., so then I had to fuck D. But
10   I want you to know that I love you, I think of you

1   always carry a notebook with you
2   wherever you go, he said,
3   and don't drink too much, drinking dulls
4   the sensibilities,
5   attend readings, note breath pauses,
6   and when /you/ read
7   always understate
8   underplay, the crowd is smarter than you
9   might think,
10   and when you write something
11   don't send it out right away,
12   put it in a drawer for two weeks,
13   then take it out and look
14   at it, and revise, revise,
15   REVISE again and again,
16   tighten lines like bolts holding the span
17   of a 5 mile bridge,
18   and keep a notebook by your bed,
19   you will get thoughts during the night
20   and these thoughts will vanish and be wasted
21   unless you notate them.
22   and don't drink, any fool can
23   drink, we are men of
24   letters.

1   I had a most difficult job
2   starting my 14 year old car today
3   in 100 degree heat
4   I had to take the carburetor off
5   leap back and forth
6   adjusting the set-screw,
7   a 2 by 4 jammed against the gas pedal
8   to hold it down.


9   I got it going---after 45 minutes---
10   I mailed 4 letters
11   purchased something cool
12   came back
13   got into my place
14   and listened to Ives
15   had dreams of empire
16   my great white belly against
17   the fan.

1   there are these 2 women
2   I know who are
3   quite similar


4   almost the same
5   age
6   well-read
7   literary


8   I once slept with both of
9   them
10   but that's all
11   over


12   we're friends


13   they've been to Africa
14   Paris
15   Greece


16   here and there


17   fucked some famous men


18   one is now living with a
19   millionaire
20   some few miles
21   from here
22   goes to breakfast and
23   dinner with him
24   feeds his fish his cats and
25   his dog
26   when she gets drunk she phones
27   me

[Page 85 ]




28   the other is having it
29   more difficult living
30   alone in a small apartment in
31   Venice (Calif.)
32   listening to the bongo
33   drums


34   famous men seem to want
35   young women


36   a young woman is easier
37   to get rid
38   of: they have more
39   places to
40   go


41   it is difficult for women who
42   were once beautiful
43   to get
44   old


45   they have to become more
46   intelligent (if they want to
47   hold their men) and do
48   more things
49   in bed and out of
50   bed


51   these 2 women I know
52   they're good both
53   in and out of
54   bed


55   and they're intelligent
56   intelligent enough to know
57   they can't come see me
58   and stay
59   more than an
60   hour or two

[Page 86 ]


61   they are quite
62   similar


63   and I know
64   if they read this poem
65   they'll understand
66   it
67   just as well as they
68   understand
69   Rimbaud or Rilke


70   or Keats


71   meanwhile I have met a
72   young blonde from the
73   Fairfax district


74   as she looks at my paintings
75   on the walls
76   I rub the bottoms of
77   her feet.

1   the drunk tank judge is
2   late like any other
3   judge and he is
4   young
5   well-fed
6   educated
7   spoiled and
8   from a good
9   family.


10   we drunks put out our cigarettes and await his
11   mercy.


12   those who couldn't make bail are
13   first. "guilty," they say, they all say,
14   "guilty."
15   "7 days." "14 days." "14 days and then you will be
16   released to the Honor Farm." "4 days." "7days."
17   "14 days."


18   "judge, these guys beat hell out of a man
19   in there."


20   "next."


21   "judge, they really beat hell out of me."


22   "next case, please."


23   "7 days." "14 days and then you will be released to the
24   Honor Farm."


25   the drunk tank judge is
26   young and
27   overfed. he has
28   eaten too many meals. he is
29   fat.

[Page 88 ]




30   the bail-out drunks are
31   next. they put us in long lines and
32   he takes us
33   quickly. "2 days or 40 dollars." "2 days or 40
34   dollars." "2 days or 40 dollars." "2 days or
35   40 dollars."


36   there are 35 or
37   40 of us.
38   the courthouse is on San Fernando Road among the
39   junkyards.


40   when we go to the bailiff he
41   tells us,
42   "your bail will apply."


43   "what?"


44   "your bail will apply."


45   the bail is $50. the court keeps the
46   ten.


47   we walk outside and get into our
48   old automobiles.
49   most of our automobiles look worse than
50   the ones in the
51   junkyards. some of us
52   don't have any
53   automobiles. most of us are
54   Mexicans and poor whites.
55   the trainyards are across the
56   street. the sun is up
57   good.


58   the judge has very
59   smooth
60   delicate
61   skin. the judge has

[Page 89 ]


62   fat
63   jowls.


64   we walk and we drive away from the
65   courthouse.


66   justice.

1   wooden butterfly
2   baking soda smile
3   sawdust fly---
4   I love my belly
5   and the liquor store man
6   calls me,
7   "Mr. Schlitz."
8   the cashiers at the race track
9   scream,
10   "THE POET KNOWS!"
11   when I cash my tickets.
12   the ladies
13   in and out of bed
14   say they love me
15   as I walk by with wet
16   white feet.


17   albatross with drunken eyes
18   Popeye's dirt-stained shorts
19   bedbugs of Paris,
20   I have cleared the barricades
21   have mastered the
22   automobile
23   the hangover
24   the tears
25   but I know
26   the final doom
27   like any schoolboy viewing
28   the cat being crushed
29   by passing traffic.


30   my skull has an inch and a
31   half crack right at the
32   dome.
33   most of my teeth are
34   in front. I get

[Page 91 ]


35   dizzy spells in supermarkets
36   spit blood when I drink
37   whiskey
38   and become saddened to
39   the point of
40   grief
41   when I think of all the
42   good women I have known
43   who have
44   dissolved
45   vanished
46   over trivialities:
47   trips to Pasadena,
48   children's picnics,
49   toothpaste caps down
50   the drain.


51   there is nothing to do
52   but drink
53   play the horse
54   bet on the poem


55   as the young girls
56   become women
57   and the machineguns
58   point toward me
59   crouched
60   behind walls thinner
61   than eyelids.


62   there's no defense
63   except all the errors
64   made.


65   meanwhile
66   I take showers
67   answer the phone
68   boil eggs

[Page 92 ]


69   study motion and waste
70   and feel as good
71   as the next while
72   walking in the sun.

3   68 years old
4   lifts weights
5   body like a young

7   kept his head
8   shaved
9   and drank port wine

11   kept the chain on the

14   you had to give
15   a special knock
16   to get in


17   he had brass knucks

28   never married after the death

46   washed his own underwear

        Bit (1979) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   I walked down the street for a submarine
2   sandwich
3   and this guy pulled out of the driveway
4   of The Institute of Sexual Education
5   and almost ran over my toes
6   with his bike;
7   he had a black dirty beard
8   eyes like a Russian pianist
9   and the breath of an East Kansas City whore;
10   it irritated me to be almost murdered by a
11   fool in a sequin jacket;
12   I looked upstairs and the girls sat in their chairs
13   outside their doors
14   dreaming old Greta Garbo movies;
15   I put a half a buck into one of the paper racks
16   and got the latest sex paper;
17   then I went into the sandwich shop
18   and ordered the submarine
19   and a large coffee.
20   they were all sitting in there talking about
21   how to lose weight.
22   I asked for a sideorder of
23   french fries.
24   the girls in the sex paper ads
25   looked like girls in sex paper ads.
26   they told me not to be lonely
27   that they could fix me up:
28   I could beat them with chains or whips
29   or they could beat me
30   with chains or whips, whichever way
31   I wanted it.
32   I finished, paid up, left a tip,
33   left the sex paper on the seat.
34   then I walked back up Western Avenue
35   with my belly hanging out over
36   my belt.

1   neatly in tune with
2   the song of a fish
3   I stand in the kitchen
4   halfway to madness
5   dreaming of Hemingway's
6   Spain.
7   it's muggy, like they say,
8   I can't breathe,
9   have crapped and
10   read the sports pages,
11   opened the refrigerator
12   looked at a piece of purple
13   meat,
14   tossed it back
15   in.


16   the place to find the center
17   is at the edge
18   that pounding in the sky
19   is just a water pipe
20   vibrating.


21   terrible things inch in the
22   walls; cancer flowers grow
23   on the porch; my white cat has
24   one eye torn
25   away and there are only 7 days
26   of racing left in the
27   summer meet.


28   the dancer never arrived from the
29   Club Normandy
30   and Jimmy didn't bring the
31   hooker,
32   but there's a postcard from
33   Arkansas

[Page 97 ]


34   and a throwaway from Food King:
35   10 free vacations to Hawaii,
36   all I got to do is
37   fill out the form.
38   but I don't want to go to
39   Hawaii.


40   I want the hooker with the pelican eyes
41   brass belly-button
42   and
43   ivory heart.


44   I take out the piece of purple
45   meat
46   drop it into the
47   pan.


48   then the phone rings.


49   I fall to one knee and roll under the
50   table. I remain there
51   until it
52   stops.


53   then I get up and
54   turn on the
55   radio.
56   no wonder Hemingway was a
57   drunk, Spain be damned,
58   I can't stand it
59   either.


60   it's so
61   muggy.

1   I see old people on pensions in the
2   supermarkets and they are thin and they are
3   proud and they are dying
4   they are starving on their feet and saying
5   nothing. long ago, among other lies,
6   they were taught that silence was
7   bravery. now, having worked a lifetime,
8   inflation has trapped them. they look around
9   steal a grape
10   chew on it. finally they make a tiny
11   purchase, a day's worth.
12   another lie they were taught:
13   thou shalt not steal.
14   they'd rather starve than steal
15   (one grape won't save them)
16   and in tiny rooms
17   while reading the market ads
18   they'll starve
19   they'll die without a sound
20   pulled out of roominghouses
21   by young blond boys with long hair
22   who'll slide them in
23   and pull away from the curb, these
24   boys
25   handsome of eye
26   thinking of Vegas and pussy and
27   victory.
28   it's the order of things: each one
29   gets a taste of honey
30   then the knife.

3   sunken cheeks


4   chain smoker


5   pissed out of windows
6   ignored women


7   snarled at landlords


8   rode boxcars through the badlands

11   ribs showing

1   sitting in a dark bedroom with 3 junkies,
2   female.
3   brown paper bags filled with trash are
4   everywhere.
5   it is one-thirty in the afternoon.
6   they talk about madhouses,
7   hospitals.
8   they are waiting for a fix.
9   none of them work.
10   it's relief and foodstamps and
11   Medi-Cal.


12   men are usable objects
13   toward the fix.


14   it is one-thirty in the afternoon
15   and outside small plants grow.
16   their children are still in school.
17   the females smoke cigarettes
18   and suck listlessly on beer and
19   tequila
20   which I have purchased.


21   I sit with them.
22   I wait on my fix:
23   I am a poetry junkie.


24   they pulled Ezra through the streets
25   in a wooden cage.
26   Blake was sure of God.
27   Villon was a mugger.
28   Lorca sucked cock.
29   T. S. Eliot worked a teller's cage.


30   most poets are swans,
31   egrets.

32   I sit with 3 junkies
33   at one-thirty in the afternoon.


34   the smoke pisses upward.


35   I wait.


36   death is a nothing jumbo.


37   one of the females says that she likes
38   my yellow shirt.


39   I believe in a simple violence.


40   this is
41   some of it.

        Percussion Instrument Until The Fingers Begin To Bleed a Bit
        (1979) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   my dentist is a drunk.
2   he rushes into the room while I'm
3   having my teeth cleaned:
4   "hey, you old fuck! you still
5   writing dirty stories?"
6   "yes."
7   he looks at the nurse:
8   "me and this old fuck, we both used
9   to work for the post office down at
10   the terminal annex!"
11   the nurse doesn't answer.
12   "look at us now! I we got /out/ of
13   there; we got out of that place,
14   didn't we?"
15   "yes, yes ..."
16   he runs off into another room.
17   he hires beautiful young girls,
18   they are everywhere.
19   they work a 4 day week and he drives
20   a yellow Caddy.
21   he has 8 rooms besides the waiting
22   room, all equipped.
23   the nurse presses her body against
24   mine. it's unbelievable
25   her breasts, her thighs, her body
26   press against me. she picks at my teeth
27   and looks into my eyes:
28   "am I hurting you?"
29   "no no, go ahead!"


30   in 15 minutes the dentist is back:
31   "hey, don't take too long!
32   what's going on, anyhow?"
33   "Dr., this man hasn't had his teeth
34   cleaned for 5 years. they're filthy!"
35   "all right, finish him off! give him

[Page 105 ]


36   another appointment!"
37   he runs out.
38   "would you like another appointment?"
39   she looks into my eyes.
40   "yes," I tell her.
41   she lets her body fall full against mine
42   and gives me a few last scrapes.
43   the whole thing only costs me forty dollars
44   including x-rays.


45   but she never told me her
46   name.

        Like a Percussion Instrument Until The Fingers Begin To Bleed a
        Bit (1979) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   I liked D. H. Lawrence
2   he could get so indignant
3   he snapped and he ripped
4   with wonderfully energetic sentences
5   he could lay the word down
6   bright and writhing
7   there was the stink of blood and murder
8   and sacrifice about him
9   the only tenderness he allowed
10   was when he bedded down his large German
11   wife.
12   I liked D. H. Lawrence---
13   he could talk about Christ
14   like he was the man next door
15   and he could describe Australian taxi drivers
16   so well you hated them
17   I liked D. H. Lawrence
18   but I'm glad I never met him
19   in some bistro
20   him lifting his tiny hot cup of
21   tea
22   and looking at me
23   with his worm-hole eyes.

1   the old girl friends still phone
2   some from last year
3   some from the year before
4   some from the years before that.
5   it's good to have things done with
6   when they don't work
7   it's also good not to hate
8   or even forget
9   the person you've failed
10   with.


11   and I like it when they tell me
12   they are having luck with a man
13   luck with their life.


14   after surviving me
15   they have many joys due them.
16   I make their lives seem better
17   after me.


18   now I have given them
19   comparisons
20   new horizons
21   new cocks
22   more peace
23   a good future
24   without me.


25   I always hang up,
26   justified.

        Like a Percussion Instrument Until The Fingers Begin To Bleed a
        Bit (1979) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   boxing matches and the racetracks
2   are where the guts are extracted and
3   rubbed into the cement
4   into the substance and stink of
5   being.


6   there is no peace either for the
7   flower or the tiger.
8   that's obvious.


9   what is not obvious are the rules.
10   there are no rules.


11   some attempt to find rules in the teachings of
12   others
13   and adjust to that
14   sight.


15   for me
16   obedience to another is the decay
17   of self.


18   for though every being is similar
19   each being is different


20   and to herd our differences
21   under one law
22   degrades each
23   self.


24   the boxing matches and the racetracks are
25   temples of learning


26   as the same horse and the same man
27   do not always win or lose
28   for the same reason

[Page 109 ]




29   so does learning
30   sometimes
31   stand still
32   pause or
33   reverse itself.


34   there are very very
35   few
36   guidelines.


37   no rules
38   but a hint:


39   watch for the lead right
40   and the last flash of the
41   tote.

1   are we going to the movies or not?
2   she asked him.


3   all right, he said, let's go.


4   I'm not going to put any panties on
5   so you can finger-fuck me in the
6   dark, she said.


7   should we get buttered popcorn?
8   he asked.


9   sure, she said.


10   leave your panties on,
11   he said.


12   what is it? she asked.


13   I just want to watch the movie,
14   he answered.


15   look, she said, I could go out on
16   the street, there are a hundred men
17   out there who'd be delighted to have
18   me.


19   all right, he said, go ahead out there.
20   I'll stay home and read the /National/
21   /Enquirer/ .


22   you son of a bitch, she said, I am
23   /trying/ to build a meaningful
24   relationship.


25   you can't build it with a hammer,
26   he said.

[Page 111 ]




27   are we going to the movies or not?
28   she asked.


29   all right, he said, let's
30   go ...


31   at the corner of Western and
32   Franklin he put on the blinker
33   to make his left turn
34   and a man in the on-coming lane
35   speeded-up
36   as if to cut him off.


37   brakes grabbed. there wasn't a
38   crash but there almost was one.


39   he cursed at the man in the other
40   car. the man cursed back. the
41   man had another person in the car with
42   him. it was /his/ wife.


43   they were going to the movies
44   too.

1   I had to come to the bathroom for something
2   and I knocked
3   and you were in the tub
4   you had washed your face and your hair
5   and I saw your upper body
6   and except for the breasts
7   you looked like a girl of 5, of 8
8   you were gently gleeful in the water
9   Linda Lee.
10   you were not only the essence of that
11   moment
12   but of all my moments
13   up to then
14   you bathing easily in the ivory
15   yet there was nothing
16   I could tell you.


17   I got what I wanted in the bathroom
18   something
19   and I left.

1   turmoil is the god
2   madness is the god


3   permanent living peace is
4   permanent living death.


5   agony can kill
6   or
7   agony can sustain life
8   but peace is always horrifying
9   peace is the worst thing
10   walking
11   talking
12   smiling,
13   seeming to be.


14   don't forget the sidewalks
15   the whores,
16   betrayal,
17   the worm in the apple,
18   the bars, the jails,
19   the suicides of lovers.


20   here in America
21   we have assassinated a president and his brother,
22   another president has quit office.


23   people who believe in politics
24   are like people who believe in god:
25   they are sucking wind through bent
26   straws.


27   there is no god
28   there are no politics
29   there is no peace
30   there is no love

[Page 114 ]


31   there is no control
32   there is no plan


33   stay away from god
34   remain disturbed


35   slide.

        Drunk Like a Percussion Instrument Until The Fingers Begin To
        Bleed a Bit (1979) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I like to prowl ordinary places
2   and taste the people---
3   from a distance.
4   I don't want them too near
5   because that's when attrition
6   starts.
7   but in supermarkets
8   laundromats
9   cafés
10   street corners
11   bus stops
12   eating places
13   drug stores
14   I can look at their bodies
15   and their faces
16   and their clothing---
17   watch the way they walk
18   or stand
19   or what they are doing.
20   I'm like an x-ray machine
21   I like them like that:
22   on view.
23   I imagine the best things
24   about them.
25   I imagine them brave and crazy
26   I imagine them beautiful.


27   I like to prowl the ordinary places.
28   I feel sorry for us all or glad for us
29   all
30   caught alive together
31   and awkward in that way.


32   there's nothing better than the joke
33   of us
34   the seriousness of us
35   the dullness of us

[Page 116 ]




36   buying stockings and carrots and gum
37   and magazines
38   buying birth control
39   candy
40   hair spray
41   and toilet paper.


42   we should build a great bonfire
43   we should congratulate ourselves on our
44   endurance


45   we stand in long lines
46   we walk about
47   we wait.


48   I like to prowl ordinary places
49   the people explain themselves to me
50   and I to them


51   a woman at 3:35 p.m.
52   weighing purple grapes on a scale
53   looking at that scale very
54   seriously
55   she is dressed in a simple green dress
56   with a pattern of white flowers
57   she takes the grapes
58   puts them carefully into a white paper
59   bag.


60   that's lightning enough


61   the generals and the doctors may kill us
62   but we have
63   won.

1   each night
2   well, almost every night
3   early in the evening
4   I see the old man
5   and his small black and white dog.
6   it's dark on these streets
7   and no matter how often he has seen me
8   he always gives me
9   a look that is frightened
10   and yet bold---
11   bold because his small brittle dog is
12   with him.
13   he wears old clothing
14   a wrinkled cap
15   cotton gloves
16   large square-toed shoes.
17   we never speak.
18   he is my age but I feel younger.
19   I neither like nor dislike the man and his
20   dog.
21   I have never seen either of them
22   defecate but I know that they
23   must.
24   he and his dog give me a feeling of
25   peace.
26   they belong
27   like the street signs
28   the lawns
29   the yellow windows
30   the sidewalks
31   the sirens and the telephone
32   wires.
33   the driveways
34   the parked cars
35   the moon when there is a
36   moon.

1   a girlfriend came in
2   built me a bed
3   scrubbed and waxed the kitchen floor
4   scrubbed the walls
5   vacuumed
6   cleaned the toilet
7   the bathtub
8   scrubbed the bathroom floor
9   and cut my toenails and
10   my hair.


11   then
12   all on the same day
13   the plumber came and fixed the kitchen faucet
14   and the toilet
15   and the gas man fixed the heater
16   and the phone man fixed the phone.
17   now I sit here in all this perfection.
18   it is quiet.
19   I have broken off with all 3 of my girlfriends.


20   I felt better when everything was in
21   disorder.
22   it will take me some months to get back to
23   normal:
24   I can't even find a roach to commune with.


25   I have lost my rhythm.
26   I can't sleep.
27   I can't eat.


28   I have been robbed of
29   my filth.

1   those lobsters
2   those 2 lobsters ...
3   yes, those bastards there.
4   we'll take them ...


5   so pink-red.


6   they say if you put them
7   in warm water first
8   they'll sleep
9   and when you boil them
10   they won't feel it.


11   how can we know?


12   no matter the burning tanks outside
13   Stalingrad
14   no matter that Hitler was a
15   vegetarian
16   no matter that the house I was born in
17   is now a brothel
18   in Andernach
19   no matter that my Uncle Heinrich
20   aged 92 and living in that same town
21   dislikes my novels and short stories.

1   when you
2   first meet them their eyes
3   are all under-
4   standing; laughter abounds
5   like sand fleas. then, Je-
6   sus, time tinkles on and
7   things leak. they
8   start making DEMANDS.
9   what they
10   demand is contrary to what-
11   ever you are, or could be.
12   strange is the
13   thought that they've never
14   read anything you've writ-
15   ten, not really read it at
16   all. or worse, if they have,
17   they've come to SAVE
18   you. which mainly means
19   making you like everybody
20   else. meanwhile they've sucked
21   you up and wound you tight
22   in a million webs, and
23   being something of a
24   feeling person you can't
25   help but remember the
26   good parts or the parts
27   that /seemed/ to be good.


28   you find yourself
29   alone again in your
30   bedroom grabbing your
31   guts and saying, o, shit
32   no, not again.


33   we should have known.
34   maybe we wanted cotton

[Page 121 ]


35   candy luck. maybe we
36   believed. what trash.
37   we believed like dogs
38   believe.

1   sweating in the kitchen
2   trying to hit one out of here
3   56 years old
4   fear bounding up my arms
5   toenails much too long
6   growth on side of leg


7   the difference in the factories was
8   we all felt pain
9   together


10   the other night I went to see the
11   great soprano
12   she was still beautiful
13   still sensual
14   still in personal mourning
15   but she missed note after note
16   drunk
17   she murdered art


18   sweating in the kitchen
19   I don't want to murder art


20   I should see the doctor and get that thing
21   cut off my leg
22   but I am a coward
23   I might scream and frighten a child
24   in the waiting room


25   I would like to fuck the great soprano
26   I'd like to weep in her hair


27   and there's Lorca down in the road
28   eating Spanish bullets in the dust

[Page 123 ]




29   the great soprano has never read my poems
30   but we both know how to murder art
31   drink and mourn


32   sweating in this kitchen
33   the formulas are gone
34   the best poet I ever knew is dead
35   the others write me letters


36   I tell them that I want to fuck
37   the great soprano
38   but they write back about other
39   things
40   useless things
41   dull things
42   vain things


43   I watch a fly land on my radio


44   he knows what it is
45   but he can't talk to me


46   the soprano is dead.

1   in the awesome strumming of no

3   I can never get too high


4   in places where giraffes run like
5   hate
6   I can never get too lonely


7   in bars where celluloid bartenders
8   serve poisoned laughter
9   I can never get too drunk


10   at the bottom of mountains

13   high lonely drunken grin of grief
14   I love you.

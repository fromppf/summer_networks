        Bukowski, Charles :  /what a man I was/ [from The Days Run Away
        Like Wild Horses Over the Hills (1969) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I shot off his left ear
2   then his right,
3   and then tore off his belt buckle
4   with hot lead,
5   and then
6   I shot off everything that counts
7   and when he bent over
8   to pick up his drawers
9   and his marbles
10   (poor critter)
11   I fixed it so he wouldn't have
12   to straighten up
13   no more.


14   Ho Hum.
15   I went in for a fast snort
16   and one guy /seemed/
17   to be looking at me sideways,
18   and that's how he died---
19   sideways,
20   lookin' at me
21   and clutchin'
22   for his marbles.


23   Sight o' blood made me kinda
24   hungry.
25   Had a ham sandwich.
26   Played a couple of sentimental songs ...
27   Shot out all the lights
28   and strolled outside.
29   Didn't seem to be no one around

[Page 14 ]


30   so I shot my horse
31   (poor critter).


32   Then I saw the Sheerf
33   a standin' at the end a' the road
34   and he was shakin'
35   like he had the Saint Vitus dance;
36   it was a real sorrowful sight
37   so I slowed him to a quiver
38   with the first slug
39   and mercifully stiffened him
40   with the second.


41   Then I laid on my back awhile
42   and I shot out the stars one by one
43   and then
44   I shot out the moon
45   and then I walked around
46   and shot out every light
47   in town,
48   and pretty soon it began to get dark
49   real dark
50   the way I like it;
51   just can't stand to sleep
52   with no light shinin'
53   on my face.


54   I laid down and dreamt
55   I was a little boy again
56   a playin' with my toy six-shooter
57   and winnin' all the marble games,
58   and when I woke up
59   my guns was gone
60   and I was all bound hand and foot
61   just like somebody
62   was scared a me

[Page 15 ]




63   and they was slippin'
64   a noose around my ugly neck
65   just as if they
66   meant to hang me,
67   and some guy was pinnin'
68   a real pretty sign
69   on my shirt:
70   /there's a law for you/
71   /and a law for me/
72   /and a law that hangs/
73   /from the foot of a tree/ .


74   Well, pretty poetry always did
75   make my eyes water
76   and can you believe it
77   all the women was cryin'
78   and though they was moanin'
79   other men's names
80   I just know they was cryin'
81   for me (poor critters)
82   and though I'd slept with all a them,
83   I'd forgotten
84   in all the big excitement
85   to tell 'em my name


86   and all the men looked angry
87   but I guess it was because the kids
88   was all being impolite
89   and a throwin' tin cans at me,
90   but I told 'em not to worry
91   because their aim was bad anyhow
92   not a boy there looked like he'd turn
93   into a man---
94   90% homosexuals, the lot of them,
95   and some guy shouted
96   "let's send him to hell!"

[Page 16 ]




97   and with a jerk I was dancin'
98   my last dance,
99   but I swung out wide
100   and spit in the bartender's eye
101   and stared down
102   into Nellie Adam's breasts,
103   and my mouth watered again.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /mine/ [from The Days Run Away Like Wild
        Horses Over the Hills (1969) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   She lays like a lump
2   I can feel the great empty mountain
3   of her head.
4   But she is alive. She yawns and
5   scratches her nose and
6   pulls up the cover.
7   Soon I will kiss her goodnight
8   and we will sleep.
9   and far away is Scotland
10   and under the ground the
11   gophers run.
12   I hear engines in the night
13   and through the sky a white
14   hand whirls:
15   good night, dear, goodnight.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /freedom/ [from The Days Run Away Like Wild
        Horses Over the Hills (1969) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   he drank wine all night the night of the
2   28th. and he kept thinking of her:
3   the way she walked and talked and loved
4   the way she told him things that seemed true
5   but were not, and he knew the color of each
6   of her dresses
7   and her shoes---he knew the stock and curve of
8   each heel
9   as well as the leg shaped by it.


10   and she was out again when he came home, and
11   she'd come back with the special stink again,
12   and she did
13   she came in at 3 a.m. in the morning
14   filthy like a dung-eating swine
15   and
16   he took out the butcher knife
17   and she screamed
18   backing into the roominghouse wall
19   still pretty somehow
20   in spite of love's reek
21   and he finished the glass of wine.


22   that yellow dress
23   his favorite
24   and she screamed again.


25   and he took up the knife
26   and unhooked his belt
27   and tore away the cloth before her
28   and cut off his balls.

[Page 19 ]




29   and carried them in his hands
30   like apricots
31   and flushed them down the
32   toilet bowl
33   and she kept screaming
34   as the room became red


35   GOD O GOD!
36   WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?


37   and he sat there holding 3 towels
38   between his legs
39   not caring now whether she left or
40   stayed
41   wore yellow or green or
42   anything at all.


43   and one hand holding and one hand
44   lifting he poured
45   another wine.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /as the sparrow/ [from The Days Run Away
        Like Wild Horses Over the Hills (1969) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   To give life you must take life,
2   and as our grief falls flat and hollow
3   upon the billion-blooded sea
4   I pass upon serious inward-breaking shoals rimmed
5   with white-legged, white-bellied rotting creatures
6   lengthily dead and rioting against surrounding scenes.
7   Dear child, I only did to you what the sparrow
8   did to you; I am old when it is fashionable to be
9   young; I cry when it is fashionable to laugh.
10   I hated you when it would have taken less courage
11   to love.


[Page 21 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  /his wife, the painter/ [from The Days Run
        Away Like Wild Horses Over the Hills (1969) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   There are sketches on the walls of men and women and
2   ducks,
3   and outside a large green bus swerves through traffic like
4   insanity sprung from a waving line; Turgenev, Turgenev,
5   says the radio, and Jane Austen, Jane Austen, too.


6   "I am going to do her portrait on the 28th, while you are
7   at work."


8   He is just this edge of fat and he walks constantly, he
9   fritters; they have him; they are eating him hollow like
10   a webbed fly, and his eyes are red-suckled with anger-fear.


11   He feels the hatred and discard of the world, sharper than
12   his razor, and his gut-feel hangs like a wet polyp; and he
13   self-decisions himself defeated trying to shake his
14   hung beard from razor in water (like life), not warm enough.


15   /Daumier. Rue Transnonain, le 15 Avril, 1843. (Lithograph.)/
16   /Paris, Bibliotheque Nationale/ .


17   "She has a face unlike that of any woman I have ever
18   known."


19   "What is it? A love affair?"


20   "Silly. I can't love a woman. Besides, she's pregnant."


21   I can paint---a flower eaten by a snake; that sunlight is a
22   lie; and that markets smell of shoes and naked boys clothed,
23   and under everything some river, some beat, some twist that

[Page 22 ]


24   clambers along the edge of my temple and bites
25   nip-dizzy ...
26   men drive cars and paint their houses,
27   but they are mad; men sit in barber chairs; buy hats.


28   /Corot. Recollection of Mortefontaine/ .
29   /Paris, Louvre/ .


30   "I must write Kaiser, though I think he's a homosexual."


31   "Are you still reading Freud?"


32   "Page 299."


33   She made a little hat and he fastened two snaps under one
34   arm, reaching up from the bed like a long feeler from the
35   snail, and she went to church, and he thought now I h've
36   time and the dog.


37   About church: the trouble with a mask is it
38   never changes.


39   So rude the flowers that grow and do not grow beautiful.
40   So magic the chair on the patio that does not hold legs
41   and belly and arm and neck and mouth that bites into the
42   wind like the end of a tunnel.


43   He turned in bed and thought: I am searching for some
44   segment in the air. It floats about the people's heads.
45   When it rains on the trees it sits between the branches
46   warmer and more blood-real than the dove.


47   /Orozco. Christ Destroying the Cross/ .
48   /Hanover, Dartmouth College, Baker Library/ .


49   He burned away in sleep.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /down thru the marching/ [from The Days Run
        Away Like Wild Horses Over the Hills (1969) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   they came down thru the marching,
2   down thru St. Paul, St. Louis, Atlanta,
3   Memphis, New Orleans, they came
4   down thru the marching, thru
5   balloons and popcorn, past drugstores
6   and blondes and whirling cats,
7   they came down thru the marching
8   scaring the goats and the kids in
9   the fields, banging against the minds
10   of the sick in their hot beds, and
11   down in the cellar I got out the
12   colt. I ripped a hole in the screen
13   for better vision and when the legs
14   came walking by on top of my head,
15   I got a colonel, a major and 3 lieutenants
16   before the band stopped playing;
17   and now it's like a war, uniforms
18   everywhere, behind cars and brush,
19   and plang plang plang
20   my cellar is all fireworks, and I
21   fire back, the colt as hot as a
22   baked potato, I fire back and sing
23   sing, "Mine eyes have seen the glory
24   of the coming of the Lord; He is
25   tramping out the vintage ... "


[Page 24 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  /these things/ [from The Days Run Away Like
        Wild Horses Over the Hills (1969) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   these things that we support most well
2   have nothing to do with us,
3   and we do with them
4   out of of boredom or fear or money
5   or cracked intelligence;
6   our circle and our candle of light
7   being small,
8   so small we cannot bear it,
9   we heave out with Idea
10   and lose the Center:
11   all wax without the wick,
12   and we see names that once meant wisdom,
13   like signs into ghost towns,
14   and only the graves are real.


[Page 25 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  /poem for personnel managers:/ [from The
        Days Run Away Like Wild Horses Over the Hills (1969) , Black
        Sparrow Press ]



1   An old man asked me for a cigarette
2   and I carefully dealt out two.
3   "Been lookin' for job. Gonna stand
4   in the sun and smoke."


5   He was close to rags and rage
6   and he leaned against death.
7   It was a cold day, indeed, and trucks
8   loaded and heavy as old whores
9   banged and tangled on the streets ...


10   We drop like planks from a rotting floor
11   as the world strives to unlock the bone
12   that weights its brain.
13   (God is a lonely place without steak.)


14   We are dying birds
15   we are sinking ships---
16   the world rocks down against us
17   and we
18   throw out our arms
19   and we
20   throw out our legs
21   like the death kiss of the centipede:
22   but they kindly snap our backs
23   and call our poison "politics."


24   Well, we smoked, he and I---little men
25   nibbling fish-head thoughts ...

[Page 26 ]




26   All the horses do not come in,
27   and as you watch the lights of the jails
28   and hospitals wink on and out,
29   and men handle flags as carefully as babies,
30   remember this:


31   you are a great-gutted instrument of
32   heart and belly, carefully planned---
33   so if you take a plane for Savannah,
34   take the best plane;
35   or if you eat chicken on a rock,
36   make it a very special animal.
37   (You call it a bird; I call birds
38   flowers.)


39   And if you decide to kill somebody,
40   make it anybody and not somebody:
41   some men are made of more special, precious
42   parts: do not kill
43   if you will
44   a president or a King
45   or a man
46   behind a desk---
47   these have heavenly longitudes
48   enlightened attitudes.


49   If you decide,
50   take us
51   who stand and smoke and glower;
52   we are rusty with sadness and
53   feverish
54   with climbing broken ladders.


55   Take us:
56   we were never children
57   like your children.

[Page 27 ]


58   We do not understand love songs
59   like your inamorata.


60   Our faces are cracked linoleum,
61   cracked through with the heavy, sure
62   feet of our masters.


63   We are shot through with carrot tops
64   and poppyseed and tilted grammar;
65   we waste days like mad blackbirds
66   and pray for alcoholic nights.
67   Our silk-sick human smiles wrap around
68   us like somebody else's confetti:
69   we do not even belong to the Party.


70   We are a scene chalked-out with the
71   sick white brush of Age.


72   We smoke, asleep as a dish of figs.
73   We smoke, dead as a fog.


74   Take us.


75   A bathtub murder
76   or something quick and bright; our names
77   in the papers.


78   Known, at last, for a moment
79   to millions of careless and grape-dull eyes
80   that hold themselves private
81   to only flicker and flame
82   at the poor cracker-barrel jibes
83   of their conceited, pampered correct comedians.


84   Known, at last, for a moment,
85   as they will be known

[Page 28 ]


86   and as you will be known
87   by an all-gray man on an all-gray horse
88   who sits and fondles a sword
89   longer than the night
90   longer than the mountain's aching backbone
91   longer than all the cries
92   that have a-bombed up out of throats
93   and exploded in a newer, less-planned
94   land.


95   We smoke and the clouds do not notice us.
96   A cat walks by and shakes Shakespeare off of his back.
97   Tallow, tallow, candle like wax: our spines
98   are limp and our consciousness burns
99   guilelessly away
100   the remaining wick life has
101   doled out to us.


102   An old man asked me for a cigarette
103   and told me his troubles
104   and this
105   is what he said:
106   that Age was a crime
107   and that Pity picked up the marbles
108   and that Hatred picked up the
109   cash.


110   He might have been your father
111   or mine.


112   He might have been a sex-fiend
113   or a saint.


114   But whatever he was,
115   he was condemned
116   and we stood in the sun and

[Page 29 ]


117   smoked
118   and looked around
119   in our leisure
120   to see who was next in
121   line.


[Page 30 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  /ice for the eagles/ [from The Days Run
        Away Like Wild Horses Over the Hills (1969) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I keep remembering the horses
2   under the moon
3   I keep remembering feeding the horses
4   sugar
5   white oblongs of sugar
6   more like ice,
7   and they had heads like
8   eagles
9   bald heads that could bite and
10   did not.


11   The horses were more real than
12   my father
13   more real than God
14   and they could have stepped on my
15   feet but they didn't
16   they could have done all kinds of horrors
17   but they didn't.


18   I was almost 5
19   but I have not forgotten yet;
20   o my god they were strong and good
21   those red tongues slobbering
22   out of their souls.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /plea to a passing maid/ [from The Days Run
        Away Like Wild Horses Over the Hills (1969) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   girl in shorts, biting your nails, revolving your ass,
2   the boys are looking at you---
3   you hold more, it seems,
4   than Gauguin or Brahma or Balzac,
5   more, at least, than the skulls that swim at our feet,
6   your swagger breaks the Eiffel tower,
7   turns the heads of old newsboys long ago gone
8   sexually to pot;
9   your caged malarkey, your idiot's dance,
10   mugging it, delightful---don't ever wash stained under-
11   wear or chase your acts of love
12   through neighborhood alleys---
13   don't spoil it for us,
14   putting on weight and weariness,
15   settling for TV and a namby-pamby husband;
16   don't give up that absurd dispossessed wiggle
17   to water a Saturday's front lawn---
18   don't send us back to Balzac or introspection

1   spoor and anemia and deviltry
2   and what can we make of this?:
3   a belly in the trash ...
4   down by Mr. Saunders' beer cans
5   curled up like a cat;
6   life can be no less ludicrous
7   than rain
8   and as I take the lift
9   up to 3
10   I pass Mrs. Swanson
11   in the grate
12   powdered and really dead
13   but walking on
14   buying sweets and fats
15   and mailing Christmas cards;
16   and opening the door to my room
17   a fat damsel scrambles my vision
18   bottles fall
19   and a voice says
20   why are all your poems
21   personal?

1   were best, the French F. Legion
2   every man with a bitch and the Arabs charging down
3   on white parade ponies, and the Sarge't holding the
4   fort by propping up dead men until re'forcemnts arriv'l.
5   And the ones with the boys flying around in the Spads
6   full of wire and one plat. blonde who seemed to symbolize
7   everything. Maybe it was just because I was a kid
8   or maybe it isn't the same any more. All the angles,
9   the cautious patriots, the air-raid wardens, cigarettes
10   for sex, and even the enemy seeming to play a game.
11   Or the time they found the Jap nurse in the shell-hole
12   who had been hit in the breast and wanted some sulfa
13   and one of the boys said, "Hey, you think we can fuck
14   her before she dies?"

        Bukowski, Charles :  /peace/ [from The Days Run Away Like Wild

1   I thought the dove was the bird of peace
2   but here they were shooting them out
3   of the brush
4   and climbing up the sides of mountains
5   and banging them down;
6   and everywhere the doves went
7   there were the hunters
8   blasting and beaming and blasting,
9   and one man who didn't
10   in the slightest
11   resemble a dove
12   was shot in the shoulder;
13   and there were many complaints
14   that the doves
15   were smaller and scarcer
16   than last year,
17   but the way they fell
18   through the air
19   when you stung the life
20   out of them
21   was the same;
22   and I was there too
23   but I couldn't shoot anything
24   with a paintbrush;
25   and a couple of them
26   came over to my canvas
27   and stood and stood and stood
28   until I finally said,
29   for God's sake
30   go look at Picasso and Rembrandt,
31   go look at Klee and Gauguin,

[Page 35 ]


32   listen to a symphony by Mahler,
33   and if you get anything
34   out of that
35   come back
36   and stare at my canvas!


37   what the hell's wrong with
38   him? the one guy
39   said.


40   he's nuts. they're all nuts,
41   the other guy said. anyhow,
42   I got my 10 doves.


43   me too, his buddy said, let's
44   go home: we can have them
45   in the pan
46   by 2:30.

1   I pick up the skirt,
2   I pick up the sparkling beads
3   in black,
4   this thing that moved once
5   around flesh,
6   and I call God a liar,
7   I say anything that moved
8   like that
9   or knew
10   my name
11   could never die
12   in the common verity of dying,

14   up her lovely
15   dress,
16   all her loveliness gone,
17   and I speak
18   to all the gods,
19   Jewish gods, Christ-gods,
20   chips of blinking things,
21   idols, pills, bread,
22   fathoms, risks,
23   knowledgeable surrender,
24   rats in the gravy of 2 gone quite mad
25   without a chance,
26   hummingbird knowledge, hummingbird chance,
27   I lean upon this,
28   I lean on all of this
29   and I know:

30   her dress upon my arm:

1   it should have been Mexico
2   she always liked Mexico
3   and Arizona and New Mexico
4   and tacos,
5   but not the flies
6   and so there I was
7   standing there---
8   durable
9   visible
10   clothed
11   waiting.


12   the priest was angry:
13   he had been arguing with the boy
14   for several days
15   over his mother's right to have a
16   Catholic burial
17   and they finally settled
18   that it could not be in
19   church
20   but he would say the
21   thing at the grave.
22   the priest cared about
23   technicalities
24   the son did not care
25   except about the
26   bill.


27   I was the
28   lover

[Page 40 ]


29   and I cared but what I cared for
30   was dead.


31   there were just 3 of
32   us: son,
33   landlady,
34   lover. it was
35   hot. the priest waved his words
36   in the air and
37   then he was
38   done. I walked to the
39   priest and thanked him for the
40   words.
41   and we walked
42   off
43   we got into the car
44   we drove away.


45   it should have been Mexico
46   or Uruguay or hell.
47   the son let me out at my
48   place and said he'd write me about a
49   stone but I knew he was lying---
50   that if there was to be a stone
51   the lover would
52   put it there.


53   I went upstairs and turned on the
54   radio and pulled down the
55   shades.

1   I could tell by the crouch of the cat,
2   the way it was flattened,
3   that it was insane with prey;
4   and when my car came upon it,
5   it rose in the twilight
6   and made off
7   with bird in mouth,
8   a very large bird, gray,
9   the wings down like broken love,
10   the fangs in,
11   life still there
12   but not much,
13   not very much.


14   the broken love-bird
15   the cat walks in my mind
16   and I cannot make him out:
17   the phone rings,
18   I answer a voice,
19   but I see him again and again,
20   and the loose wings
21   the loose gray wings,
22   and this thing held
23   in a head that knows no mercy;
24   it is the world, it is ours;
25   I put the phone down
26   and the cat-sides of the room
27   come in upon me
28   and I would scream,
29   but they have places for people

[Page 44 ]


30   who scream;
31   and the cat walks
32   the cat walks forever

1   O ants crawl my drunken arms
2   and they let Van Gogh sit in a cornfield
3   and take Life out of the world with a
4   shotgun,
5   ants crawl my drunken arms
6   and they set Rimbaud
7   to running guns and looking under rocks
8   for gold,
9   O ants crawl my drunken arms,
10   they put Pound in a nuthouse
11   and made Crane jump into the sea
12   in his pajamas,
13   ants, ants crawl my drunken arms
14   as our schoolboys scream for Willie Mays
15   instead of Bach,
16   ants crawl my drunken arms
17   through the drink I reach

21   or a dead Sunday bull,
22   and the ants crawl into my mouth

24   I wash them down with wine

1   Markov claims I am trying
2   to stab his soul
3   but I'd prefer his wife.


4   I put my feet on the coffee table
5   and he says,
6   I don't mind you putting
7   your feet on the coffee table
8   except that the legs are wobbly
9   and the thing
10   will fall apart
11   any minute.


12   I leave my feet on the table
13   but I'd prefer his wife.


14   I would rather, says Markov,
15   entertain a ditch-digger
16   or a newsvendor
17   because they are kind enough
18   to observe the decencies
19   even though
20   they don't know
21   Rimbaud from rat poison.


22   my empty beercan
23   rolls to the floor.


24   that I must die
25   bothers me less than
26   a straw, says Markov,

[Page 47 ]


27   my part of the game
28   is that I must live
29   the best I can.


30   I grab his wife as she walks by,
31   and then her can is against my belly,
32   and she has fine knees and breasts
33   and I kiss her.


34   it is not so bad, being old, he says,
35   a calmness sets in, but here's the catch:
36   to keep calmness and deadness
37   separate; never to look upon youth
38   as inferior because you are old,
39   never to look upon age as wisdom
40   because you have experience. a
41   man can be old and a fool---
42   many are, a man can be young
43   and wise---few are. a---


44   for Christ's all sake, I wailed,
45   shut up!


46   he walked over and got his cane and
47   walked out.


48   you've hurt his feelings, she said,
49   he thinks you are a great poet.


50   he's too slick for me, I said,
51   he's too wise.


52   I had one of her breasts out.
53   it was a monstrous
54   beautiful
55   thing.

6   water like slow running of rusty

1   Hugo Wolf went mad while eating an onion
2   and writing his 253rd song; it was rainy
3   April and the worms came out of the ground
4   humming Tannhüuser, and he spilled his milk
5   with his ink, and his blood fell out to the walls
6   and he howled and he roared and he screamed, and
7   down-
8   stairs his landlady said, I /knew/ it, that rotten son
9   of a
10   bitch has dummied up his brain, he's jacked-off
11   his last piece
12   of music and now I'll never get the rent, and some-
13   day he'll be fam-
14   ous and they'll bury him in the rain, but right now
15   I wish he'd shut
16   up that god damned screaming---for my money he's
17   a silly pansy jackass
18   and when they move him out of here, I hope they
19   move in a good solid fish-

1   the reason for the riot was we kept getting beans
2   and a guard grabbed a colored boy who threw his on
3   the floor
4   and somebody touched a button
5   and everybody was grabbing everybody;
6   I clubbed my best friend behind the ear
7   somebody threw coffee in my face
8   (what the hell, you couldn't drink it)
9   and I got out to the yard
10   and I heard the guns going
11   and it seemed like every con had a knife but me,
12   and all I could do was pray and run
13   and I didn't have a god and was fat from playing
14   poker for pennies with my cellmate,
15   and the warden's voice started coming over the cans,
16   and I heard later, in the confusion,
17   the cook raped a sailor,
18   and I lost my shaving cream, a pack of smokes
19   and a copy of /The New Yorker/ ;
20   also 3 men were shot,
21   a half dozen knifed,
22   35 put in the hole,
23   all yard privileges suspended,
24   the screws as jittery as L.A. bookies,
25   the prison radio off,
26   real quiet,
27   visitors sent home,
28   but the next morning
29   we did get our mail---
30   a letter from St. Louis:

[Page 52 ]


31   /Dear Charles, I am sorry you are in prison/ ,
32   /but you cannot break the law/ ,
33   and there was a pressed carnation,
34   perfume, the looming of outside,
35   kisses and panties,
36   laughter and beer,
37   and that night for dinner
38   they marched us all back down
39   to the beans.

13   room
14   in Chinatown
15   with a window as large as the
16   side of the world
17   filled with night flies and neon,
18   lighted like Broadway
19   to frighten away rats,
20   and I walked into a bar and sat down,
21   and the Chinaman looked at my rags
22   and said
23   no credit
24   and I pulled out a hundred dollar bill
25   and asked for a cup of Confucius juice
26   and 2 China dolls with slits of eyes
27   just about the size of the rest of them
28   slid closer
29   and we sat

31   waited.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /a poem is a city/ [from The Days Run Away

1   a poem is a city filled with streets and sewers
2   filled with saints, heroes, beggars, madmen,
3   filled with banality and booze,
4   filled with rain and thunder and periods of
5   drought, a poem is a city at war,
6   a poem is a city asking a clock why,
7   a poem is a city burning,
8   a poem is a city under guns
9   its barbershops filled with cynical drunks,
10   a poem is a city where God rides naked
11   through the streets like Lady Godiva,
12   where dogs bark at night, and chase away
13   the flag; a poem is a city of poets,
14   most of them quite similar
15   and envious and bitter ...
16   a poem is this city now,
17   50 miles from nowhere,
18   9:09 in the morning,
19   the taste of liquor and cigarettes,
20   no police, no lovers, walking the streets,
21   this poem, this city, closing its doors,
22   barricaded, almost empty,
23   mournful without tears, aging without pity,
24   the hardrock mountains,
25   the ocean like a lavender flame,
26   a moon destitute of greatness,
27   a small music from broken windows ...


28   a poem is a city, a poem is a nation,
29   a poem is the world ...

[Page 55 ]


30   and now I stick this under glass
31   for the mad editor's scrutiny,
32   and night is elsewhere
33   and faint gray ladies stand in line,
34   dog follows dog to estuary,
35   the trumpets bring on gallows
36   as small men rant at things
37   they cannot do.

1   the hunter goes by my window
2   4 feet locked in the bright stillness of a
3   yellow and blue
4   night.


5   cruel strangeness takes hold in wars, in
6   gardens---
7   the yellow and blue night explodes before
8   me, atomic, surgical,
9   full of starlit
10   devils ...


11   then the cat leaps up on the
12   fence, a tubby dismay,
13   stupid, lonely,
14   whiskers like an old lady in the
15   supermarket
16   and naked as the
17   moon.


18   I am temporarily
19   delighted.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /hermit in the city/ [from The Days Run

1   Idle in the forest of my room
2   with tungsten trees, owl boiling coffee,
3   webs cowled in gold over windows
4   staring outward into hell;
5   cigarette breath: statues of perfection,
6   not stuffed or whirled in cancers
7   of ranting;
8   engines and wheels crawl to gaseous
9   ends along the sabre-tooth;
10   my trees climb with monkey-rhyme,
11   climb out through the ceiling
12   breaking TV antennas and
13   the dull howl of canned laughter,
14   canned humor, canned death;
15   idle, idle in this forest,
16   calla lilies, grass, stone,
17   all nighttime level peace
18   of no bombers or faces,
19   and I dream the stone dream,
20   the grass dream,
21   the river running through my
22   fingerbones
23   one hundred and fifty years away,
24   leaving shots of grit and gold
25   and radium,
26   lifted and turned
27   by dizzied fish
28   and dropped,
29   raising flecks of sand
30   in my sleep ...

[Page 58 ]


31   The owl spits his coffee,
32   my monkeys chit the gibberish plan,

34   my walls help endure the seizing.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /all-yellow flowers/ [from The Days Run
        Away Like Wild Horses Over the Hills (1969) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   through the venetian blinds I saw a fat man in a brown coat
2   (with a head I can only describe as like a marshmallow)
3   drag the casket from the hearse: it was battleship gray
4   with all-yellow flowers.
5   they put it on a roller that was hidden in purple drape
6   and the marshmallow-man and one pin-crisp bloodless woman
7   walked for /him/ up the incline ... and!---
8   /gore-bell-horror-sheer-sheen-world-ending-moment!---/
9   almost losing IT there, once---
10   I could see the body rolling out
11   like one loose dice in a losing game---the arms waving
12   windmills and legs kicking autumn footballs.


13   they made it into the church
14   and I remained outside
15   opening my brain to living sunlight.


16   in the room with me she was singing and rolling her
17   long golden hair. (this is true Arturo, and that is what
18   makes it so simple.)
19   "I just saw them take in a body,"
20   I fashioned to her.


21   it's autumn, it's trees, it's telephone wires,
22   and she sings some song I can't understand, some High Mass
23   of Life.


24   she went on singing but I wanted to die
25   I wanted yellow flowers like her golden hair
26   I wanted yellow-singing and the sun.

[Page 62 ]




27   this is true, and that is what makes it so strange:
28   I wanted to be opened and untangled, and
29   tossed away.

        [from The Days Run Away Like Wild Horses Over the Hills (1969) ,
        Black Sparrow Press ]


1   the service was bad
2   and the bellboy kept bringing in towels
3   at the wrong moment.
4   drunk, I finally clubbed him along
5   the side of the head.
6   he was a little man and he fell
7   like an October leaf,
8   quite done,
9   and when the fuzz came up
10   I had the sofa in front of the door
11   and the chain on,
12   the 2nd movement of Brahms' First Symphony
13   and had my hand halfway up the ass
14   of a broad old enough to be my grandmother
15   and they broke the god damned door,
16   pushed the sofa aside;
17   I slapped the screaming chippy
18   and turned and asked,
19   what seems to be the trouble, gentlemen?
20   and some young kid who had never shaved
21   brought his stick down against my head
22   and in the morning I was in the prison ward
23   chained to my bed
24   and it was hot,
25   the sweat coming down through the white
26   senseless sheet,
27   and they asked all sorts of silly questions
28   and I knew I'd be late for work,
29   which worried me immensely.

1   swans die in the Spring too
2   and there it floated
3   dead on a Sunday
4   sideways
5   circling in current
6   and I walked to the rotunda
7   and overhead
8   gods in chariots
9   dogs, women
10   circled,
11   and death
12   ran down my throat
13   like a mouse,
14   and I heard the people coming
15   with their picnic bags
16   and laughter,
17   and I felt guilty
18   for the swan
19   as if death
20   were a thing of shame
21   and like a fool
22   I walked away
23   and left them
24   my beautiful swan.

1   things are good as I am not dead yet
2   and the rats move in the beercans,
3   the papersacks shuffle like small dogs,
4   and her photographs are stuck onto a painting
5   by a dead German and she too is dead
6   and it took 14 years to know her
7   and if they give me another 14
8   I will know her yet ...
9   her photos stuck over the glass
10   neither move nor speak,
11   but I even have her voice on tape,
12   and she speaks some evenings,
13   her again
14   so real she laughs
15   says the thousand things,
16   the one thing I always ignored;
17   this will never leave me:
18   that I had love
19   and love died;
20   a photo and a piece of tape
21   is not much, I have learned late,
22   but give me 14 days or 14 years,
23   I will kill any man
24   who would touch or take
25   whatever's left.

1   he died a suicide in a Detroit hotel room
2   on skid row
3   and he was stiff when they found him,
4   rat poison ...
5   I was managing the place then,
6   trying to collect rents and
7   emptying the trash,
8   and I stood there and watched them put the needle in him,
9   his eyes were wide open and one of them slid his eyes
10   shut, and then the needle began to take hold,
11   he had died stiff upright in the chair
12   and he began to loosen up
13   and they found a couple of letters from his sister
14   in another city, threw him on the stretcher and took him
15   down the stairs. the sheets were still kinda clean
16   so I just made the bed over again, cleaned out the dresser,
17   and when I walked out, all the winos were in the hall
18   in their pants and dirty undershirts, needing shaves and
19   something to
20   drink, and I told them: "all right, all you monkeys
21   clear the god damned halls! you hurt my eyesight!"
22   "a man died, sir. he was our friend," one of them said.
23   it was Benny the Dip. "all right, Benny," I told him,
24   "you've got one night left in here to get up the rent!"
25   you should have seen the rest of them disappear:
26   death doesn't matter a damn when you need a place
27   to sleep.

1   original courage is good,

3   and if you say they are trained

        Bukowski, Charles :  /conversation with a lady sipping a
        straight shot/ [from The Days Run Away Like Wild Horses Over the
        Hills (1969) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   and Joe he was not much good
2   even at half past 40, he insensibly
3   loved whore and horse like the average man,
4   his age would love what brought up color
5   out of the stem of a dahlia, but so it goes,
6   the gods break us in half with more than
7   lightning, twice married twice divorced,
8   who can ask for more than bloodshot eyes
9   and bumblebeebelly, good men are broken
10   daily in the Korea of useless sunlight;
11   quitting jobs, getting fired more than rockets,
12   knowing nothing, absolutely nothing
13   except maybe the way he wanted his haircut,
14   bouncing like a 16-year-old kid out of a
15   bad dream, always late for work
16   but never late for the first race
17   or the end stool down at the HAPPY NIGHT.
18   the saying is, Joe never grew up
19   but in another way he never grew down either,
20   trying to puff life into himself through his
21   cheap cigar and flat jukebox music,
22   or fat June who didn't care either,
23   telling her over and over,
24   Baby, wait'll you see what I've got!
25   as if the whole thing were something new
26   and fat June staring into her all-important beer
27   shaking it and enjoying it
28   as she would never enjoy herself again.


29   and when Joe went, a child went,
30   but they remember him: the whores, the bartenders,

[Page 71 ]


31   the bosses, the state unemployment offices,
32   and the jocks---
33   the way he used to stand down by the rail
34   and say as they paraded past:
35   "Hi, Willie! How's your mother today?"
36   or, "Eddie, you oughta get one made of wood,
37   the way you're riding lately."


38   Joe I saw on that last night and he threw his
39   glass into the mirror and the bartender
40   mad as hell chased him with a baseball bat
41   swinging at his balls and everything else,
42   driving him out into the street and into the path
43   of a bull with one horn that didn't sound,
44   a new Cad a lot tougher than Joe and a lot more
45   valuable, and that's the way the scales balance:
46   broken mirror, broken Joe.


47   and when I went in the next night the mirror was
48   still broken and Helen, fat Helen, was shaking her beer,
49   and I bought her a shot and I said, "Baby, I've got
50   something to show you, something like you've never
51   seen before."


52   and she smiled, but it wasn't what she was thinking.

1   to die with your boots on
2   while writing poetry
3   is not as glorious
4   as riding a horse
5   down Broadway
6   with a stick of dynamite
7   in your teeth,
8   but neither is
9   adding the sum total
10   of all the planets
11   named or visible
12   to man,
13   and the horse was a gray,
14   the man's name was
15   Sanchez or Kandinsky,
16   it was 79 degrees

18   yelling,

1   we fought for 17 days inside that tent
2   thrusting and counter-thrusting
3   but finally she got away
4   and I walked outside
5   and spit
6   in the dirty sand.


7   Abdullah, I said, why don't you
8   wash your shorts? you've been
9   wearing the same
10   shorts
11   for 17 years.


12   Effendi, he said, it's the sun,
13   the sun cleans everything. what
14   went with the girl?


15   I don't know if I couldn't
16   please her
17   or if I couldn't
18   catch her. she was
19   pretty young.


20   what did she cost, Effendi?


21   17 camel.


22   he whistled through his broken
23   teeth. aren't you going
24   to catch her?

[Page 74 ]


25   howinthehell how? can I get
26   my camels back?


27   you are an American, he said.


28   I walked into the tent
29   fell upon the ground
30   and held my head
31   within
32   my hands.


33   suddenly she burst within
34   the tent
35   laughing madly,
36   /Americano/ ,
37   /Americano!/


38   please
39   go away
40   I said quietly.


41   men are, she said sitting down and rolling down
42   her stockings, some parts titty and some parts
43   tiger. you don't mind
44   if I roll down
45   my stockings?


46   I don't mind, I said,
47   if you roll down the top
48   of your dress. whores are
49   always rolling down
50   their hose. please
51   go away. I read where
52   the cruiser crew passed the helmet
53   for the red cross; I think I'll

[Page 75 ]



54   have them pass it
55   to brace your flabby
56   butt.


57   have 'em pass the helmet twice, dad,
58   she said, howcum you don't love me
59   no more?


60   I been thinking, I said,
61   how can Love have a urinary tract
62   and distended bowels?
63   pack up, daughter, and flow,
64   maneuver out of the mansions
65   of my sight!


66   you forget, daddy-o, we're in
67   /my/ tent!


68   oh, christ, I said, the trivialities
69   of private ownership! where's my
70   hat?


71   you were wearing a towel, dad, but
72   kiss me, daddy, hold me in your arms!


73   I walked over and mauled her breasts.


74   I drink too much beer, she said,
75   I can't help it if I
76   piss.


77   we fucked for 17 days.

1   I have never seen such an animal
2   except perhaps once,
3   but that is another story---
4   there it stood,
5   no lion
6   yet no dog
7   no deer yet deer
8   frozen nose
9   and eye, all eye gathering all the
10   moonlight that hung in trees;
11   and everywhere the people slept;
12   I saw bombers over Brazil,
13   cathedrals choked in silk,
14   the gray dice of Vegas,
15   a Van Gogh over the kitchen sink.


16   home, I poured a drink
17   took off my gloves you god damned thing
18   why could you have not been a woman
19   with all your beauty,
20   with all your beauty
21   I have not found her yet.

1   I get on the train on the way to the track
2   it's down near Dago
3   and this gives some space and rolling and
4   I have my pint
5   and I walk to the barcar for a couple of
6   beers
7   and I weave upon the floor---
8   THACK THACK THACKA THACK THACK
9   THACKA THACK---
10   and some of it comes back
11   a little of it comes back
12   like some green in a leaf after a long
13   dryness


14   and the sun crashes into the barcar like a
15   bull and the bartender sees that
16   I am feeling good
17   he smiles a real smile and
18   asks---
19   "How's it going?"


20   how's it going? my heels are down
21   my shoes cracked
22   I am wearing my father's pants and he died
23   10 years ago
24   I need 8 teeth pulled
25   my intestine has a partial blockage
26   I puff on a dime cigar


27   "Great!" I answer him,
28   "how you making?"

29   glory glory glory and the train rolls on

31   past the sand and
32   down in between the

        Bukowski, Charles :  /I thought of ships, of armies, hanging on/
        ... [from The Days Run Away Like Wild Horses Over the Hills
        (1969) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I have practiced death for so long
2   and still I have not learned it,
3   and tonight I came in
4   and my goldfish was not in his bowl,
5   he had leaped
6   for reasons of his own
7   (I had changed the water; it might have been
8   a fly ...)
9   and he was now on the rug
10   with black spots upon his golden body,
11   and he was still and he was stiff
12   but I put him back in the water
13   (some sound told me to do this)
14   and I seemed to see the gills move,
15   a large air bubble formed
16   but the body was still stiff
17   but miraculously
18   it did not float flat---
19   the tail part was down in the water,
20   and I thought of ships, of armies,
21   hanging on,
22   and then I saw the small fins
23   near the underside of the head
24   move
25   and I sat down on the couch
26   and tried to read,
27   tried not to think
28   that the woman who had given me these fish
29   was now dead 6 months,
30   the world going on past living things
31   now no longer living,

[Page 80 ]


32   and the other fish had died.
33   he had overeaten, he had eaten his meal
34   and most of the meal of the small one,
35   and now the woman was gone
36   and the small one was stiff,
37   and an hour later
38   when I got up
39   he floated flat and finished;
40   his eyes looking up at me did not look at me
41   but into places I could not see,
42   and the slave carried the master,
43   this goldfish with black spots
44   and dumped him into the toilet
45   and flushed him away.


46   I put the bowl in the corner
47   and thought, I really cannot stand
48   much more of this.


49   dead fish, dead ladies, dead wars.


50   it does seem a miracle to see anybody alive
51   and now somebody on the radio is playing
52   a guitar very slowly and I think, yes,
53   he too: his fingers, his hands, his mind,
54   and his music goes on but it is very still
55   it is very quiet, and I am tired.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /war and piece/ [from The Days Run Away
        Like Wild Horses Over the Hills (1969) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   all the efforts of the Spanish to effect peace
2   were in vain and Domenico came over the hill
3   and shot the white chicken and raped the woman
4   in the hut, and then he rode up the road
5   noticing the pink anemones, the lazy toads,
6   and when he got to town he ate a hot tamale,
7   and through the window he saw the fleet
8   and the fleet put its guns even with the town,
9   he saw that, and in came a wind of fire,
10   and in the smoke he grabbed the cigarette girl
11   and raped her, then he got back on his mule
12   which stepped carefully over the dead
13   and he rode back to the village where his own hut
14   still stood, and the old lady was outside
15   rubbing clothes on rocks by the stream,
16   and in the air came the planes
17   looking them over
18   banking their wings
19   and finally deciding
20   that they were not worth the bombs,
21   they left
22   like large undecided butterflies,
23   and Domenico went inside and fell
24   upon the floor
25   and the old lady came in
26   wiggling what was left,
27   and he said, /war is a horrible thing/ ,
28   and he wondered if anybody would ever bother
29   to rape her,
30   he would not stop them, they

[Page 82 ]


31   could have it, not much there, nothing,
32   and he decided that sleep was better than nothing
33   and he went to sleep.

        have been/ [from The Days Run Away Like Wild Horses Over the
        Hills (1969) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   driving in from the track
2   I saw a woman in green
3   all rump and breast and dizziness running
4   across the street.
5   she was as sexy as a
6   green and drunken antelope and
7   when she got to the curbing she
8   tripped and fell
9   down and
10   sat in the gutter and
11   I sat there in my car
12   looking at her and
13   oddly
14   I felt most impassive as if
15   nothing had happened and
16   I sat there looking at this
17   green creature until
18   a moving van 60 feet long came
19   to a stop and
20   helped the
21   lady
22   up.
23   a young man in white overalls
24   flushed red and the girl was built
25   all around all around and
26   stupid with falling and stupid with life and
27   swaying on the tower stilts of her
28   heels
29   she stood there rubbing her
30   white knees and

[Page 84 ]


31   the young man kept talking to
32   her
33   he was big dumb blond pink and lonely
34   but then
35   the woman asked him
36   where the nearest bar was and
37   he grinned and pointed down the street and
38   gave it
39   up
40   he got back into the truck and
41   60 feet full of
42   furniture and blanket and stove
43   pulled on down the street
44   and the green antelope
45   crossed the street
46   toward the bar
47   wobbling and shaking
48   shaking and wobbling
49   everything and
50   we sat transfixed and
51   watching
52   until
53   in the backed-up traffic
54   behind me
55   a man of strength
56   honked
57   and I put the thing in drive
58   slowing for the big dip
59   by the market
60   that could tear your car in
61   half
62   and they all followed me
63   slowing for the dip
64   too:
65   18 cars full of men thinking of
66   what could have been---

[Page 85 ]


67   about the one who
68   got away and
69   it was about sunset and
70   heavy traffic and heavy
71   life.

        Like Wild Horses Over the Hills (1969) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   one of the terrible things is
2   really
3   being in bed
4   night after night
5   with a woman you no longer
6   want to screw.


7   they get old, they don't look very good
8   anymore---they even tend to
9   snore, lose
10   spirit.


11   so, in bed, you turn sometimes,
12   your foot touches hers---
13   god, /awful!/ ---
14   and the night is out there
15   beyond the curtains
16   sealing you together
17   in the
18   tomb.


19   and in the morning you go to the
20   bathroom, pass in the hall, talk,
21   say odd things; eggs fry, motors
22   start.


23   but sitting across
24   you have 2 strangers
25   jamming toast into mouths
26   burning the sullen head and gut with
27   coffee.

[Page 87 ]




28   in 10 million places in America
29   it is the same---
30   stale lives propped against each
31   other
32   and no place to
33   go.


34   you get in the car
35   and you drive to work
36   and there are more strangers there, most of them
37   wives and husbands of somebody
38   else, and besides the guillotine of work, they
39   flirt and joke and pinch, sometimes tend to
40   work off a quick screw somewhere---
41   they can't do it at home---
42   and then
43   the drive back home
44   waiting for Christmas or Labor Day or
45   Sunday or
46   something.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /a night of Mozart/ [from The Days Run Away
        Like Wild Horses Over the Hills (1969) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   They slit his pockets and shot him in his car,
2   eighteen hundred dollars split four ways,
3   and I used to see him at the track
4   watching the tote
5   and going the last-flick bullrush toward the window;
6   he never took a drink
7   and he never took a woman home with him,
8   and he never spoke to anyone,
9   and I never spoke to anyone either
10   except to order a drink
11   or if a hustler had good legs and ass
12   to let her know
13   over a scotch and water
14   that later would be o.k.;
15   what I am getting at is
16   that this guy was a pro,
17   it was a business with him,
18   he didn't come out to holler and get drunk
19   and get fucked---
20   he came out to /make it/ , which is better
21   than punching another man's timeclock;
22   when I saw him bullrushing the $50 window
23   late in the year
24   I knew he was making it much better than I;
25   the board had showed a lot of false flashes,
26   some nut with a roll was dropping in one or two grand
27   at the last minute, but this guy was just that,
28   a nut with money, and we finally had to go through
29   the routine of finding out what he was betting
30   and flushing the horse out
31   before we got our bets down; this made one sweaty

[Page 89 ]


32   late bullrush ... anyhow, the quiet one didn't
33   worry about this and always laid his bet a little ahead
34   of time and walked off; he kept getting better,
35   his clothes looked better, he looked calmer,
36   and you could see him off to the side,
37   after most races, shoving bills into his wallet,
38   and Jeanette, one of the better hustlers, said,
39   "I'd start him off with a blow-job and then twist
40   his nuts until he told me how he did it ..."
41   "Would you do that to me, baby?" I asked.
42   "With your method of play you're lucky to have
43   admission," she said downing a drink that had cost me
44   85¢. "Do you still have a collection of Mozart?"
45   I asked her. "What's that got to do with it?" she asked.
46   I walked off.


47   I read about it in the papers next day. Witnesses
48   said there were 3 of them and a woman at the wheel.
49   I saw Jeanette at the bar. "Hello, Mozart," she said.
50   She looked a little nervous and at the same time she
51   seemed to feel pretty good. "I'll take a double
52   shot right now," I said. "And after the next race,
53   I think I'll have a vodka. I'm going to mix them all day.
54   Haven't
55   been real drunk in a couple of years."


56   She watched me lighting a cigarette, then I told her, "Also, I
57   want a pack of smokes, and you are going home with me
58   tonight and
59   we are going to listen to Mozart all night. You are going to
60   like it. You are going to have to like it."


61   She paid for the drink. "You're looking for trouble," she told
62   me. "Bitch," I said, "I have been trying to commit suicide
63   for
64   years."

[Page 90 ]




65   I had a good day. We went home and listened to Mozart for
66   hours.
67   She was as good as ever on the springs. Only this time there
68   was
69   no charge. Then she cried half the night and said she loved
70   me.
71   I knew what that was for.


72   The next afternoon at the track I didn't speak to her, and
73   I won
74   one hundred and twelve dollars, not counting drinks and
75   admission,
76   and I kept looking back through the rearview window as
77   I drove,
78   bigtime, and then I began to laugh, shit, they knew I was
79   nothing,
80   I was safe; I should tell the screws but when a man is dead
81   the screws can't bring him back.


82   I got home and opened a fifth of scotch, tired of Mozart
83   I tried /The Rake's Progress/ by Strav.
84   I read the Racing Form for about 30 minutes, put in a long
85   distance
86   call to some woman in Sacramento, drank a little more and
87   went to
88   bed, alone, about 11:30.

1   I sit up in bed at night and listen to you
2   snore
3   I met you in a bus station
4   and now I wonder at your back
5   sick white and stained with
6   children's freckles
7   as the lamp divests the unsolvable
8   sorrow of the world
9   upon your sleep.


10   I cannot see your feet
11   but I must guess that they are
12   most charming feet.


13   who do you belong to?
14   are you real?
15   I think of flowers, animals, birds
16   they all seem more than good
17   and so clearly
18   real.


19   yet you cannot help being a
20   woman. we are each selected to be
21   something. the spider, the cook.
22   the elephant. it is as if we were each
23   a painting and hung on some
24   gallery wall.


25   ---and now the painting turns
26   upon its back, and over a curving elbow
27   I can see ½ a mouth, one eye and

[Page 92 ]


28   almost a nose.
29   the rest of you is hidden
30   out of sight
31   but I know that you are a
32   contemporary, a modern living
33   work
34   perhaps not immortal
35   but we have
36   loved.


37   please continue to
38   snore.

1   the snake had crawled the hole,
2   and she said,
3   tell me about
4   yourself.


5   and
6   I said,
7   I was beaten down
8   long ago
9   in some alley
10   in another
11   world.


12   and she said,
13   we're all
14   like pigs
15   slapped down some lane,
16   our
17   grassbrains
18   singing
19   toward the

1   it is a page of reptiles, green pink fuchsia
2   slime motif
3   sexual organs
4   lips teeth fangs
5   in the grass of my brain
6   bringing down 1917 Spads,
7   games with toy cars
8   in a boy's backyard;
9   and eggs eggs eggs
10   of the hognose snake
11   she circles them in the sun,
12   life is an electric whip,
13   and ha!---the copperhead
14   he looks about, tiny brain
15   in the air searching
16   a wiseness as small as
17   seething to stroke a death;
18   and the horned toad:
19   fat little shitter in
20   fake armour
21   he blinks blinks
22   blinks in the sun
23   watching the flies
24   he is a tired old man
25   beyond hardly caring---
26   he just looks and waits
27   very dry
28   (wanting storm)
29   powerless
30   (without desire for)
31   ungifted he

[Page 96 ]


32   waits to be eaten;
33   and the gila monster
34   and the collared lizard,
35   the box turtle,
36   the chuckwalla,
37   here they go along the page,
38   and through rock and cacti
39   I suppose they are beautiful
40   in their slow horror,
41   and at the bottom
42   an alligator puts his eye upon me
43   and we look
44   he and I; he breathes and hungers
45   on a flat dream, and so
46   this is the way we will be spread
47   across the page,---
48   teeth, title, poesy,
49   alligator heart,
50   as the sky falls down.

1   I saw them
2   sitting in the lamplight and
3   I went in
4   and
5   he talked
6   waving his hands
7   jesus
8   his face was red
9   and
10   he talked
11   he wanted to be
12   right
13   he waved his hands
14   but when I left
15   he just sat there
16   and
17   she sat there
18   in the chair across from him
19   and
20   I got into my car
21   and backed out the drive
22   and
23   left them there
24   to do
25   whatever
26   they wanted to
27   do.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /did I ever tell you?/ [from The Days Run
        Away Like Wild Horses Over the Hills (1969) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   Did I ever tell you
2   about the damn fool who
3   liked to make love
4   in front of a
5   picture window?


6   And there was the one
7   who took the phonograph back,
8   and the one who
9   broke the lampshades
10   and the one with the
11   little golden hairs on his
12   chest.


13   And the one
14   on the kitchen floor,
15   and the one who
16   hunted for the mouth
17   of the Orinoco River.


18   And the tall one who
19   became a forest ranger
20   and left a note with Roger
21   confessing he was queer
22   (but Roger already knew).


23   Then there's the communist---he's in
24   Canada
25   or Florida, only I think
26   he's somebody else under this other
27   name, and I have a photo of him

[Page 99 ]


28   crawling out of a rowboat;
29   he has lovely gray hair and his face
30   is sort of blue
31   and he writes these
32   long love letters.


33   And Edward was a queer---but so very gentle;
34   he lit candles, had a sense of humor and
35   very hairy legs---like one of those land
36   crabs
37   or a coconut.


38   And Jerry was just like a horse---
39   if I looked him in the eye
40   he couldn't
41   kiss me.
42   (He just pretended he was gay
43   but he wasn't.)
44   (I can tell. Oh, I can always tell.)


45   Then there was my desert
46   romance---I really don't like to tell
47   about it, but since you /asked/ ---
48   I think he really
49   loved me.
50   I got drunk and
51   fell off my horse
52   and broke my
53   arm
54   when we tried to jump a fence
55   riding double-saddle
56   and his wife threatened to
57   kill me
58   so
59   I
60   left town.

[Page 100 ]




61   I used to go up on the
62   roof with Manny.
63   He was strange.
64   Parents spoiled him.
65   We looked at the moon through
66   a telescope: I stood
67   at the big end
68   and held it up
69   and he sat down
70   at the little end
71   and looked through it.


72   And Carl has my /Drama/
73   /Through the Ages, from/
74   /Euripides to Miller/ .
75   (I must write him for it. You
76   won't mind?) That Carl---


77   it was my birthday
78   and I came in
79   and he was out
80   cold drunk
81   on the sofa
82   and I threw
83   some flowers at him
84   (vase and all)
85   and he stood up
86   and showed me the tiniest
87   gold bracelet
88   in a little felt box,
89   and I cried.
90   (Oh yes, I loved him. I really
91   loved him---he was so kind,
92   and he was always writing mother---

[Page 101 ]


93   "Where's Rita at, please tell me!"
94   but mother
95   never told him.)


96   Then there was that old bastard German
97   they never know when to give it up.
98   He was bald and I hated him,
99   he looked like a sick frog
100   and his breath was bad,
101   but the funniest thing
102   was all this hair on
103   his belly. I could never
104   figure it.
105   He had plenty of money
106   but he was married,
107   the old bastard,
108   and he told me
109   he loved me,
110   and he hired me as a
111   secretary,
112   he was always playing around,
113   the old bastard,
114   and I finally ran away,
115   though I /could/ have taken him
116   from his wife
117   but I couldn't stand the old
118   bastard.


119   Vincent?
120   No. He was nothing. He was frightened
121   of his brother.
122   "My brother!" he'd scream
123   and we'd all run out the back door
124   and into the garage naked
125   or just in panties and bras.
126   I made curtains for his house

[Page 102 ]


127   and he called me daughter
128   and I cooked for him
129   and he wrote everything in a little
130   black book and wore a sailing cap.
131   He dropped money on the floor
132   and played the organ ...
133   wrote an opera for Organ
134   called the /Emperor of San Francisco/ .
135   But I liked him mainly because
136   he knew the kids,
137   drove me to Newman once to meet them,
138   and once, before he got real tight
139   he sent me money
140   when I was stranded in the islands.


141   And Gus---he was just like a father to me---
142   I knew him so long.
143   I met him in the islands
144   when I was stranded.
145   I think he saved my life.
146   I got fired for being caught in the
147   barracks.
148   But he understood.
149   Oh, I know you don't like him,
150   but he's so /understanding/ .
151   And when Vincent sent the money
152   we both came stateside.
153   He said he wanted to marry me
154   but he had to take care of his
155   mother
156   who had some kind of
157   lifelong disease.
158   He's always running back to
159   those islands,
160   so completely lost,
161   utterly lost.

[Page 103 ]


162   You'd hardly know him now.
163   He's stopped drinking
164   and weighs 297,
165   (and he kissed just like you,
166   and had little wires in his left
167   leg, but he'd never tell me ...


168   ... and the chauffeur
169   walked into the room
170   with a basket
171   with a live chicken
172   in it. This guy grabbed the chicken
173   around the neck
174   and whirled it
175   around and around
176   and you should have heard
177   that chicken scream
178   and then he cut it with a knife
179   and the blood
180   flew like rain
181   and this guy
182   played his piccolo
183   and watched my eyes,
184   and that's all that happened,
185   even though he had made me
186   take off my dress.
187   He gave me $25
188   but somehow
189   the whole thing
190   made me sick.


191   Nicholas was a queer
192   and impotent,
193   and he was my lover.
194   He still has my
195   e.e. cummings.

[Page 104 ]


196   The first one was insane.
197   He blew
198   through fig leaves
199   while sitting on the coffee table
200   his hands tangled in my hair.
201   He played the oboe
202   and you know what
203   they say about the oboe:
204   they took him away
205   from me
206   and he was like a child.
207   I gave the oboe to a ballet dancer
208   who broke his
209   leg on
210   a camp stool
211   while
212   hiking
213   in the Adirondacks.


214   I was engaged to Arlington
215   only three weeks.
216   And he tore the ring from my finger
217   claiming he didn't
218   want to marry the whole
219   queer army.
220   Later he cried on my shoulder
221   and told me he was a queen bee
222   and a general
223   and that he had been kidding himself
224   all his life.
225   I cried when he left.


226   Ralph was the only one, I think,
227   who ever loved me,
228   but he didn't appreciate the finer
229   things:

[Page 105 ]


230   he thought that Van Gogh used to pitch for
231   Brooklyn and that George Sand played
232   opposite Zsa Zsa Gabor.
233   And when he sent money from East Lansing
234   I bought a hi-fi set and a toy bull
235   with blue eyes
236   and called him Keithy-pot.
237   I sent Ralph a pressed azalea and a photo
238   of me
239   bending over
240   in a bikini.


241   Sherman was afraid of the dark.
242   He died swallowing a
243   cherry seed. Roger---I've told
244   you
245   about him; Roger started
246   a good story once
247   but he never finished it.
248   It was about a queer
249   sitting at a table
250   at a night club
251   and these people came up---
252   but, oh, I can't explain it.


253   Peter will kill himself some day.
254   Art will kill himself.
255   Tommy set fire to the bed and
256   beat his mother. I only
257   lived with him
258   because of her. We went
259   to Alkaseltzer Mass
260   together. Once he
261   hit her when she
262   got off the streetcar.

[Page 106 ]


263   Then he hit me. I hated him,
264   but she was like a mother to me.
265   And then I met you.


266   Remember that Sunday at
267   the Round Duck?
268   You said,
269   let's go to
270   Mexico.
271   And you took me up
272   to your place
273   and read Erle Stanley Gardner
274   and then you hung out
275   the window.
276   You looked like my father.
277   You should have known my father.
278   He was a drunkard.


279   Oh, I'm so glad I met you.
280   You make me
281   feel so
282   good. Darling /you/ are a
283   man.
284   The only real
285   MAN
286   I've /ever/ known!
287   Oh dear, how I've
288   waited!
289   My hands are cold and
290   you have the /funniest/
291   feet!


292   I love you ...

1   the best way to think is not at all---
2   my banjo screams in the brush
3   like a trapped rabbit (do rabbits
4   scream? never mind: this is an
5   alcoholic dream);
6   machine guns, I say,
7   the altarboys,
8   the wet nurses,
9   the fat newsboys,
10   rubber-lipped delegates
11   of the precious life;
12   my banjo screams
13   sing
14   sing through the darkened dream,
15   green grow green,
16   take gut:
17   death, at last,
18   is no headache.

1   long walks at
2   night---
3   that's what's good
4   for the
5   soul:
6   peeking into windows
7   watching tired
8   housewives
9   trying to fight
10   off
11   their beer-maddened
12   husbands.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /the sharks/ [from The Days Run Away Like

1   the sharks knock on my door
2   and enter and ask favors;
3   how they puff in my chairs
4   looking about the room,
5   and they ask for deeds:
6   light, air, money,
7   anything they can get---
8   beer, cigarettes, half dollars, dollars,
9   fives, dimes,
10   all this as if my survival were assured,
11   as if my time were nothing
12   and their presence valuable.


13   well, we all have our sharks, I'm sure,
14   and there's only one way to get them off
15   before they hack and nibble you to death---
16   stop feeding them; they will find
17   other bait; you fattened them
18   the last dozen times around---
19   now set them out
20   to sea.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /fag, fag, fag/ [from The Days Run Away

1   he wrote,
2   you are a humorless ass,
3   I was only pulling your leg about D.
4   joining the Foreign Legion, and
5   D. is about as much fag as
6   Winston Churchill.


7   hmm, I thought, I am in contact with the
8   greatest minds of my
9   generation. clever! Winnie is dead so he
10   can't be a
11   fag.


12   the letter continued,
13   you guys in California are fag-happy,
14   all you do is sit around and think about
15   fags. just the same I will send you the anti-war
16   materials I and others wrote, although I
17   doubt it will stop the
18   war.


19   10 years ago he had sent me a photo of
20   D. and himself at a picnic ground.
21   D. was dressed in a Foreign Legion uniform,
22   there was a bottle of wine,
23   and a table with one tableleg
24   crooked.


25   I thought it over for 10 years and then
26   answered:

[Page 111 ]




27   I have nothing against 2 men sleeping together
28   so long as I am not one of those 2
29   men.


30   I didn't infer which one was the
31   fag.


32   anyway, today I got the anti-war materials
33   in the mail, but he's right:
34   it won't stop the war or anything
35   else.

/(for J.B. who never read the stuff)/



1   the bones of my uncle
2   rode a motorcycle in Arcadia
3   and raped a housewife
4   within a garage
5   hung with rakes and hoses
6   the bones of my Uncle
7   left behind
8   1: a jar of peanut butter
9   and
10   2: two girls named
11   Katherine &
12   Betsy and
13   3: a ragged wife who cried
14   continually.
15   the bones of my Uncle
16   played horses
17   too
18   and
19   made counterfeit money---
20   mostly dimes, and the F.B.I. wanted him for
21   something more serious
22   although what it was
23   I have since
24   forgotten.
25   the bones of my Uncle
26   stretched the long way
27   seemed too short
28   and looked at

29   coming toward you
30   bent like bows
31   beneath the knees.


32   the bones of my Uncle
33   smoked and cussed
34   and they were buried
35   where bones are buried
36   who have no
37   money.


38   I almost forgot to tell you:
39   his bones were named "John"
40   and
41   had green eyes
42   which did not
43   last.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /a last shot on two good horses/ [from The
        Days Run Away Like Wild Horses Over the Hills (1969) , Black
        Sparrow Press ]



1   it was about 10 years ago at Hollywood Park---
2   I had a shackjob, 2 cars, a house, a dog as big as Nero
3   drunk,
4   and I was making it with the horses, or I thought I was,
5   but going into the 7th race I was down to my last $50
6   and I put the $50 on Determine and then I wanted a cup
7   of coffee
8   but I only had a dime left and coffee was then 15¢.


9   I went into the crapper and I wanted to flush myself away,
10   they had me, all I had left was that piece of paper in my
11   wallet,
12   and I would have been willing to sell that back for $40
13   but I was ashamed. well, I went out and watched the race
14   and Determine won.


15   I collected and set aside a ten and put the remainder all on
16   My Boy Bobby. My Boy Bobby made it. I collected and
17   stood over in
18   a corner, separating the 50s and the 20s and tens and fives,
19   and then I drove on in, I gave her the thumb up as I drove
20   up the drive,
21   and when I got inside I threw all the money up into the air.


22   She was a beautiful whore and her eyes almost came out
23   when she saw
24   that, and the dog ran in and snatched a ten and ran into the
25   kitchen,
26   and I was pouring drinks and she said, "hey, the hound got
27   a tenner!"
28   and I said, "hell, let him have it!" we drank 'em down.

[Page 117 ]


29   then I said, "umm, I think I'll get that ten anyhow," and I
30   walked in
31   and took it from him, it was only chewed a little, and that
32   night
33   on the bed she showed me all the tricks in wonderland, and
34   later
35   it rained and we listened to Carmen and drank and laughed
36   all night long.


37   days and nights like that just don't happen too often.

1   I haven't slept
2   for 3 nights
3   or 3 days
4   and my eyes are more
5   red than white;
6   I laugh in the
7   mirror,
8   and I have been
9   listening to the clock
10   tick
11   and the gas
12   of my heater
13   smells
14   a hot thick
15   heavy
16   smell, run
17   through with the sounds
18   of cars,
19   cars strung up
20   like ornaments
21   in my head, but
22   I have read
23   the classics
24   and on my couch
25   sleeps a wine-soaked
26   whore
27   who for the first
28   time
29   has heard
30   Beethoven's 9th,

        [from The Days Run Away Like Wild Horses Over the Hills (1969) ,
        Black Sparrow Press ]



1   life on paper is so much more
2   pleasurable:
3   there are no bombs or flies or
4   landlords or starving
5   cats,
6   and I am in the kitchen
7   staring down at the blue lake of the
8   concertmaster
9   and also the trees
10   rowboats, boy with American flag
11   lady in yellow with fan
12   Civil War veteran
13   girl with balloon
14   spotted dog
15   sailboat,
16   the peace of an ancient day
17   with the sun dreaming old
18   battles---
19   John L. Sullivan emptying the pint
20   in his dressing room
21   and getting ready to whip the world like a
22   bad child---
23   far from our modern life
24   where a doctor sticks something in your side,
25   saying, "is something making you nervous? something is
26   killing you."


27   I open the matchbox, take out a beautiful wooden match
28   and light a cigar.

[Page 124 ]


29   I look out the window. it is raining. there will be nothing
30   in the park today except bums and madmen.
31   I blow the smoke against the wet glass and wonder what I
32   am doing
33   inside here
34   dry and dying and
35   I hear the rain as a toilet flushes through the wall
36   (a living neighbor)
37   and the flowers open their arms for love.


38   I sit down next to the lady in yellow with the fan and
39   she smiles at me
40   and we talk we talk
41   only I can't hear for all the music
42   "your name? your name?" I keep asking
43   but she only smiles at me
44   and the dog is howling.


45   but yellow is my favorite color
46   (Van Gogh liked it too)
47   yellow
48   and I do not blow smoke in her face
49   and I am there
50   I am actually down there in the matchbox
51   and I am here too.


52   she smiles
53   and I lay her right on the
54   stove
55   and it is
56   hot
57   hot
58   the American flag waves in
59   battle---
60   play your music concertmaster

[Page 125 ]


61   in your red coat
62   with your hot July buttocks.


63   the balloon pops and I walk across a kitchen
64   on a rainy day in February
65   to check on eggs and bread and
66   wine and sanity


67   to check on glue
68   to paste nice pictures
69   on these walls.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /bad night/ [from The Days Run Away Like
        Wild Horses Over the Hills (1969) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   I am fairly drunk and there is a man jumping
2   up and down on the floor in his shack next door
3   he's rough on the floorboards and I listen to his
4   dance while my wife is in the can and Fidelio is on
5   our radio, and today at the track I lost $70 and a woman
6   got her foot caught in the escalator, and the drunks
7   hollered at the usher: REVERSE IT! THROW IT IN
8   REVERSE! meanwhile, the red blood and the gamblers
9   and
10   myself watching the tote for a meaningful flash and I
11   dumped it in
12   the wrong place.
13   now the man has stopped jumping on the floor and
14   has opened his bible. well, it has been a bad
15   summer for all of us. a particular feeling
16   a flailing feeling of too much. we are shocked
17   almost senseless with the demand to put on our
18   socks, we hang like paintings of blue-skinned
19   virgins before young boys in dementia, & it's
20   too much hair on the neck and flowers dying in a
21   bowl. my wife comes out of the
22   can.
23   are you all right? she
24   asks. yeah, I
25   say.


[Page 127 ]




        Bukowski, Charles :  /down by the wings/ [from The Days Run Away
        Like Wild Horses Over the Hills (1969) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   they speak of angels or she
2   speaks of angels
3   from a plateglass window overlooking the
4   Sunset Strip
5   (she has these visions)
6   (I don't have these visions)
7   but maybe angels prefer people with
8   money
9   daughters of rich farmers who are dying of
10   throat cancer in Brazil.
11   myself---I keep seeing these
12   wingless creatures of mean story and dismal
13   intent
14   and she says
15   when I defame her
16   dream:
17   you are trying to
18   pull me down
19   by the wings.


20   she's going to Europe in the summer---
21   Greece, Italy, most probably
22   Paris and she's
23   taking some of her angels with
24   her.
25   not all
26   but some.
27   now there's this half-Chinese boy who used to
28   sleep on fire escapes
29   the Negro homosexual who plays chess and
30   recited Shelley at the Sensualist

[Page 128 ]


31   then there's the one who has real talent with the
32   brush (Nickey) but who simply can't get
33   started
34   somehow and
35   there's also Sieberling who cries because he
36   loves his mother (actually).


37   many of these
38   angels
39   will leave town and
40   flow around the
41   Arch of Triumph
42   to be photographed or
43   to chase beetles at
44   9 rue Git-le-Coeur, and
45   it's going to be a hot and
46   lonesome summer
47   for many of us when
48   the devil walks in and retakes Hollywood
49   once more.

2   came


3   sparrows flew away and fat landlords parted from their
4   electric mirrors


5   skinny housewives with runny noses and dirty aprons
6   came


7   and the fire engine: polished wailing disorder spilling
8   intestines of water
9   came


10   firemen in helmets
11   firemen with axes
12   came


13   god, a tree 90 feet high
14   BURNING

16   tolling
17   lordward
18   the grass melting and yelling on the top of the
19   ground and
20   those smokesweet pictures of bluegray putting the
21   whole sky out of
22   place


23   and all the while nobody saying anything just
24   watching
25   what the flames did

26   like something busted out

        Bukowski, Charles :  /one for the old man/ [from The Days Run
        Away Like Wild Horses Over the Hills (1969) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   standing in the plaza I can hear speeches about a new
2   world---
3   men asking for their kind of love
4   while mine is a kind of pinch-eyed drag of
5   going on, for that which seems so important to them
6   seems worthless to me.
7   so
8   I go back to the hotel room
9   and look at the pitcher of water on the dresser
10   and the bits of glass hung on string
11   left in the window by a Mexican whore
12   to reflect what's left of me
13   and this seems
14   sensible
15   as sensible as reading the history of the
16   Crimean War
17   as sensible as wax and women and
18   dogs.
19   I watch a fly and read the newspaper
20   then eat sausage and bananas
21   and an orange.


22   then I pull the shade on the speechmakers.
23   over the back of a chair are my
24   belt and necktie,
25   necktie knotted
26   for my throat
27   which is like a flower 80 feet high and
28   pumping out phrases of
29   bedlam.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /a drawer of fish/ [from The Days Run Away
        Like Wild Horses Over the Hills (1969) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   he kept drawing fish
2   on sheets of paper
3   and I said,
4   Jack, what's wrong?
5   but he wouldn't answer
6   and his wife said
7   he won't look for a job
8   that's what's wrong,
9   and I gotta stay with
10   the kids; I don't know
11   how in the hell we're
12   going to make it.


13   he kept drawing fish
14   on sheets of paper
15   and he wasn't even drunk.


16   I went down and got 2
17   bottles of wine
18   and the old lady poured
19   them around.


20   and Jack drank his,
21   then cursed: this g.d.
22   ballpoint pen always runs
23   out of blood
24   just when I'm at the point,
25   the crux, just when I'm
26   finally burning
27   in the imbecile wax of fire ...

[Page 134 ]




28   he threw the pen
29   into a papersack full of empty bottles,
30   empty sardine and
31   bean cans, put on his coat
32   and walked out.


33   where's he going?
34   I asked.


35   I don't give a damn
36   where's he's going,
37   his old lady said.
38   then she pulled her dress back
39   and showed me a lot of leg;
40   it looked pretty good, I
41   have always been a leg man
42   but I walked over to the closet
43   and put on my coat.


44   where you going? she asked.


45   I'm going to look for a job,
46   I told her,
47   there's an ad in the Times,
48   they need janitors for the
49   new Fleischman building.


50   I walked down the steps
51   and half a block North
52   to the nearest bar.


53   Jack was sitting there.


54   I don't know, he said,
55   I think I'm going
56   to kill myself.

[Page 135 ]




57   it doesn't matter, I said,
58   it's going to happen
59   anyhow.


60   we sat there the rest of the afternoon
61   drinking
62   and about 7 p.m. we left,
63   he with one with fire in her hair
64   and I with one with a limp
65   a reader of Henry James
66   who laughed out of the side
67   of her mouth.


68   it was 63 degrees
69   and not much left
70   of the world.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /L. Beethoven, half-back/ [from The Days
        Run Away Like Wild Horses Over the Hills (1969) , Black Sparrow
        Press ]



1   he came out for the team;
2   Ludwig V. Beethoven, blocking
3   half-back. he really knocked
4   them down. but he drank beer
5   and played the piano all night.
6   Schiller, you're a freak, he
7   said. leave the ladies alone.
8   the ladies will always be the
9   same. don't fret, when you
10   need one, she'll be there.


11   and Tchaikovsky, he said,
12   take some vitamins. I don't
13   mind that you're a homo:
14   just stay away
15   from me. that's the trouble
16   with all you guys:
17   you're too
18   pale!


19   I took a lateral from G. B. Shaw
20   and ducked around the end;
21   Beethoven blocked out 3 men,
22   and as I went past
23   he said, I got a couple of
24   babes lined up for tonight;
25   don't injure
26   anything
27   you might need
28   later ...

[Page 137 ]




29   I shot up the field
30   evading tacklers
31   like a madman. B. was
32   studying harmony, but
33   I doubted if he could
34   ever
35   make it. he was just
36   a fat
37   beer-drinking

1   my snake's red fingers
2   he said
3   and they took him off the couch
4   and put him on the stretcher
5   and carried him down
6   25 steps
7   and his woman crossed her legs
8   (I could almost see her beautiful crotch)
9   and lit a cigarette
10   and said
11   I just
12   can't /kaant/ see what possessed him,
13   and I slapped her across the face
14   flying the cigarette to the rug
15   like some Mars thing
16   and followed the stretcher
17   on down.

        Bukowski, Charles :  /these mad windows that taste life and cut
        me if I go through them/ [from The Days Run Away Like Wild
        Horses Over the Hills (1969) , Black Sparrow Press ]



1   I've always lived on second and third floors or higher
2   all my life
3   but I got some woman pregnant
4   and since she wasn't my wife
5   we moved over here---
6   we were in the back at first
7   2nd floor rear
8   as Mr. and Mrs.---
9   a new start---
10   and there was a madwoman in this
11   place and she kept the shades drawn
12   and hollered obscenities in the dark
13   (I thought she was pretty sharp)
14   but they took her away one day
15   and we moved in here and had the baby,
16   a beautiful skunk of a child with pale blue eyes
17   who made me swallow my heart like a cherry in a
18   chilled drink,
19   but the woman decided I was insane too
20   and moved the child and herself to Hollywood
21   and I give them what money I can---
22   but most of the time I lay around all day
23   sweating in bed
24   wondering how much longer I can fool them
25   listening to my landlord outside
26   watering his lawn
27   46 years hanging on my bones
28   and big green tears cascade ha, ha,
29   down my face and are tabulated by my dirty pillow:
30   all those years shot through the head

[Page 140 ]


31   assassinated forever
32   drunk senseless
33   hobbled and slugged in factories
34   poked with bad dreams
35   dripping away in mouse- and ghost-infested rooms
36   across an America without meaning,
37   boy o boy.


38   about 3 p.m. I get up
39   having failed to sleep but more than a few minutes
40   anyhow
41   and then I put on an old undershirt
42   crisp fresh torn shorts
43   and a pair of stolen army pants
44   and I pull up the shades
45   and sit a little back in a hard folding chair
46   near a window on the streetside
47   and then they come by,
48   young girls
49   fresh fluid divine intelligent
50   drinks of orange juice
51   rides in air-conditioned elevators,
52   in blue and green and yellow in motion
53   in red in waves
54   in squads and battalions of laughter
55   they laugh at me and for me,
56   old 46, at attention, pig green eyes
57   like a Van Gogh bursting and breaking
58   the trachea and tits of the earth and the sun,
59   my god, look, here I am
60   and no matter what I said to them
61   they would run away
62   I would be reported as an old goof
63   babbling in the marketplace for hard pennies---
64   they expect me to use the bathroom,
65   a shadow-picture for their singing flesh

[Page 141 ]


66   and the pliers of my hand---
67   a good citizen jacksoff, votes, and looks at Bob Hope---
68   and even old maids
69   with husbands killed
70   making swivel chairs in industry
71   they walk by
72   in green in yellow in red
73   and they have bodies like high-school girls
74   they perch on their stilts and dare me to break
75   custom


76   but to have any of these would take weeks and months
77   of torture---introduction, niceties, conversation that
78   cleaves the soul like a rusty axe---
79   no, no, god damn it! no more!


80   a man who cannot adjust to society is called a
81   psychotic, and the boy in the Texas tower
82   who shot 49 and killed 15 was one,
83   although in the Marine Corps he got the o.k.
84   to go ahead---it's all in the way you're dressed
85   and if the beehive says the project
86   protects the Queen and Goodyear Rubber and so
87   forth,
88   but the way I see it from this window
89   his action was nothing extraordinary or
90   unexpected and psychiatrists are just paid liars
91   of a continuing social
92   disorder.


93   and soon I get up from the window
94   and move around
95   and if I turn on the radio
96   and luck on Shostakovich or Mahler
97   or sit down to type a letter to the president,
98   the voices begin all around me---

[Page 142 ]




99   "HEY! KNOCK IT OFF!"
100   "YOU SON OF A BITCH! WE'LL CALL THE LAW!"


101   on each side of me are two high-rise apartments
102   things lit at night with blue and green lights
103   and they have swimming pools that everybody has
104   too much class to get into
105   but the rent is very high
106   and they sit looking at their walls
107   decorated with pictures of people with chopped-off
108   heads
109   and wait to go back to
110   WORK,
111   meanwhile, they sense that my sounds are not
112   their sounds---
113   66 people on each side of my head
114   in love with Green Berets and piranhas---
115   "GOD DAMN YOU, COOL IT!"


116   these I cannot see through my window
117   and for this I am glad
118   my stomach is in bad shape from drinking cheap wine,
119   and so for them
120   I become quiet
121   I listen to their sounds---
122   their baseball games, their comedies, their quiz shows,
123   their dry kisses, their kindling safety,
124   their hard bodies stuffed into the walls and murdered,
125   and I go to the table
126   take my madman's crayons
127   and begin drawing them on my walls
128   all of them---
129   loving, fucking, eating, shitting,
130   frightened of Christ, frightened of poverty,
131   frightened of life
132   they crawl my walls like roaches

[Page 143 ]


133   and I draw suns between them
134   and axes and guns and towers and babies
135   and dogs, cats, animals, and it becomes
136   difficult to distinguish the animal from the
137   other, and my whole body sweats, stinks,
138   as I tremble like a liar from the truth of things,
139   and then I drink some water, take off my clothing and
140   go to bed
141   where I will not sleep
142   first pulling down all the shades
143   and then waiting for 3 p.m.
144   my girls my ladies my way
145   with nothing going through and nothing coming in and
146   nothing going out, Cathedrals and Art Museums and
147   mountains wasted, only the salt of myself, some ants,
148   old newspapers, my shame, my shame
149   at not having
150   killed
151   (razor, carcrash, turpentine, gaspipe)
152   (good job, marriage, investments in the market)
153   what is left of
154   myself.

        I.



1   reading the Dialogues of Plato when the
2   doctor walks up and says


3   do you still read that highbrow
4   stuff? last time I read that I
5   was in
6   high school.


7   I read it, I tell
8   him.


9   well, it's a girl, 9#, 3 oz. no trouble at
10   all.


11   shit. great. when can I see
12   them?


13   they'll let you know. good
14   night.


        II.


15   I sit down to Plato again. there are 4 people playing
16   cards. one woman has beautiful legs that she doesn't hide
17   and I keep looking at her legs until she covers them with a
18   blue sweater.

[Page 145 ]



        III.



19   I am called upstairs. they show me the thing through glass.
20   it's red as a boiled crab and tough. it will make
21   it. it will see it through.


22   hey, look at this, Plato: /another broad!/
23   I can see her now on some Sunday afternoon
24   shaking it in a tight skirt
25   making boulevards of young men warble in their
26   guts.


27   I wave the girl and the nurse
28   away.


        IV.



29   the woman is still stunned with
30   drugs but I tell her


31   a great woman has arrived!
32   and make my fists into little balls and I
33   hold up my arms and
34   snarl-cry.


35   the nurse is fat and Mexican, has eaten too many
36   tortillas.


37   nice to have met you, sweetheart, I
38   tell her.


        V.



39   then I am back at the shack. I sit down and listen to
40   the bathtub drip.

[Page 146 ]




41   I go over and pull all the blinds down and fall on the
42   couch. all I can hear is tires on
43   steel streets.


        VI.


44   there is a /meeow/ from the screen and I let him
45   in: sober, indifferent,
46   hungry.


        VII.



47   we walk into the kitchen
48   male, swaggering under the electric light;
49   4 balls, 2 heads
50   dominion over all the continent
51   over ships that sail in and out
52   over small female things and jewels.


53   I get down the can of
54   cat food and open
55   it. Plato is left in the
56   glove compartment.

        recite? can you be there at nine?/ [from The Days Run Away Like

1   ... and all they know is kill, these pungent insects,
2   and as we whirl in new worlds
3   I am filled with space and I
4   am ill; I roll a child's marble
5   upon the rug, then hear it
6   clatter off into some new corner
7   and I puke as the telephone rings;
8   MR. SPANISH, A VOICE SAYS, WE WANT
9   YOU TO SPEAK BEFORE THE
10   SOCIETY. WE FEEL IT WILL BE
11   VITAL. I hang up, of course,
12   and I find an orange
13   in the icebox, but before
14   I can peel it and eat it
15   I am ill again.
16   and
17   I take off
18   and fold my shoes, sit down cross-
19   legged, (like a statue I wish I
20   owned), and wait, at 3 p.m.,
21   to die.

1   down at the end of the bar
2   he used to bum
3   drinks, now he is a balding man and
4   I lean close:
5   you are the finest poet
6   of our age, you are the
7   only one that everybody
8   understands ...


9   we drink coffee, we sit in his small
10   poorly furnished house, his oil paintings
11   are on the walls. I am going to give him
12   money, paper, paint, a better
13   typewriter. he is going to give me some
14   original
15   manuscripts.


16   I look at him and sense that he fears
17   me. he coughs, his stomach must feel
18   oily, dense,
19   ill.


20   I tell him:
21   I know all about you:
22   you had a cruel Spanish
23   stepfather, you lived with
24   numerous whores, drank yourself
25   senseless,
26   starved ...

[Page 149 ]


27   yeah, he
28   says.


29   I lean closer:
30   in my own quiet way,
31   I am a worshipper of
32   heroes ...


33   when I leave with his manuscripts (signed)
34   and one of his oils plus
35   3 wire-coiled and unreadable
36   notebooks
37   he doesn't come to the door with me. there is a
38   mirror and he sits looking into the
39   mirror and he
40   bows his head, ashamed and
41   finished.


42   "The Artist," an ancient sage had once said,
43   "is always sitting on the doorsteps of the
44   rich."


45   I swing into my caddy, throw the junk in the
46   back and
47   drive off.

1   Seivers was one of the hardest running backs since
2   Jimmy Brown, and lateral motion too,
3   like a chorus girl, really, until one day he got hit on
4   the blind side by Basil Skronski; we carried Seivers off the
5   field
6   but Skronski had gotten one rib and cracked another.


7   the next year Seivers wasn't even good in practice, gun shy
8   as a
9   squirrel in deer season; he stopped contact, fumbled, couldn't
10   even
11   hold a look-in pass or a handoff---all that wasted and he
12   could go the 100 in 9.7.


13   I'm 45 years old, out of shape, too much beer, but one of
14   the best
15   assistant coaches in the pro game, and I can't stand to see a
16   man
17   jaking it. I got him in the locker room the other day when
18   the whole
19   squad was in there. I told him, "Seivers, you used to be a
20   player
21   but now you're chickenshit!"


22   "you can't talk that way to me, Manny!" he said, and I
23   turned him
24   around, he was lacing on a shoe, and I right-cracked him
25   right on the chin. he fell against a locker
26   and then he began to cry---the greatest since Brown,
27   crying there against the locker, one shoe off, one on.

[Page 151 ]




28   "come on, men, let's get outa here!" I told the gang, and
29   we ran
30   on out, and when we got back he had cleared out, he was
31   gone, his
32   gear was gone. we got some kid from Illinois running his
33   spot now,
34   head down, knees high, he don't care where's he's going.


35   guys like Seivers end up washing dishes for a buck an hour
36   and that's just what they deserve.

1   the phone rings and it is usually the woman with the
2   sexy voice from the phone company telling me
3   to please pay my phone bill,
4   but this time a voice says quietly,
5   "you son of a bitch,"
6   and it is the editor of a dozen magazines,
7   everything from religious pamphlets
8   to do-it-yourself abortions,
9   and he asks,
10   "why haven't you called?"
11   and I say, "we don't get along."
12   "catalysis," he says,
13   "dig?"
14   "dig," I say,
15   and then he tells me that he has seen me
16   in issue No. 5 of /Crablegs and Muletears/
17   and that I am getting better,
18   and I tell him that I am a slow starter
19   and being only 42
20   I still stand a chance to spread sand
21   in Abdulah's garden,
22   and he says come on over
23   I want you to meet a friend
24   and I tell him I will give him a ring
25   after the track ...


26   it is Saturday and hot
27   and the faces of greed rushing past
28   pinched and dried and impossible
29   want to make me kneel amongst the lilies and pray

[Page 153 ]


30   but instead I go to a bar
31   where I can get good vodka and orange for 70¢
32   and people keep talking to me,
33   it is one big lonely hearts club,
34   people lonely for a voice and a million dollars
35   and not getting much of either,
36   and by the 9th race I am one hundred dollars in the hole
37   and a big colored guy walks up to me
38   and spreads the tickets of the last winner in his hand
39   like violin music,
40   and I say
41   "fine, fine,"
42   and he says, "I am with a couple of old broads
43   and now they are trying to find me,
44   but I am ducking out, I am going to lock the doors
45   and get drunk."
46   "fine," I say, and he walks off
47   and I keep wondering why so many colored people
48   talk to me, and then I remembered
49   I was in a bar once and a big black guy swore me into
50   something called the Muslims;
51   I had to repeat a lot of fancy words and
52   we drank all night,
53   but I thought he was kidding:
54   I am not out to destroy all the white race---
55   only a small part of it:
56   myself.


57   "who you like?" another guy asks me
58   and I say "the 3rd horse," and he says
59   "the 3 is out," and walks off
60   and that is all I want to hear
61   and I put 20 to win on the 3,
62   get a screwdriver
63   and walk down to the last turn
64   where if you've been around long enough

[Page 154 ]


65   you can pick out the winner
66   before the stretch drive begins.
67   and I'm there when the 3 drives past
68   a length and a half behind the 6,
69   the others are out,
70   and it looks close, both are running hard
71   without signs of tiring
72   but I have to close the gap
73   and I look up at the board and see that
74   the 6 is 25-1 and I am only 7-1
75   and with a little luck I might make it,
76   and I did by three-quarters of a length
77   and the frogs of my mind lined up and
78   jumped over death (for a little while)
79   and I walked over and got my $166.


80   I was in the tub with a beer when the phone rang,
81   "bastard, where are you?"
82   it was the editor.
83   "see you in 30 minutes," I told him.
84   "I don't want any stuff outa you or I'll lay
85   you out," he tells me.
86   "fine," I say, "30 minutes then."
87   which gives me time for a couple more beers.


88   the place is in the back in South Hollywood,
89   a small cell with a water heater
90   in the bathroom, and a rack of books take up
91   half the room: much Huxley (Aldous), Lawrence
92   (not of Arabia), and a lot of tomes and vessels
93   of people halfway in the playground
94   between poetry and the novel
95   and lacking either the motivation or the discipline
96   to write straight philosophy,
97   and he had a woman in there

[Page 155 ]


98   in the last peach fuzz of her youth,
99   pale orange, a little spiritless,
100   but quiet, which was good,
101   and he said, "baby, get the man a beer,"
102   and I threw him my latest book
103   which I inscribed, "to a connoisseur
104   of vagina and verse ..."
105   and he said, "you are getting fat, bastard,
106   but you are looking better than the last time
107   I saw you."
108   "was that in Paris?" I asked.
109   "Pasadena, Calif.," he answered.
110   "Faulkner's dead now too," I said.
111   "how do you like the bitch?" he asked,
112   "look at her."
113   I looked at her and thanked her for the beer.
114   "fair stand the fields of France,"
115   I said.
116   "I need a hundred and a half," he told me.
117   "Jesus," I answered,
118   "I was just gonna ask you for the same thing."
119   "I hear Harry is back with his old lady."
120   "yeah. looking for a job. painting furniture. baby-sitting.
121   he was even a bartender one night."
122   "Harry? a /bartender?"/
123   "just for 3 hours. then he said he got tired."
124   "tired?"
125   " 'tired' is the word he used."
126   "I need a hundred and a half."
127   "who the hell doesn't?"
128   "Faulkner doesn't," he said.
129   "I wonder what he mixed in his drinks? I've got to slow
130   down ..."


131   the bitch had some poems she wrote and I read them
132   and they were not bad considering that she was built for

[Page 156 ]


133   other things, and the rest of the night was fairly dull,
134   no fist fights, too old to tango, tiger asleep in the shade,
135   and I promised I would write an essay ON THE MEANING
136   OF
137   MODERN POETRY which he promised to print unseen
138   and which I knew I would never write.
139   the night was full of promises, an old tiger
140   and a peach. I drove home down the side streets,
141   swinging wide around the police station,
142   smoking king-sized and humming parts from /Carmen/
143   because it was very dark and Bizet drove better than
144   Ludwig who had his mind on more important things.


145   I parked out in front and no sooner did I get the car door
146   open
147   than the rummy downstairs said,
148   "hey, ace, how about a cold one?"
149   I took a beer out of the bag and slipped it in through the
150   screen.
151   "I need a dollar," he said.
152   "now, ain't that a bitch? I was just gonna ask you for the
153   same thing."
154   "you're in a bad mood," he said.
155   "sure," I said, "haven't you heard? Faulkner's dead."
156   "Faulkner? wasn't he a bullring jock? Pomona Fairgrounds?
157   Rudioso? Caliente? you knew the kid?"
158   "I knew the kid," I said
159   and then walked on upstairs.


160   the rest of the night was no-account, as the Arkies say,
161   and there were a couple of numbers I could dial,
162   4 or 5 numbers, some black, some white,
163   some old, some young,
164   but I kept thinking of white hospitals
165   and palm trees in the shade,
166   and it was quiet, at last it was quiet,

[Page 157 ]


167   and there are times when you have to come back
168   and look around, there are times of Ludwig,
169   there are times of walls,
170   there are times of thinking of Ernest
171   and that shotgun raised to his head;
172   there are times for thinking
173   of dead loves, dead flowers,
174   of all the dead, dead people who give you a name,
175   from Florida to Del Mar, Calif.,
176   all the sadness like a parade
177   of gentle fools gone,
178   water running in sinks,
179   stockings washed,
180   gowns worn, thrown away,
181   the ugly duckling world
182   quietly slipping away from me
183   and myself slipping away,
184   an old tiger,
185   sick of the battle.


186   the next morning I was awakened by a knock on the door,
187   so I ignored it, I never answer the door,
188   I don't want to see anybody,
189   but it kept up with a kind of gentle persistence
190   so I got up and put on my old yellow robe
191   dead voices from bedrooms
192   and opened the door.
193   "I am here to help the handicapped people," she said.
194   "do come in," I said.
195   she was a young girl 19, 20, 21,
196   her eyes as innocent as the map of Texas spread
197   over the clouds,
198   and she walked across the rug and sat down
199   and I went into the kitchen and took the cap
200   off of 2 beers. my goldfish swam like crazy.
201   I walked out with the beers, I said,

[Page 158 ]


202   "love must be always
203   because stones gone flat with leaning
204   take ships to sea
205   take cats and dogs and
206   everything."


207   she laughed and the day began without
208   error.

1   a guy told me,
2   you don't have to worry about worms when you're
3   dead
4   they never get to you
5   the body changes like in all different
6   ways---by the time
7   they've worked through the casket
8   things have happened and it
9   always happens
10   different---
11   they've dug up these old kings outa tombs, ya
12   know:
13   one guy was just
14   a little splotch of black
15   water, another had a
16   beard 18 feet long and another had
17   turned to a kind of rock-like
18   salt.


19   yeah? I said.
20   yeah, he said.


21   he knew /all/ these things.
22   he lived high in the hills and had these
23   tremendous brains.


24   before I left I reached out and
25   pulled the worms out of his
26   eyes nose belly shoes hair ears
27   and then he said

[Page 160 ]




28   good night
29   and I said
30   good night
31   and I got in my car and drove off


32   and the worms laughed
33   all the way home.

1   I finished my drink and went back
2   upstairs to hear the second half---
3   another piano concerto, and
4   2 are too many and
5   I couldn't make it out
6   having lost my program so
7   I left the place and drove 21 blocks
8   South and East
9   to where 2 flyweights
10   a Jap and a Mexican were
11   going at it. the
12   Mexican butted the Jap and
13   the Jap bled from a cut
14   above the eye
15   but only fought harder
16   he was grasshopper slim with
17   very thin arms but
18   hit very hard. it went all ten and
19   the Jap got the verdict. another
20   ten followed. I drank a lot of
21   beer
22   kept leaving to piss and
23   when I came back one time it
24   was over: k.o.,
25   and I walked out to my car and
26   since I was downtown I
27   drove to where I worked in the
28   daylight
29   to see if maybe the place looked less
30   painful and
31   I looked through the window and

[Page 162 ]


32   thought I saw Ralph the stockboy in
33   there
34   crawling around on his hands and his
35   knees. he was an odd one and
36   the secretaries were afraid of him
37   and I thought I should call the
38   police
39   but then I thought
40   I don't care if he raids the
41   place or sets it on
42   fire. I got back into my car
43   and took the freeway back to my
44   apartment.


45   I drank a couple glasses of scotch,
46   set the clock for 6:30
47   ate a vitamin
48   thought about a whore in Glendale
49   checked the ball scores
50   pissed again
51   turned out the lights
52   got into bed (alone)
53   didn't pray
54   thought of places like Japan and
55   Central Avenue
56   thought about the dead and
57   the famous
58   thought about dying
59   while the Thames went along without
60   me and the girls walked up and down the
61   sidewalks without me
62   and then I thought I wouldn't mind
63   so much
64   and went to sleep and
65   slept good.

/(dedicated to my betters)/



1   Wednesday, 24 July 1969; Morning Session (Robert Hansen
2   and Allen Truport):
3   discussed sure discussed
4   WORK HABITS. Bob ingests, ingests, ingests, so we get those
5   wonderfully turned---
6   Allen keeps large notebooks
7   wherein
8   he told us
9   he notes down EVERYTHING. a kind of spatial flowing
10   viewPOINT.
11   Allen says
12   he writes all the time as much as possible;
13   it's like hanging a coat in a closet: you've
14   got to get in there. reasonableness may not be
15   enchanting, but said Allen, it is REWARDING.
16   a big notebook, he said, by God that's the
17   THING!
18   like Genet on the sand
19   blowing cock!
20   Bob said:
21   what the primary interest is and should be is ingesting,
22   ingesting, a kind of pulmonary percussion indrawn, tightened
23   and
24   then placed upon the paper, the marble in tight order of grip,
25   allowing the function to be the (possible) anguish rather than
26   any
27   MESSAGE or a) art-order
28   b) audience-relationship.

[Page 164 ]


29   Allen: I want to write
30   ENOUGH POEMS
31   so that when I die
32   all the shit will be out of me, I mean the guff, the nonsense,
33   the turds yes, ah I mean---that I have expressed enough
34   ENOUGH you see to
35   free me.
36   R.H.---I realize the standard essence of all your POETRY;
37   I say content is an extension of form. we must barter
38   for a firmer divinity. the conduct of children,
39   for instance, is fairly free but
40   UNFORMED
41   and in the final
42   multiplication ... useless.
43   I would say that the difference between
44   Hansen and Truport is that Hansen KNOWS
45   what he is
46   doing.
47   Evening Session (R.H. and A.T.)
48   Bob says priests should stick to their robes and leave
49   POETRY
50   to him.
51   I agree
52   with this.
53   Allen says political poetry or poetry dealing with immediate
54   causes and reflections is
55   interesting, and interesting
56   goes well, badly written
57   or not, it appears IMPORTANT, is appears sympathetic
58   and the ONE THING I do not want to do is lose
59   my AUDIENCE.


60   Thursday, July 25th; no classes:
61   a dozen of us had gone over to Buchanan 106

[Page 165 ]


62   for the hell of
63   it
64   to use the lecture room
65   anyhow
66   but we found some WOMEN in there
67   and they appeared HOSTILE when we walked in and
68   even MORE hostile when we began talking about
69   POETRY.
70   their hostility is perhaps understandable because we
71   DON'T
72   tend to them.
73   they'll just have to WAIT until workshop
74   CLASSES to get a portion of our
75   attention.
76   but it was really something, all of us there together,
77   talking, TALKING,---Hansen, Truport, Missions, De Costro
78   Sevadov, and Starwort, all all
79   together
80   here in ONE room was
81   the heart of American POETRY
82   talking, my
83   god.


84   Friday, July 26th; Morning Session:
85   De Costro dominated the whole damned meeting. he has
86   big hands and many
87   IDEAS. Truport appears to be afraid
88   of De Costro. Hansen cools it. nobody gets along.
89   yet there is no
90   YELLING. these are /only/ poets.
91   De Costro says the root of the thing is transferred to the tree
92   and the tree dies and
93   becomes HISTORY
94   and that
95   generally

[Page 166 ]


96   history is pretty
97   disappointing, it's easier to chop down a
98   tree than a poem, he says, history chops
99   YOU down.
100   FUCK ALL MEANING! Bob suddenly screams.
101   then, in softer voice:
102   we ought to /discard/ .
103   we all agree that feeling is /everything/ and
104   we go out for coffee
105   leaving three girls sitting
106   there with their dresses hiked-up around their
107   HIPS.


108   Monday, July 29th; Morning Session:


109   I saw all FIVE OF THEM!!!
110   around a desk
111   TOGETHER:
112   Hansen, Truport,
113   De Costro,
114   Starwort and
115   Phillip Maxwell.
116   Phillip didn't ARGUE didn't say much
117   and left before the meeting was OVER
118   but explained he'd wait
119   OUTSIDE for the free lunch. his books haven't been
120   GOING well.
121   Starwort read his /Man on a Streetcar Running Backwards/
122   from /Bent Lily/ #8.
123   I couldn't really understand his
124   READING
125   but will have to see
126   the work in print before I make a
127   JUDGMENT.

[Page 167 ]


128   Maybe Allie Denby
129   will send me a
130   copy of the issue, tho, alas, I understand it is
131   now a RARE ITEM
132   going to $20 out of Fort Lauderdale.
133   the past can only take place in the PRESENT, if you
134   know what I mean, said
135   De Costro.
136   we all
137   nodded.
138   Truport said he was afraid of being BROKE. he was
139   lined up for one more session at the
140   U. of K.
141   but hadn't heard much
142   more. of course, he'd been moving
143   around quite a bit, in TOUCH and
144   OUT OF TOUCH:
145   Paris, Cuba, the Congo, India, Moscow and Denver, Colorado.
146   we spoke of /The Cantos/ .
147   Pound continually tries to find space
148   AREAS, ARENAS OF CONTOUR for his extra-cerebral
149   power-poetic
150   uningrained ... uncontrived soul-mind ... like a ... like a
151   whip lashing against the sides of an old
152   BARN.
153   we want a COMPLETE EMERGENCE, said De Costro.
154   nothing half nothing wilted
155   we want the poetic Christ-thing walking out of
156   the barn
157   and Teaching---not from the TOP-down
158   but through and through and
159   THROUGH.


160   god damn it to hell, said Starwort. suddenly.
161   in taking my notes I could not fit it into

[Page 168 ]


162   the
163   conversation.


164   First Workshop session with R.H.:
165   he seemed to say a lot that I didn't understand but
166   the others seemed to understand
167   and the session went well.
168   Bob looked well. I had a
169   HANGOVER.


170   Wednesday, July 31st; Morning Session (most of us there):


171   there were again the old arguments about Vietnam,
172   Cleaver and the Panthers, all of which, I am afraid, I
173   no longer
174   understand.
175   I am AFRAID
176   I am getting tired
177   although the others appear very
178   energetic.
179   I need SECURITY, said Hansen. I need a perpetual FATHER
180   and a GOOD JOB or my work is
181   HINDERED.
182   Allen read some of his early stuff. I understand some of it
183   but FRANKLY, I think he tends to
184   holler and OVERSTAGE.
185   I left with a
186   HEADACHE.


187   Friday, August 2nd; Morning Session:


188   Allen spoke of some of the poetry he had seen in
189   the campus shithouses and said it was pretty
190   GOOD.
191   then Wm. Burroughs was discussed

[Page 169 ]


192   his USE of timely and pertinent
193   news material that RELATED ...
194   by clipping out words in the paper
195   and pasting them in DIFFERENT ORDER
196   A NEW ORDER
197   was established
198   and a neutralization of time and event
199   WAS
200   established.
201   THIS WAs imporTANT. YeS. I'll sAY sO.
202   we all admitted we often read /Time/ and
203   /Pravda/ .
204   then Allen read
205   AGAIN
206   this time from UnpubliSHED
207   WoRk
208   dIrEcTly FrOM the JOuRnals
209   there were 250 people attending
210   and he read LOUDLY and I had another
211   HANGOVER.
212   he screamed for FORTYFIVE MINUTES! then became
213   TERRIBLY
214   exhausted, you couldn't hear him, his voice BECAME
215   a monotonous drone and he asked the audience:
216   may I stop now?
217   they applauded LOUDLY.


218   Sunday, August 4th:


219   the janitor had locked all the doors on the campus so
220   we met at Hansen's room and drank port wine. Denise and
221   Carol came up but they were SAFE
222   although everyone appeared a little sullen.
223   I think it was being LOCKED OUT like that.
224   later in the night Allen grew angry and slapped

[Page 170 ]


225   Bob. then Allen read his poetry again. it was
226   good being there all together all of us.
227   I have tried to take notes and hope you have
228   APPRECIATED THEM.
229   next summer I am sure we will be
230   INVITED BACK
231   and I look forward
232   EAGERLY
233   to these great American poets
234   and their DISCUSSION of what makes POETRY GO, what it
235   iS! !
236   AnD To haVE them rEaD thEiR OWN WORKS OnCe

        Bukowski, Charles :  /one for Ging, with klux top/ [from The
        Days Run Away Like Wild Horses Over the Hills (1969) , Black
        Sparrow Press ]



1   I live among rats and roaches
2   but there is this high-rise apt., a new one
3   across from me, glimmering pool, lived in by very young
4   people with new cars, mostly red or white cars,
5   and I allow myself to look upon this scene as
6   some type of miracle world
7   not because it is possibly so
8   but because it is easier to think this way,
9   ---why take more knives?---
10   so today I sat here and I saw one young man
11   sitting in his red car
12   sucking his thumb and waiting
13   as another young man, obviously his friend,
14   talked to a young woman dressed in kind of long slim short
15   pants, yes, and a black ill-fitting blouse,
16   and she had on some kind of high-pointed hat, rather
17   like the kukluxklan wear, and the other young man sucked,
18   sat and
19   sucked his thumb
20   in the
21   red car and
22   behind them, through the glass door
23   the other young people sat and sat and sat and sat
24   around the blue pool,
25   and the young woman was angry
26   she was ugly anyhow and now she was very ugly
27   but she must have had something to interest the young man
28   and she said something violent and final
29   (I couldn't hear any of it)
30   and walked off west, away from the young man and the
31   building,

[Page 172 ]


32   and the young man was flushed in the face, seemingly more
33   stunned
34   than angry, and then they both sat in the car for a while,
35   and then the other young man took his thumb out of his
36   mouth, and started the red car, and then they were
37   gone.


38   and through my window and through the glass door
39   I could see the other young people
40   sitting sitting sitting
41   around the blue pool. my miracle crowd, my future
42   leaders.


43   to make it round out, I decided that the night before
44   the young man (not the one with the thumb) had tried
45   to screw the ugly girl in the pointed hat while they were both
46   drunk, and that the ugly girl in the pointed hat
47   felt---for some reason---that this was a damned dirty trick.
48   she acted bit parts in little theatre---was said to have talent---
49   had a fairly wealthy father, and her name was Gig or
50   Ging or
51   something odd like that---and that was mainly why the boys
52   wanted to
53   screw her: because her first name was Gig or Ging
54   or Aszpupu,
55   and the boys wanted to say, very much wanted to say:
56   "I balled with Ging last night."


57   all right, so having settled all that,
58   I put on some coffee and rolled myself something
59   calming.

1   we ran the women in a straight line down to the river
2   clinging to the fear in their rice-stupid heads
3   clinging to their infants
4   mice-like sucklings breathing in the air at odds of
5   one thousand to one;
6   we shot the men as they kneeled in a circle,
7   and the death of the men held almost no death,
8   it was somehow like a movie film,
9   men of spider arms and legs and a hunk of cloth
10   to cover the sexual organ.
11   men hardly born could hardly be killed
12   and there they were down there now, finally dead,
13   the sun straining on their faces of weird
14   puzzlement.


15   some of the women could fire rifles. we left a small
16   detachment to decide upon
17   them. then we fired up the unburned huts and moved on
18   to the next village.

14   so I get ready to
15   kill them both
16   but
17   relent:


18   I don't even
19   look like
20   myself---
21   rightsideup, so.
22   shit on it!
23   I tickle again, say

26   hope
27   all the while
28   that this
29   very unappetizing

31   does not blow up

14   that I suffer more than

18   neither talk about their virtues or

4   feeling all the space of ground
5   feeling the sunshine
6   and
7   looking for somebody.


8   it stood there.


9   it seemed that even the sun was afraid of the
10   bull.


11   the matador screamed something
12   shook and flagged the cape.
13   the bull came at him.
14   he gave him the cape. but the mat did not get very
15   close.


16   then the bull saw the padded
17   horse, the blindfolded horse,
18   and he trotted over
19   and began working his horns against the horse's
20   side and underside.


21   the pic
22   there on top of the horse
23   lanced him good
24   he stuck him deep and hard with the
25   pole
26   really muscling it in

[Page 180 ]


27   screwing it in deep
28   right in the top part of the back there
29   up near the neck.


30   this makes the bull go more for the horse---
31   he probably thinks the horse is doing it to him---
32   and as he goes more for the horse
33   he gets drilled more and more
34   by the chickenshit
35   lance.


36   the bull left the horse
37   went for the cape
38   then came back to the horse.
39   then he got another drilling by the
40   pic.


41   he does not any longer quite look like the
42   bull who first ran into the ring.
43   but they haven't cut him down enough
44   they have something else for
45   him: the banderillas.


46   short sharp pieces that are jammed into the upper back
47   and neck, the placement of these does /appear/
48   dangerous.
49   no cape is used and these young Mexican boys
50   stupid and with dirty
51   behinds
52   they leap into the air and make the
53   placements as the bull runs
54   by.


55   we watched them make the
56   placements.

[Page 181 ]




57   now the bull was properly ready for the matador to be
58   brave.
59   the neck and back muscles were severed, shredded in
60   many places.
61   the head came
62   down.


63   Harry took a drink. "these Mexican bulls aren't any
64   good. you oughta see the Spanish bulls. they got horns
65   like this":
66   he showed me how they had horns like that. with his
67   hands. then we both had a
68   drink.


69   the matador did not seem to get in very
70   close. the bull kept getting in those
71   tired and desperate lunges at the cape
72   getting more and more winded
73   more and more
74   useless.


75   each of the matador's movements had some meaning, some
76   name. the Mexicans knew it. the drunken Americans in the
77   shade with good jobs and subnormal wives
78   didn't know anything. they rooted for the
79   bull.
80   they didn't know that it took guts
81   to even do a bad job with the bull.


82   well, this bull was bad and the matador was bad
83   but the matador was worse than the
84   bull, and I guess that's about as bad as the act can
85   get.
86   except when the bull is so much less worse than the
87   matador and the mat gets gored and the Americans go
88   home happy and

[Page 182 ]


89   fuck all night
90   trying to forget about the job in the
91   morning.


92   kill time came. the mat knew what to do. he knew the
93   spot. it was like running a hot poker into a
94   barrel of loose tin foil.


95   the bull
96   beaten and stabbed about the neck and back
97   winded totally by ripping at a vision of a
98   red cape that only
99   gave, gave, gave
100   folded over the horn forever---
101   the bull was winded /spiritually/ as
102   well.
103   and finally stood
104   disgusted and doomed
105   looking
106   LOOKING.


107   we had another
108   drink. we knew the plot, the hero, the whole
109   fucking thing. the sword went
110   in.


111   but it wasn't
112   over.
113   the bull stood there.
114   and with the sword cutting his vitals
115   they came up.


116   4 or 5 Mexicans with dirty
117   behinds. including the
118   mat.

[Page 183 ]




119   and they turned
120   him. flicked their capes at
121   him. punched him on the
122   nose.


123   still he wouldn't
124   fall.
125   they were trying to push him into death
126   but he was hanging
127   in.


128   and every now and then
129   the head would remember
130   and give a lunge of
131   horn and
132   they would step back
133   remembering their own deaths.


134   then the mat came up
135   pulled the sword
136   out, stuck it home
137   again.


138   still no good.
139   the bull would not go
140   down.


141   we had another drink.


142   "you see," said Harry, "they keep turning him. that
143   sword is cutting him. every time they make him move,
144   the sword cuts again."


145   finally somebody took his foot and
146   kicked the bull over and the bull
147   fell down.

[Page 184 ]




148   but still
149   it wasn't any
150   good.
151   the bull kept kicking his
152   legs, trying to get
153   up. he wouldn't
154   quit.


155   so then a little fat chap came
156   out. he was all dressed in white and wore a little
157   white butcher's cap. he seemed quite
158   angry.
159   he had a short blade and walked up
160   and very angry and quick
161   he chopped and chopped and chopped and
162   chopped. it appeared that he was chopping at the
163   bull's head, his
164   brain.


165   the bull couldn't get at the boy in the
166   butcher's cap. he had to
167   take it. finally one of the chops
168   took.


169   you could SEE the bull
170   die. the bull gave it
171   up. the crowd
172   cheered.


173   Harry took a
174   drink, that was the end of that
175   pint. and that
176   matador.

[Page 185 ]




177   "what's the name of the next
178   bull?" I asked
179   Harry.


180   "I don't know. the light is
181   bad."


182   anyhow, the next bull came
183   out.


184   we had one more pint and the
185   drive back in.

7   I watch an old woman beat her cat

9   the weather is unendurable
10   a dirty trick by

12   the water has evaporated from the

32   air-conditioned troops go from house to
33   house
34   from room to room
35   jailing, shooting, bayoneting
36   the people.
37   we have done this to ourselves, we
38   deserve this
39   we are like roses that have never bothered to
40   bloom when we should have bloomed and
41   it is as if
42   the sun has become disgusted with
43   waiting
44   it is as if the sun were a mind that has
45   given up on us.
46   I go out on the back porch
47   and look across the sea of dead plants
48   now thorns and sticks shivering in a
49   windless sky.
50   somehow I'm glad we're through
51   finished---
52   the works of Art
53   the wars
54   the decayed loves
55   the way we lived each day.
56   when the troops come up here
57   I don't care what they do for
58   we already killed ourselves
59   each day we got out of bed.
60   I go back into the kitchen
61   spill some hash from a soft
62   can, it is almost cooked
63   already
64   and I sit
65   eating, looking at my

67   the sweat comes down behind my

1   the place was crowded.
2   the editor told me,
3   "Charley get some chairs from upstairs,
4   there are more chairs upstairs."
5   I brought them down and we opened the beer and
6   the editor said,
7   "we're not getting enough advertising,
8   the boat might go down,"
9   so they started talking about how to get
10   advertising.
11   I kept drinking the beer
12   and had to piss
13   and when I got back
14   the girl next to me said,
15   "we ought to evacuate the city,
16   that's what we ought to do."


17   I said, "I'd rather listen to Joseph Haydn."


18   she said, "just /think/ of it,
19   if everybody left the city!"


20   "they'd only be someplace else
21   stinking it up," I said.


22   "I don't think you like
23   people," she said, pulling her short skirt down
24   as much as possible.


25   "just to fuck with," I said.

[Page 192 ]




26   then I went to the bar next door and
27   bought 3 more packs of beer.
28   when I got back they were talking Revolution.
29   so here I was back in 1935 again,
30   only I was old and they were young. I was at least
31   20 years older than anybody in the room,
32   and I thought, what the hell am I doing
33   here?


34   soon the meeting ended
35   and they went out into the night,
36   those young ones
37   and I picked up the phone, I got
38   John T.,
39   "John, you o.k.? I'm low tonight.
40   suppose I come over and get
41   drunk?"


42   "sure, Charley, we'll be waiting."


43   "Charley," said the editor, "I guess we've got to
44   put the chairs back
45   upstairs."


46   we carried the chairs back upstairs
47   the
48   revolution was
49   over.

1   100 million Chinese bugs on the stairway to
2   hell,
3   come drink with me
4   rub my back with me;
5   this filth-pitched room,
6   floor covered with yellow newspapers
7   3 weeks old; bottle caps, a red
8   pencil, a rip of
9   toilet paper, these odd bits of
10   broken things;
11   the flies worry me as ice cream ladies
12   walk past my window;
13   at night I sleep, try to sleep
14   between mounds of stinking laundry;
15   ghosts come out,
16   play dirty games, evil games, games of horror with
17   my mind;
18   in the morning there is blood on the sheet
19   from a broken sore upon my
20   back.


21   putting on a shirt that rips across my
22   back, rotten rag of a thing,
23   and putting on pants with a rip in the
24   crotch, I find in the mailbox
25   (along with other threats):
26   "Dear Mr. Bukowski:
27   Would like to see more of your poems for
28   possible inclusion in
29   ---Poetry Review.


30   How's it going?"

1   some people are young and nothing
2   else and
3   some people are old and nothing
4   else
5   and some people are in between and
6   just in between.


7   and if the flies wore clothes on their
8   backs
9   and all the buildings burned in
10   golden fire,
11   if heaven shook like a belly
12   dancer
13   and all the atom bombs began to
14   cry,
15   some people would be young and nothing
16   else and
17   some people old and nothing

19   and the rest would be the same
20   the rest would be the same.

1   wondrous, sure, kid, you want more
2   applejuice? how can you drink that goddamned
3   stuff? I hate it. what? no, I'm not Dr.
4   Vogel. I'm the daddy. your old man. where's mama?
5   she's out joining an artist's colony. oh, that's a place
6   where people go who aren't
7   artists. yes, that's the way it works almost
8   everywhere. sometimes you can go into a hospital and
9   it can be 40 floors high and there won't be a doctor in
10   there, and hard to find a nurse either.
11   what's a hospital? a hospital is just a bunch of
12   disconnected buttons, dying people and very sophisticated and
13   comfortable orderlies. but the whole world is like this:
14   nobody knows what they are supposed to know---
15   poets can't write poetry
16   mechanics can't fix your car
17   fighters can't fight
18   lovers can't love
19   preachers can't preach. it's even like that with
20   armies: whole armies led without generals,
21   whole nations led without leaders, why the whole thing is like
22   trying to copulate with a wooden
23   dick ... oh, pardon me!
24   how old are you? three? three. ah. three fingers, that's nice!
25   you learn fast, my little ducky. what? more
26   applejuice? o.k.
27   you wanna play train? you wanna take me for a ride?
28   o.k., Tucson, we'll go to Tucson, what the hell!
29   damn it, I don't KNOW if we're there yet, you're
30   driving!
31   what? we're on the way BACK already?

[Page 197 ]


32   you want some candy? shit, you been eatin' candy for hours!
33   listen, I don't KNOW when your mother will be back, uh?
34   well,
35   after signing up for the artist's colony she's going to a poetry
36   reading. what's a poetry reading? a poetry reading is where
37   people gather and read their poetry to each other, the ones
38   mostly who can't write poetry.
39   what's poetry? nobody knows. it changes. it works by itself
40   like a snail crawling up the side of a house. oh, that's a big
41   squashy thing that goes all gooey and slimy when you
42   step on
43   it. am I a snail?
44   I guess so kid, what?
45   you wanna kaakaa?
46   o.k., go ahead. can you get your own pants down? I don't
47   see
48   you very often. oh, you want the light on? you want me
49   to stay
50   or go away? stay? fine, then.
51   now kaakaa, little one, that's it ...
52   kaakaa ...
53   so you can grow up to be a big woman and
54   do what big women
55   do.
56   kaakaa.
57   at's it, sweet,
58   ain't it /funny?/
59   mama kaakaa too.
60   oh /yeah/


61   /wow!/
62   that's all right!
63   now wipe your ass.
64   no, better than
65   /that!/ there, that's
66   better.

[Page 198 ]


67   you say /I'm/ kaakaa!
68   hey that's
69   good! I like that!
70   very funny.


71   now let's go get some more beer and
72   applejuice.

1   she lived in a small room by the freeway and she
2   wrote like a man---somebody who worked on the dock
3   ---and I tapped on her window and she let me in, I
4   climbed through the window and I sat down as the
5   stupid fingers of my mind reached around the room,
6   I told her I had been on a drunk and that I had to
7   cut my toenails (they hurt) and I told her that
8   there were a lot of people getting on my nerves like
9   a broken glove compartment and she walked over and
10   kissed me, asked if I wanted coffee and if I had
11   been eating, and then she told me her radio was brok-
12   en---she had dropped it on the floor. and I took a
13   knife blade and worked at the screws in the back.
14   be careful, she said, it says
15   there is danger of shock, and I told
16   her: I am immortal, I can't get or
17   be killed.


18   she set a cheese sandwich and a cup of coffee in
19   front of me and I straightened up the loose tubes,
20   there seemed to be no broken ones, but it was get-
21   ting to be time for the first race and I told her,
22   Jesus, I don't have time!
23   if you're immortal, she said,
24   you have plenty of time.


25   I ate the cheese sandwich and drank the coffee.
26   see you tonight, I said, I'll
27   put the god damned thing together
28   tonight.

[Page 202 ]




29   I climbed out the window and into my car. the sun
30   came down in the dust and dirt of the parking lot
31   making everything a good soft yellow and brown, and
32   the vines on the fence smelled green the way green
33   smells, and I drove out backing up, waving to her
34   through the windshield and she stood in the window
35   waving and smiling, and I backed up the alley and
36   around the street, put it in forward and ran
37   along the pavement toward the freeway, out of there,
38   thinking about what I had done or hadn't done to
39   the radio (or her), feeling as if I had left an
40   army in trouble during battle, but then some kid
41   in a Volks
42   cut across me without a signal
43   and I forgot about all the rest
44   and I pushed the pedal down and

        Bukowski, Charles :  /the miracle/ [from The Days Run Away Like
        Wild Horses Over the Hills (1969) , Black Sparrow Press ]


1   To work with an art form
2   does not mean to
3   screw off like a tapeworm
4   with his belly full,
5   nor does it justify grandeur
6   or greed, nor at all times
7   seriousness, but I would guess
8   that it calls upon the best men
9   at their best times,
10   and when they die
11   and something else does not,
12   we have seen the miracle of immortality:
13   men arrived as men,
14   departed as gods---
15   gods we knew were here,
16   gods that now let us go on
17   when all else says stop.

1   Mongolian coasts shining in light,
2   I listen to the pulse of the sun,
3   the tiger is the same to all of us
4   and high oh
5   so high on the branch
6   our oriole
7   sings.

# Summer Networks ('16)
Neural Network examples and experiments performed during the summer of 2016. Mostly theano and numpy.

* **[Numpy Network](https://github.com/masta-g3/summer_networks/blob/master/neural_networks.ipynb):** Numpy-based implementation of a neural network for 2D classification (reference: [WildML](http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/implementing-a-neural-network-from-scratch/)).

* **[Numpy Bukowski](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/summer/summer_networks/numpy_bukowski/numpy_bukowski.ipynb)**: Recurrent neural network (RNN) using numpy. The input data are Bukowski's poems, and the output generated sentences that kinda look like his (reference: [WildML](http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/recurrent-neural-networks-tutorial-part-2-implementing-a-language-model-rnn-with-python-numpy-and-theano/)).

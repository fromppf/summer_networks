# Summer Networks ('16)
Neural Network examples and experiments performed during the summer of 2016. Mostly Theano and Numpy, based on WildML's tutorials.

* [**Numpy Network**](https://github.com/masta-g3/summer_networks/blob/master/numpy_networks.ipynb): Numpy-based implementation of a neural network for 2D classification (reference: [WildML](http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/implementing-a-neural-network-from-scratch/)).

* [**Theano Network**](https://github.com/masta-g3/summer_networks/blob/master/theano_networks.ipynb): Same example as above, but using a Theano implementation instead (reference: [WildML](http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/speeding-up-your-neural-network-with-theano-and-the-gpu/)).

* [**Numpy Bukowski**](https://github.com/masta-g3/summer_networks/blob/master/numpy_bukowski/numpy_bukowski.ipynb): Recurrent neural network (RNN) using numpy. The input data are Bukowski's poems, and the output generated sentences that kinda look like his (reference: [WildML](http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/recurrent-neural-networks-tutorial-part-2-implementing-a-language-model-rnn-with-python-numpy-and-theano/)).
